CNA Financial Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Remarks
Douglas M. Worman, President and Chief Executive Officer:
We are pleased with our exceptional second quarter results driven by strong investment income and 
excellent underwriting gain.  Our underwriting gain of $150 million was up 21% from the prior year second 
quarter.  The underlying underwriting gain of $213 million was the ninth consecutive quarter of $200 million 
or more.  We grew gross written premiums excluding captives 5% while maintaining strong underwriting 
discipline, and catastrophe losses were lower year over year.  We achieved higher net investment income 
and solid top-line growth, and in the U.S, rate was stable – including double-digit rate increases in our 
commercial casualty classes of business, which continue to exceed loss cost trends.
Core income was $335 million, an increase of $9 million over the prior year quarter.  Core income was 
impacted by an $88 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development associated with 
legacy mass tort abuse reserves, inclusive of the anticipated agreement in principle with regards to the 
Diocese of Rochester.  Net investment income of $662 million increased $44 million year over year, with 
equal contributions from the fixed income portfolio from growth in both book yield and our invested asset 
base, and strong limited partnership and common stock performance.
The P&C all-in combined ratio was 94.1% in the second quarter, including $62 million or 2.4 points, of 
catastrophe losses.  The catastrophe loss ratio was more than a point lower than our second quarter average 
over the past five years. Prior period development was negligible in the quarter.  The P&C underlying 
combined ratio was 91.7%.  The underlying loss ratio was 61.5%, in line with the first quarter, and the 
expense ratio was 29.8%, the lowest since 2008.
Gross written premiums excluding captives grew 5% and net written premiums grew 6% in the quarter.  
Growth was impacted by lower retentions in certain isolated segments within the Commercial and Specialty 
portfolios this quarter.  In each case this was reflective of portfolio underwriting actions on specific accounts 
where our underwriters could not obtain pricing, terms and conditions appropriate to the risk.  We execute 
our strategies in a very nuanced way, and while the market overall is rational, there are certain small pockets 
within individual lines and geographies where we believe the external loss cost environment is not being 
appropriately reflected.  In those areas, we will not trade bottom line profit for growth.  We continue to take 
advantage of attractive opportunities across the market in our areas of specialization, which is evidenced by 
our new business growth of 8% in the quarter to $645 million with positive growth in all three operating 
segments.
P&C rate increase was 3% in the quarter and renewal premium change was 5%, each down one point from 
last quarter.  The decrease was driven by International, which has been profitable for several years, and 
pricing pressure in national accounts property.  In the U.S., which has been more significantly impacted by 
social inflation, rates were consistent with last quarter at 5%.
In the Commercial segment, the all-in combined ratio was 94.8%, a 2.2 point improvement from the prior 
year quarter.  Catastrophe losses were $57 million or 4.2 points, 1.9 points lower than the prior year quarter, 
and prior period development was negligible overall.  The underlying combined ratio was 90.6%.  The 
expense ratio was 27.2%, an improvement of 1.3 points year over year, remaining below 28% for the fourth 
consecutive quarter.  The underlying loss ratio was 62.9%, consistent with the first quarter.
Gross written premiums excluding captives grew by 6% in the quarter and net written premium growth was 
7%.  New business was $420 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter.  New business growth was lower in 
the second quarter compared to some recent quarters as a result of our prudent underwriting in commercial 
auto, where terms and conditions on many account opportunities would not provide the rate of return we 
believe appropriate in that line of business.
Rate increase for the Commercial segment was 5% in the quarter and renewal premium change was 6%, 
each down a point compared to the first quarter.  We have seen substantial rate reductions in national 
accounts property, where rate was five points lower than the first quarter.  Property rates, excluding national 
                       
1
accounts, are still high single-digit.  Excess casualty rate remained low double-digit in the quarter, 
commercial auto rate was 20%, and primary general liability rates are still in the mid single-digit range.  For 
Commercial excluding national accounts property, the rate increase in the first half of the year was the 
highest it has been since the peak of the hard market in the first quarter of 2021.
Exposure change was 1% in aggregate with variation by line.  Exposure change was 3% in workers’ 
compensation and 4% in primary general liability where exposure can act more like rate.  Exposure change 
was down 2% in excess casualty as we continue to opportunistically reposition attachment points and limits 
in light of the continued impact of social inflation.  Retention was 81% in the second quarter.  In commercial 
auto, retention was several points lower than the overall average, whereas in workers’ compensation which 
has been very profitable for us, retention was a few points higher.  
Within Specialty, the all-in and underlying combined ratios were 93.6%.  The expense ratio was 33.2% and 
the underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, consistent with the last several quarters.
Gross written premiums excluding captives grew by 3% and net written premiums grew by 4%.  Rate 
increased by 3%, consistent with the first quarter when rates reached the highest level since 2022.  In 
financial institutions and management liability, we achieved an aggregate rate increase of 1%, the first 
quarter of positive rate after ten consecutive quarters of negative rate.  Notably, rate was positive in both 
public directors and officers ( D&O) and cyber again this quarter, similar to last quarter.  New business grew 
3% to $122 million in the quarter.  Retention was still quite strong at 86% but was down three points 
compared to last quarter.  Retention was lower by five points in financial institutions and management 
liability where we continue to optimize our decisions against the backdrop of a protracted soft pricing 
environment in those lines.
In International, the all-in combined ratio was 92.8% in the quarter, including $5 million or 1.4 points of 
catastrophe loss compared to 2.0 points in the prior year quarter.  The underlying combined ratio was 91.4%.  
The underlying loss ratio was 58.5%, consistent with the first quarter.  The expense ratio was 32.9%.  We 
have had tremendous success improving our International portfolio and we are committed to continuing to 
focus and capitalize on opportunities in the International portfolio as it contributes meaningfully and 
positively to our overall results. 
Gross written premiums were up 5% and 4% excluding currency fluctuations.  Net written premiums were up 
9% and 7% excluding currency fluctuations.  New business was $103 million, up 43%, as we continued to 
lean into opportunities in our target specializations.  Rates continue to be impacted by competition but our 
retention remains quite strong at 86% as we hold on to our portfolio which has been consistently profitable 
and has produced twenty consecutive quarters of underwriting profitability.
I would like to highlight our recently announced launch of Cardinal E&S, A CNA Brand, furthering our 
dedication to serving the excess and surplus (E&S) market.  This strategic expansion reinforces CNA’s 
continued commitment to delivering specialized solutions.  Cardinal E&S will continue to partner with our 
wholesale brokers through our dedicated, specialized underwriting teams focused on casualty, property, 
healthcare and financial lines, and a commitment to deep expertise, rapid response times and customized 
solutions. 
In the second quarter we had extremely successful renewals of our property reinsurance treaties on June 1st.  
On these renewals, we achieved very favorable terms, conditions, and pricing consistent with our experience 
and continued prudent portfolio management of catastrophe risk.  We renewed our treaties based on the 
scale of our operating portfolios, buying a structure where the economics made the most sense for us as an 
organization.  We believe this excellent result demonstrates the strength of our portfolio.

Scott R. Lindquist, Chief Financial Officer:
CNA’s core income of $335 million is up from $326 million in the prior year quarter, leading to a core return 
on equity of 11.0%, and reflects another quarter of strong underwriting and investment results.
Our P&C expense ratio for the second quarter was 29.8% compared to 30.7% in the prior year quarter, 
reflecting higher net earned premiums and a favorable acquisition ratio.  While we tend to have a certain 
amount of variability quarter to quarter, we do expect the expense ratio to continue to track at approximately 
30% for the balance of 2025.
The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was flat in the current quarter.  In the 
Specialty segment, favorable development in surety was offset by unfavorable development in other 
professional liability and management liability.  In the Commercial segment, favorable development in 
workers’ compensation was offset by unfavorable development in general liability.  
For Life & Group, we recorded core income of $1 million for the second quarter compared to a $1 million 
core loss for the prior year quarter, with both underwriting and investment results being generally in-line with 
the prior year quarter.  Results for the quarter benefited from favorable persistency, somewhat offset by 
lower investment income.  We also note that, consistent with historical practice, we intend to perform our 
annual assumption updates for our Life & Group segment during the third quarter.
Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $114 million in the second quarter, compared to a $53 
million loss in the prior year quarter.  As a reminder and as we stated previously, we conduct a 
comprehensive review of mass tort reserves in the second quarter of each year.  As a result of this quarter’s 
comprehensive review, the Corporate segment results include an $88 million after-tax charge related to 
unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort abuse claim activity, the on-
going effects of social inflation and the anticipated agreement in principle with regards to the Diocese of 
Rochester.  We also note that, consistent with historical practice, we intend to review our asbestos & 
environmental reserves within the Corporate segment in the fourth quarter.  
Net investment income was $662 million in the second quarter compared with $618 million in the prior year 
quarter, an increase of 7%.  The increase was driven by fixed income investments and our limited partnership  
and common stock portfolios.
Fixed income and other investments generated $562 million of income, up 4% compared to the prior year 
quarter.  Our A-rated fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent contributions to core income, 
which have been steadily increasing because of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flow from 
operations.  The effective income yield of our consolidated fixed income portfolio was 4.9% in the second 
quarter, up from 4.8% in the prior year quarter.  Reinvestment rates continue to be above our P&C portfolio 
effective income yield of 4.4% and are slightly above our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield of 
5.7%. 
Looking ahead, based on the current interest rate environment we expect income from fixed income and 
other investments to be about $565 million in the third quarter.  For the full year, we expect income from 
fixed income and other investments to be about $2,250 million, or a 3% increase as compared to the full year 
2024. 
Our limited partnership and common stock portfolio returned a $100 million gain, or 3.6%, in the current 
quarter compared to a $78 million gain, or 3.1%, in the prior year’s quarter.  This quarter’s 3.6% return was 
primarily driven by our hedge fund limited partnerships  and common stock portfolio (both of which are 
generally reported real-time), where performance reflected the broader public equity market’s strong 
performance during the quarter.  
Net investment losses were $36 million in the second quarter, compared with net investment losses in the 
prior year quarter of $9 million, and were driven primarily by fixed maturity disposals arising from normal 
course portfolio management activities.

At quarter-end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity excluding 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $12.3 billion, or $45.31 per share, an increase of 4% 
from year-end 2024 adjusting for dividends.  Stockholders' equity including AOCI was $10.7 billion or $39.45 
per share.  With the decline in interest rates during the first half of the year, the net unrealized investment 
loss in our fixed income portfolio decreased to $1.9 billion as of quarter-end.  Finally, we ended the quarter 
with statutory capital and surplus in the combined Continental Casualty Companies of $11.2 billion.
Operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion for the first six months of 2025, which is up 7% as compared to 
the first six months of 2024.  The higher cash flow reflects continued strong underwriting and investing 
results.
Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on core income for the second quarter was 21.4%, which is in line with 
our full year 2025 expectations.
Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share to be paid on 
September 4, 2025 to stockholders of record on August18, 2025.
Douglas M. Worman, President and Chief Executive Officer:
To wrap this up, CNA achieved 5% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives and 6% growth in net 
written premiums.  We achieved very strong cash flow and excellent investment returns, while continuing 
with our disciplined execution of our underwriting strategies.  Our underlying underwriting gain of $213 
million is the ninth consecutive quarter in excess of $200 million and our underlying combined ratio was 
92.0% for the first half of the year.  Our catastrophe ratio is below our five year average for the quarter and for 
the first half of the year.  We very successfully renewed all of our major property reinsurance treaties in the 
quarter and we had an extraordinary launch of Cardinal E&S with strong support from our distribution 
partners.   
Over the years, we have generated attractive underwriting margins, built an excellent investment portfolio, 
and established top tier staff to continue driving positive momentum.  We have established differentiated 
business profiles in the areas of our specialization which allows us to manage through adverse markets.  We 
are proud of our results through the first half of 2025 and look forward to a successful second half of the 
year.

Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures
These earnings remarks contain financial measures that are not in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  Management utilizes these financial measures 
to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio.  The Company believes the 
presentation of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that 
comprise the Company's operating performance.  Reconciliations of these measures to the most 
comparable GAAP measures follow below.
Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Core Income (Loss)
Core income (loss)  is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of net investment 
gains or losses and gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions.  Net investment gains or 
losses are excluded from the calculation of core income (loss) because they are generally driven by 
economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of our primary operations.  The calculation of core 
income (loss) excludes gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions as they result from 
decisions regarding our defined benefit pension plans which are unrelated to our primary operations.  
Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance.  
Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure.

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share to Core Income (Loss) per Diluted Share
Core income (loss) per diluted share provides management and investors with a valuable measure of the 
Company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core income 
(loss).  Core income (loss) per diluted share is core income (loss) on a per diluted share basis .

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Underwriting Gain (Loss) and Underlying Underwriting Gain 
(Loss)
Underwriting gain (loss)  is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated pretax as net 
earned premiums less total insurance expenses, which includes insurance claims and policyholders' 
benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and insurance related administrative expenses.  Net 
income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Management believes that underwriting gain 
(loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from our underwriting 
activities which are managed separately from our investing activities. 
Underlying underwriting gain (loss)  is also deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and represents 
pretax underwriting results excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items.  Management 
believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate the profitability, before tax, derived from 
our underwriting activities, excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, which are unpredictable as to timing 
and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year underwriting 
performance.

Components to reconcile the combined ratio and loss ratio to the underlying combined ratio and 
underlying loss ratio
The underlying loss ratio  excludes the impact of catastrophe losses and development-related items from 
the loss ratio.  The  underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss ratio, the expense ratio and 
the dividend ratio.  The underlying loss ratio and the underlying combined ratio are deemed to be non-GAAP 
financial measures, and management believes some investors may find these ratios useful to evaluate our 
underwriting performance since they remove the impact of catastrophe losses which are unpredictable as to 
timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of our current year 
underwriting performance.

Reconciliation of Book Value per Share to Book Value per Share Excluding AOCI
Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) allows 
management and investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth primarily attributable to the 
Company's business operations.  The Company believes this measurement is useful as it reduces the effect 
of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.
