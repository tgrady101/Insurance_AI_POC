      "raw_bytes": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 19, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report a terrific start to the year, including an excellent bottom-line result for the quarter, particularly in light of the high level of severe weather activity across the United States and very strong production in all three of our business segments, which produced net written premium growth of 12% for the quarter. Profitability and growth in our Business Insurance segment were particularly strong. And as you'll hear from Michael, we're positioned for improved profitability in our Personal Lines business. Core income for the quarter was $970 million, or $4.11 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 14.5%. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.9 billion, up 10% compared to the prior-year period, an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6% and a one-time tax benefit. Catastrophe losses were elevated as the industry experienced the highest number of Q1 PCS catastrophe events since PCS started tracking in the 1950s. Turning to investments. Our high-quality portfolio generated net investment income of $557 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and positive returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to return $680 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $462 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business as we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In light of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.00 per share, marking 19 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. The Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. Turning to the top-line in production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by 12% this quarter to a record $9.4 billion, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 15% to $5.2 billion. You may recall that we entered into a quota share arrangement with Fidelis for 2023. This contributed about $160 million, or around 3.5 percentage points, net written premium growth in the segment. Results from the quota share are not reflected in our production statistics. Renewal premium change in Business Insurance remained historically high at 9.6%. Pure renewal rate change ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter, driven by the property, umbrella and auto lines. Even with continued strong pricing broadly, retention in Business Insurance was very strong at 87%. New business of $639 million was a record and up 17% from the prior-year period. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased slightly from a very strong level in the prior-year quarter, with excellent retention of 90% and new business growth of 25% in our management liability business, and a record level of Q1 net written premium in our surety business. Given the attractive returns and the high quality of business in our commercial segments, we are very pleased with strong production results in these businesses. In Personal Insurance, top-line growth of 12% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change increased to 20.2% in our homeowners and other business, and a 13.9% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the year ahead. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. In light of the recent disruption in the banking sector, I'd like to share a reminder about how our business differs from those in the headlines. We often talk about the high quality of our investment portfolio and I'll get back to that, but first, let me say a few words about our prudent management of that portfolio. The banking sector disruption started with an acceleration of liabilities in the form of withdrawals from demand deposit accounts. As we all know, there's no acceleration of our largest liabilities, loss reserves. In other words, there's no such thing as a run on the bank in our business. But the banking episode also highlighted the risk to the equity of an enterprise when the duration of assets and liabilities are mismatched. We manage the duration of our assets relative to our liabilities. Such as on an economic basis, we've effectively defused our insurance liabilities. In other words, increases or decreases in interest rates generally have offsetting impacts on the present value of both our investment portfolio and our outstanding insurance liabilities. This essentially boxes the economic impact of changes in interest rates. As we've explained in response to your questions over the years, this is a reason why we didn't reach for yield by increasing duration in the low interest rate environment over the past decade and a half. In addition to duration, the bank solvency issues also highlighted the importance of thoughtfully managing liquidity. Quarter in and quarter out, we've consistently generated strong cash flows from operations. Our cash flows from premiums alone over the course of the year are consistently greater than our annual payments for claims and expenses. That was true throughout the 2008 financial crisis and more recently throughout the pandemic. We also have a steady and reliable stream of cas"

We also have a steady and reliable stream of cash flows from our very high-quality fixed income portfolio. In addition to the periodic interest payments we receive on the bonds we hold, the proceeds from our maturing investment each month provide an additional source of liquidity. Back to the high quality of our investment portfolio, macroeconomic uncertainty reminds us of how important that is. And the quality of our holdings and our disciplined focus on risk adjusted returns distinguish us. Our fixed income investments are highly diversified. They have an average credit rating of AA and comprise 93% of our investments. Our alternative investments are also high quality and well diversified. Page 20 of our webcast presentation includes further details. To address another topic that's been in the news lately, Page 21 of the webcast presentation includes information demonstrating the relatively nominal risk we have in our investment portfolio related to commercial real estate. Real estate represents a small percentage of our total invested assets. Our fixed income real estate investments are very high quality and the largest component of our non-fixed income real estate investments is wholly-owned properties. The wholly-owned properties are carried at their depreciated historical cost. In other words, they were never written up when market values were high, and the appraised value of the portfolio is well above book value. The portfolio has also produced a strong free cash flow yield. In short, whether we're talking about underwriting or investing, Travelers is built to manage through uncertain times. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share with you that we just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution partners who collectively represent more than half of our premium. We all left with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business leaders and their firms are as strong as ever, and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have underway. It's a great reminder that our position with distribution sets us apart and is an important competitive advantage that's hard to replicate. To sum things up, we're off to a great start for the year with another quarter of strong profitability and growth, driven by our underwriting and investment expertise. At the same time, we continue to successfully execute on our innovation strategy, which has contributed to significantly accelerated premium growth, superior returns and industry low volatility over the past decade. With the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success through a wide range of economic and operating environments, and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value overtime. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $970 million and core return on equity was 14.5%. Compared to the prior year, this year's first quarter results included a significantly higher level of catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. Those unfavorable items were largely offset by higher underlying underwriting income, including a one-time tax benefit. The tax benefit impacts the income tax line only, and thus, does not impact the combined ratio or the underlying combined ratio. Our first quarter results include $535 million of pre-tax cat losses, significantly higher than the prior year's benign results, and about $160 million above the average of our first quarter cat losses for the past five years. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $797 million was $131 million higher than the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an improved underlying combined ratio of 90.6%. Results were again very strong in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, while in Personal Insurance, we made significant progress in obtaining price increases that position us to get back to target returns. The first quarter expense ratio of 28.7% was again very strong. Our ongoing investments in strategic initiatives are balanced by our continued focus on productivity and efficiency and strong top-line growth, resulting in an expense ratio that, as expected, was broadly consistent with last year's first quarter and full year figures. We reported net favorable prior-year reserve development of $105 million pre-tax in the first quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $19 million pre-tax was driven by another quarter of favorable development in workers' comp, largely offset by an increase for umbrella liability coverages and environmental exposure in our run-off book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $58 million pre-tax was driven by better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance recorded $28 million pre-tax of net favorable PYD, driven by improvement in the homeowners' book. After-tax net investment income increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $557 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior-year quarter benefiting from both higher fixed income yields and higher level of invested assets. Returns in our non-fixed income portfolio remained positive, but were, as expected, less favorable than in last year's quarter. We are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, to $530 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $555 million in the third quarter and then to around $575 million in the fourth quarter. Remember, only about 10% of the portfolio turns over each year, so the higher new money rates will take a while to fully impact run rate NII. Regarding the tax line, this quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $211 million with respect to the repeal of internal revenue code section 847, which addressed the discounting of property casualty loss reserves. And as a reminder, last year's first quarter included a $47 million benefit from the favorable resolution of our most recent federal income tax audits. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates decreased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $4.9 billion after tax at year-end to $3.9 billion after tax at March 31. Remember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses did not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high, and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $116.55 at quarter-end, up 2% from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. We returned $680 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, including share repurchases of $462 million and dividends of $218 million. As Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.00 per share and also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases on top of the $1.6 billion remaining under the prior authorization. Let me wrap up my comments today on a personal note. A few weeks ago, we announced that on June 2, our friend and colleague Doug Russell, will retire after a 40-plus year career, about 25 of which have been with travelers. And for the past five years or so, Doug has held two very important roles, Corpora"

And in addition to being invaluable to me when I took over the Corporate CFO role, Doug has positioned us well for the future. We're fortunate to have two highly-capable long-time Travelers' employees ready to step in. Paul Munson will take over as Corporate Controller, and Larry Mills will take over as Treasurer. Thank you, Doug, for all that you have done for the success of our company as well as for the success of the finance professionals who've had the privilege of working for you and working with you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to deliver exceptional results, with a strong first quarter of 2023 in terms of both top- and bottom-line results. Segment income of $756 million was up 13% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher underlying underwriting income. In addition to higher earned premium and the lower underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting income also benefited from the segment share of the one-time tax benefit that Dan mentioned. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.6%, which was more than 2 points better than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by the loss ratio, which benefited from property losses that were lower than a somewhat elevated level in the prior-year quarter and the benefit of earned pricing. The expense ratio was a strong 29.8%, and continues to benefit from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums increased 15% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.2 billion, benefiting from historically high renewal premium change and retention, as well as record new business levels. As you heard from Alan, the Fidelis quota share also contributed to the higher net written premiums. Turning to domestic production for the quarter, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.6%, with renewal rate change ticking up sequentially to 4.7% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention of 87% also remained exceptional, while new business was up 17% from the first quarter of last year to a record high of $639 million. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. Lastly, we are particularly pleased that our ongoing focus on our strategic investments help us drive an increased flow of new business opportunities. And we capitalized on those opportunities by being more responsive in quoting and converting on more quality accounts during the quarter. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 10%, while retention increased [a point] to an exceptional 84%. New business increased 16% from the prior-year quarter to $129 million, driven particularly by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change was 8.1%, with renewal rate change increasing sequentially to 4.4%, while exposure growth was once again strong at 4.1%. Retention remained exceptional at 89% and new business was up 19% from the prior-year quarter with increases across all account sizes in most markets. As I mentioned a moment ago, we're pleased with the impact that our focus on strategic initiatives is having on our production results. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with a great quarter on both the top- and bottom-lines. Segment income of $207 million was slightly lower than the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax income improved slightly as higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income were mostly offset by losses related to disruption in the banking sector. A lower favorable income tax adjustment in the current quarter more than offset this pre-tax improvement. The segment combined ratio was an excellent 80% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 86.1%, with the 3.9 points increase primarily driven by losses related to a few financial institutions and a higher expense ratio, partially offset by the benefit of earned pricing. Our quality risk selection and disciplined limits management continue to position us well to navigate through uncertain economic conditions. Turning to the top-line. Net written premiums were strong and consistent with our exceptional top-line in the prior-year quarter, which, as you might recall, grew by over 20%. In domestic management liability, considering our strong returns, we're very pleased that retention continued to be at a near-record 90%, a 5 points improvement from the prior-year quarter, and that renewal premium change was solid at 5%. We're also pleased that we increased new business 25% from the prior-year quarter. As Alan mentioned during his opening remarks, we're pleased to have driven a very strong and record level of first quarter surety net written premiums. So, both top- and bottom-line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, driven by excellent execution, benefits from our ongoing and strategic investments and the market-leading competitive advantages and franchise value that we offer our customers and distribution partners. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, first quarter segment income was $83 million. The combined ratio of 101.5% increased approximately 6 points from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher catastrophe losses, primarily related to the significant tornado and hail events in March. The underlying combined ratio of 92.9% was comparable to the prior year, as the benefit of earned pricing across all products, lower losses in the homeowners and other product line and a lower expense ratio were offset by elevated losses in the automobile product line. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 12%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 104.7% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.4%. The underlying combined ratio increased 4.6 points from the prior year due to increased vehicle replacement and repair costs, higher bodily injury severity and, to a lesser extent, higher frequency. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing as well as a lower expense ratio. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5% increased 7.3 points, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.7% improved 4.2 points, reflecting lower losses associated with mild winter temperatures in the Eastern and Central United States, as well as the benefit of earned pricing "

These benefits were partially offset by elevated loss severity from continued labor and materials price increases. As a reminder, for homeowners, we expect the upcoming second quarter to be the seasonally highest quarter for weather-related losses. Turning to production. Our results demonstrate the impact of rate and non-rate actions in both lines, as we seek to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 13.9% increased 2.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect renewal premium change to be modestly higher than this level throughout the remainder of 2023. We've shared previously that we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states, representing the majority of our premium by mid-year. While the loss environment is incrementally more challenging, we are adjusting our pricing plan accordingly and still expect to get there or very close to it. We will continue to pursue rate increases necessary to deliver target returns and the benefits of this increased pricing will earn into our results over time. As we've taken significant pricing actions, retention and growth in auto have continued to moderate as expected. Policies in force declined 1% from year-end 2022. In domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 20.2% increased approximately 6 points from the fourth quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain at this elevated level through the end of the year. In the face of these increases, retention declined but remained strong, new business written premiums were in line compared to the prior-year quarter, and policies in force remained consistent relative to year-end 2022. In Personal Insurance, we entered the year with continued focus on disciplined marketplace execution in response to a loss environment that remains challenging. In addition to making more progress in pricing, we continue to implement non-rate actions. Examples include tighter underwriting in both auto and home, and improved pricing segmentation and risk selection in property. We're encouraged by the progress we're making towards our goal of achieving target returns. While we have more work to do, we are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now, I will turn the call back to Alan.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThanks, Michael. I'd like to add to Dan's recognition of Doug Russell. I met Doug in 2022 during Travelers' IPO. He's been a great friend and a source of endless expertise and insight ever sense. Doug, we thank you and we'll miss you around this table in particular, and thanks for leaving us in such good hands. Abbe, back to you.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks, Alan. Okay, we are ready to open up for your questions."

Your line is open.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nWell, good morning, everyone. And I guess where I'd like to start off is on the top-line growth in the Business Insurance, the 15%. I'm looking at Slide 8 of your presentation. Can you provide some color on the various lines that are going up? I was intrigued by national property. And then, the geography of Fidelis, is that an international? And when I think about property, can you talk about where the growth is coming from in the context of what we're seeing in reinsurance costs?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nGood morning, Greg. Yeah, this is Greg. First of all, I'll take the national property one. Yeah, clearly, we shared with you in the fourth quarter that post some of the severe weather activity in the fourth quarter, we did expect a hardening of the reinsurance market, and we are going to be in such a good position given our gross line underwriting mentality. And I think that's what's playing out ultimately in some of the growth in national property. It is mostly driven by renewal premium change, although we are getting the opportunistic looks at new business, but most of that growth really is coming through pricing. In terms of Fidelis, I mean, Alan made his comments. If you look at the webcast, you can see the domestic production up 11%. So, when you look at all the businesses from select to national property, again, double-digit growth, and we're feeling terrific about that growth. And similar to national property, most of that growth is coming through price increases. But again, some thoughtful new business, adding quality accounts to the portfolio has been in addition to the pricing.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGreat. And then, my follow-up question, just pivoting to inflation assumptions. If we're watching CPI data, it still seems like there's inflationary pressures. And maybe, Alan, you can give us your view of how you think inflation is going to affect your loss cost assumptions for the current accident year?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Greg. I guess I would say that we're pretty confident that in our loss picks, we're contemplating everything that is going on that could impact loss cost, and that includes inflation. And we're only trying to predict out as far as the duration of the liabilities. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the picks. We're certainly seeing inflation. You see it more prominently in Personal Insurance where you've got shorter tail lines and more of the loss cost impacted by things like materials cost and labor, and you see it relatively less in our commercial lines, because just -- that's just a lower portion of the loss cost. But I guess that's what I'd say, Greg.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

And sorry to be harping on the negative, but umbrella liability was called out as one of the reasons and the environmental reserve addition looks like it was lower year-over-year looking at the Q. So, just any comments there?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nWhat's -- Mike, what's the question? I've -- we heard are commentary...\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nSorry. Curious about what Greg meant about the persistent environmental headwinds. Are you speaking to inflation picking up a bit or kind of staying kind of at levels that are a bit above historical trend?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nMike, I'll turn it back to Greg if I miss anything here, but there's -- I think there's nothing new in that comment. It's reinsurance pricing, it's economic inflation, it's tight labor market, it's weather frequency and severity and so on. But it's a continuation of trends we've been facing for some time.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nMike, the only thing I'd just add and I think that's what's driving the renewal premium change of close to 10% and ultimately the combined ratio of sub-94% and an underlying of sub-90%. So, I feel like given those headwinds, we're operating very well in terms of relationship to them.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nOkay, great. Last question just on personal lines. Clearly, good momentum on the pricing side, clear about your comments about rate adequacy in most states. But if we just look at the combined ratios, it -- in your comments, it looks like inflation is staying much higher for longer in both auto and home. I don't know if you'd agree with that or anything you want to call out or that maybe is getting better or one-time in nature. Thanks.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Mike. It's Michael. Yes, I would say, I would agree inflation is higher for longer continuing to put pressure on both lines. And I called that out as a driver of the continued deterioration in auto, and then a little bit of an offset to some of the improvement in property. So, we continue to face that persistent inflation pressure. The other thing just to be really clear on the comment about rate adequacy, right, that's a comment about written adequacy for business we're putting on the books, which is really a prospective view, and certainly the GAAP financials will lag that, because we need that rate to earn through before it shows up in the GAAP financials, which is why I've been consistently commenting that it will take time for those rate changes to earn through. But we do see continued momentum in pricing in both auto and home, and I'll give you a quick example. We were actually really pleased last Friday to get approval from the State of California for 19 points of rate in auto effective May 31st, which is one of the elements of that prospective view and one piece of the puzzle in terms of why we see renewal premium change going higher from here.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):"

No, we did not have an impact from the Florida lawsuit filings in our result, and that's largely due to the fact that the comment that you just made, our auto market share in Florida is about 2%. So, it's a relatively small exposure for us.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the commercial lines, I'm just curious, in Business Insurance, Fidelis coming in. I'm assuming it was relatively small from an earned premium perspective. But as we think about that continuing to earn in your Business Insurance results, is that going to have favorable impact on your underlying loss ratios here? Does it have a more property component maybe better underlying loss ratios?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Brian, it's Dan. I'll take that. So, look I think the short answer as we said at the end of the fourth quarter is it's just not going to be big enough to move the needle a lot. If it plays out the way that we hope it would play out, it would be -- it would have a very modest favorable impact to underlying combined ratio and business insurance. The first quarter, it's tiny, because the earned premium component of a partial earning is just not that big. And then, the only other thing I'll throw out there as a reminder since you mentioned the property book or any other business that they write, we do have a loss ratio cap on that quota share, so it can't really hurt us badly on the other side.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Thanks for taking the question. First one I had was on Business Insurance. When I listened to the comments about the year-over-year change in underlying loss ratios and so forth, one of the things I didn't hear was sort of the mix shift maybe a bit towards property or impact from the reinsurance changes that you made, a little higher retention, et cetera. I mean, is that because that was not really too material to that? Or can you provide any color on how that may have impacted year-over-year comparisons of loss ratios?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYeah, Alex, it's Dan. So, I think you're coming to the right conclusion. Not a big impact -- excuse me, or we would have called it out. Because a reminder, we did say even back in the fourth quarter when we went through what the 1.1 reinsurance renewals looked like and where our attachment points were and what the cost was and what treaties we renewed and what treaties we didn't renew that we didn't expect that to have a big impact on margins going forward and that proved to be the case. Mix does move over time. We gave you the written premium numbers by line of business, so you can see that. But not a driving factor in the year-over-year margin comparison.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. And then, maybe just in terms of the pricing, can you kind of unpack for us at all when we think about that modest reacceleration of renewal rate change? Can you help us think about what you're seeing among some of the different product lines?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAlex, let me just try to respond to that with some general comments about the pricing environment and you can follow-up if we don't get to the question. I would say the pricing environment remains very strong. We saw, as you saw, in the numbers a little acceleration in renewal rate that was led by property, umbrella and auto. And we'll just have to see whether that's the start of the trend in that direction or it's not. And very significantly when you were thinking about prices, we've said many times even with another quarter of very strong pricing, retentions remain at historical highs, which for us is terrific given the attractive return. So, in broad strokes, and I think Greg included this in his commentary, there are two trends impacting pricing. On the one hand, there are headwinds and we've been seeing those for a while now, and they're still there, and that's what you see us reacting to. And on the other hand, after years of some pretty good pricing and improvements in terms and conditions, [returns in] (ph) a better place. And so, the pricing that you see us putting up is what we're achieving is really threading that needle incredibly well. I mean, hats off to our field organization for just really superior execution.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

How efficiently are they handling current cases? Compared to where we were one, two, three years ago, where are we in that story?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey Josh, it's Dan. So, I'll take a shot at that. Look, I think we were saying two years ago, that even when courts did reopen that we expected that it was going to take quite a while for the backlog to work its way through. We thought that was going to be measured in years, not in quarters. I think the data that we look at every quarter would so far confirm that to be true. So, in some of the most recent, say, three and six month diagonals, the amount of claims that are closing in a three or six month period is a little higher than the historical pattern would tell you it would be. But when you put that on a life to date basis for those accident years, closure rates are still lagging where they were pre-pandemic. And so that's what we're seeing. You're starting to see some of that backlog work its way through, but again we think we've got a long way to go there.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd does the backlog mean that if I have a new incident in 2023, that it's going to be a extended period of time before it can see a courtroom?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nIt depends, Josh. It depends jurisdiction by jurisdiction, it depends by type of claim, it depends by complexity of claims. So, I wouldn't say that as a universal rule.

I really enjoyed the interactions in my prior role over many years. Hey, since the Boy Scouts' appeal by insurance did not go through, wondering, were you holding out on that appeal passing or do you feel good about the IBNR reserves you set aside? It would also be helpful if you could quantify how much IBNR you set aside for reviver cases in general.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Tracy. So, it's Dan. So, I'm not going to do the latter. You know from the way we've talked about reviver statutes, and those types of exposures going all the way back to the first quarter 2019 when New York implemented what for us was a pretty significant reviver statute. We're looking at what happened state-by-state quarter-by-quarter and reacting in real time as best we can. BSA is something that we and the whole industry has been watching for a long time. You generally don't see our name in the news in connection with that because we don't have anywhere near the exposures that some of the other folks have. We weren't necessarily going to be significantly swayed by bankruptcy proceeding or not proceeding one way or the other. We have all the information at our fingertips in terms of what's the latest and greatest, and that's what's baked into our reserves. In that regard, one thing I'll mention in case you were going to go there, in the month of April, the State of Maryland implemented a new reviver statute. It's not effective until October of '23, but because the law changed in the second quarter of '23, we'll do our assessment in the second quarter of '23. Too early to say with any certainty what that impact might be, but not expecting that to be a big deal for us at this point.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nThat's very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up question that Josh raised. I noticed in your 10-K, you've reported a lower number of -- cumulative number of reported claims. And I'm wondering when you set aside reserves if you think about a more normalized number of claims coming through considering the backlog in the court system?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nTracy, I think for the last few years, we've said given the backlog in the court system and the delay in closure rates, there was more uncertainty in the loss environment, and we were trying to make sure that we allowed for that uncertainty when establishing our loss picks.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nTo something north of the reported claim, correct?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nNo, we're not going to do frequency times severity. I'm just telling you that we'll recognize that there's a level of uncertainty in the environment and we're trying to factor that into our loss picks.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):"

Could you talk about some of the drivers of the improvement year-over-year and the sustainability of it going forward? And I'm specifically looking just for how much lower the non-cap property losses were this year versus the elevated level last year? And were they at a lower level than you would normally expect in a typical first quarter?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes. Hey, David. Dan again. So, look, so the underlying combined improved by a couple of points, almost a half a point of that you could see was expense ratio. So, you got about 1.5 point in the loss ratio. And Greg's comments were slightly elevated level of property losses in last year's number and the continued benefit of earned pricing, neither of those are huge to the probably more salient point of your question at the end. We look at this quarter and see it as pretty clean quarter in terms of a jump off point, not really anything that was significant one way or the other that we think you'd adjust out for.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. And then, just a question for Alan, just on the pricing environment and specifically for the property business. So, last quarter, I think you had said you saw property rate accelerate month-by-month in the quarter. Just wondering how that trended in the first quarter here. And just given property is a seasonally small part of the business in the first quarter, would you expect continued acceleration in renewal rate change in Business Insurance?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI mean, the first quarter property pricing was -- we saw a continuation of that trend through the first quarter. I think we're going to try not to forecast and line pricing is not much more competitively sensitive than our pricing strategy. But given the hardening of the reinsurance market, there's a fair amount of activity in the pricing space. There's, overall, probably a constraint in capacity, and I think underwriters are generally just reacting to the loss environment.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):"

In the context of there're some rumors that Progressive is [getting back] (ph) to digital marketing a lot. The implications, they saw something in March that made them nervous about the business, it's been confirmed. But is there anything in the data that you saw sort of inter-quarter, as we went through the quarter, particularly in auto that would suggest some sort of market change either in the loss ratio or maybe even the sort of marketing piece of the business? Obviously, the average looks what you'd expect. But just wondering if there's anything in that inter-quarter level that we should be -- that would stand out at all?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Paul, it's Michael. I would say probably nothing that would stand out. I will tell you that the first quarter in auto is one of the tougher quarters to try to diagnose trends in because of changes in weather, when the weather improves, when you get winter storms or not, the sort of frequency and severity results in auto in Q1, sort of inter-quarter, as you described, are sort of the toughest to discern trends from really of any quarter in the year. And then, as you look at the external indices, you see wholesale used car prices moving around. One consistent trend we see underneath everything is parts and labor costs continuing to rise. That's been fairly steady for a long time. And then, again, a lot of the items that I mentioned, just impact driving behavior very differently from one year to the next. So, I wouldn't say I see anything on the loss side that's worth pointing out from within the quarter. And then, if you think about more of the business dynamics, to your point about digital advertising, et cetera, we continue to see healthy demand for quotes in the marketplace. And I think there's a variety of drivers of that, probably the biggest of which is the rate that's going through the marketplace and through the industry driving people to shop. So, I don't know if that was one of the elements you were trying to get at. But certainly, we see pretty healthy quote activity, again, through the quarter, not a lot of inter-quarter variability.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nThat definitely helps me understand it better. And then, relatedly, I was just listening to your comments about personal line pricing. And maybe just a clarification, and I apologize if it's just me being confused. But it sounds like you're going to hit the expectations for guidance of rate adequacy on time. But was there an implication that essentially Travelers will have to kind of jack up the rates a little bit faster or a little bit higher than you previously expected because the underlying trends are a little bit worse? Or am I just not interpreting that correctly?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nNo, I think you're spot on, Paul. We have seen the loss experience be incrementally worse, frankly than it was and than we expected. And so, we have adjusted our rate plan for 2023 accordingly and are seeking more rate than we thought we would as we put the plan together for the year. And so that's -- but that is underneath the comment that I made about RPC going north from here for the balance of the year. So that expectation of where RPC is headed reflects both our original plans around rate and the additions that we're now seeking because the loss experience has been a little bit worse.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nGreat. I'll always appreciate the help very much. Thank you."

Good morning, Michael, this is Greg. First, I'd point to the top-line in select, plus 11%. And you can see on the webcast, a lot of that is being driven by a strong pricing environment with a 10% RPC. But you can also see below that, that we've got real strong new business. New business is up 16% over the prior year, and we've shared with you the success of our BOP 2.0 product. So that's driving a lot of the new business. So, the combination of new business and pricing is really driving that strong top-line growth. And we're feeling terrific about the profit profile of that business and continue to invest in it.\n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nSuper helpful. Thank you.

And then, for management liability, any -- not necessarily asking for an outlook, but any commentary on pricing trends?\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Michael, this is Jeff Klenk. So, relative to the financial institutions, we've got some exposures on some of the financial institutions that were prominent in the news in the first quarter. We booked some losses for those over and above what we have in our loss picks. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that's really the primary driver of the 3.9 points increase in the underlying combined ratio. And then, what was the second question?\n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nManagement liability pricing commentary?\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nI think we wouldn't really give a projection on pricing going forward. I would say that given the healthy returns that we have in our portfolio, feel really very good about the 5 points of RPC that we got, the 90 points of RPC and you know that we're growing our new business.

For this particular quarter, we do have a stronger weight in the select business, particularly of workers' comp. And so, given the continued negative rate environment that we're seeing broadly across the workers' comp industry, the select business felt that in the first quarter. But again, I'll point out the strong RPC overall at 10% exposure was really robust. And as we've shared with you before, there's a meaningful portion of that, that does behave like rate.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then, I guess, for Michael, I mean, we've seen modest sequential PIF declines in the past couple of quarters in home and auto, but nothing significant. How should we think about -- when you think about the rate that you've put through or you're planning to put through, are you feeling like we've probably seen kind of, I don't know, retention bottom or, I guess, anything on that? Like, are your clients kind of feeling the full impact of the type of rate that you put through yet?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. Thanks, Ryan. I would say that as we continue to push rate and renewal premium change through the portfolio, we would anticipate some continued pressure. Again, not our primary focus. We're not wringing our hands over PIF growth at the moment. Our primary focus really is on improving profitability and the actions we need to take there. But we wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of continued pressure on PIF as we continue to work to improve margins.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

So Meyer, I think we're making strategic investments to maintain and extend our competitive advantages, and so -- and to make sure that we're investing in our future success. The two biggest buckets on that would be people and technology. And I'd point out why we continue to deliver attractive returns. A little more color on what that investment is would really be to develop and extend our flow underwriting capabilities in what I'd say are these traditionally higher touch management liability and surety lines of business. And again, that's all in the context of a reported combined ratio of 80%.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess, there -- I'm sorry, Greg called out some reserve issues related to the BI segment's general liability.

I'll take the PYD question. I think just a different dynamic. Umbrella and we talked about it a little bit last quarter. You're writing excess coverages in an environment of inflation, whether it's both the combination of sort of CPI, headline-type inflation plus the fact that social inflation never went anywhere. What you've seen is some more items pierce into those higher layers. So, not directionally inconsistent with the way we would have thought about it, but the magnitude of it was different, and we're just trying to react to that as we see the data come in. Just a different dynamic in terms of the management liability exposures that exist in the BSI book. And it just hasn't had the same crossover.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. So that's a function of the book as opposed to the actual loss trend if I understand it correctly?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nI would say that's true, yes.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

And it's -- so '23 -- and '23, it's early in the year, we wouldn't have done anything to modify our pick at this point.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then, in terms of personal auto, obviously, recognizing right, it's been a pretty hard environment in terms of loss trend for everyone. I had thought if in previous years, right, Q1 has at times been seasonally the best quarter when just looking at underlying combined ratios. You guys, obviously, have rate going to the system but that needs to earn in and trends remained high. Would you expect that same seasonality to persist that the other quarters of the year would be weaker on an underlying basis relative to the Q1? Or how should we think about the dynamics within personal auto?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYeah, Elyse, it's Michael. I would say that we don't see anything that would cause us to change our view of seasonality in auto. And to your point, the biggest reason the combined ratio came down relative to fourth quarter of last year really is that seasonality. So, notwithstanding the year-over-year same-period-to-same-period deterioration, those seasonality trends still seem to be intact based on looking at this year's first quarter relative to last year's fourth quarter.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

We think it's great progress. And I think we're just going to wait and need to see how it plays out a little bit. It's been a pretty challenged market over a pretty long period of time, still competing against citizens. It's pricing at a subsidized level. The current reinsurance market doesn't help. So, I guess, I'd say we're going to watch it with great interest and continue to evaluate the opportunity, but we are very encouraged by what they've done in Florida.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay.

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey; CFO; and our three segment Presidents Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties, and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today In the face of an historic cat quarter, our top and bottom line results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our business model. This quarter, we reported strong underlying results and investment returns, as well as, net favorable prior-year reserve development, which were essentially offset by an historic level of industry-wide catastrophe losses. There were PCS designated catastrophe events taking place on 88 of the 91 days of the quarter. Despite pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion, we generated slightly positive core income for the quarter. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Pre-tax underlying underwriting income of $781 million for the quarter was up nearly 40% driven by record net earned premiums of $9.2 billion, and a consolidated underlying combined ratio, which improved 1.7 points to an excellent 91.1%. Earned premiums were higher in all three of our business segments. Underlying profitability in our Business Insurance segment was particularly strong. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points to an excellent 89.4%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was higher year-over-year, but at 87.8%, still generated a very attractive return. In our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved by 2 points, reflecting the actions we've taken to improve profitability. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $594 million after-tax for the quarter, reflecting stronger and reliable returns from our fixed-income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed-income portfolio. Given our confidence in the strength of our business, we returned $633 million of excess capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million of share repurchases. Turning to production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.3 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 18% to $5.2 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was a record-high at 12.8%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated 2.5 points sequentially to 7.2%. The renewal premium change we achieved this quarter was broad-based. RPC was double-digit or near double-digit in every line, other than workers' compensation, and it was higher sequentially in every line, including workers' compensation. Even with strong pricing retention, an important indicator of marketplace stability, remained very strong at 88%. New business increased 36% to $671 million, led by the property line. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, record net written premiums were about even with the prior-year quarter. Retention in our management liability business was an excellent 91%, and new business increased 11%. Surety net written premiums were also once again strong. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. The growth we're putting on the books is from geographies, products and distribution partners that we know well. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.2% in our Homeowners and Other business, and increased to a record high 16.1% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on what Travelers is doing in an important area for us, artificial intelligence. We subscribe to the view that over time the impact of AI across the economy is going to be profound, so is the opportunity for Travelers. With our performance transformed mindset and our disciplined framework for assessing our investment priorities, we've been focused for years on responsibly developing differentiating AI capabilities across our three innovation priorities, extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences for our customers, agents, brokers, and employees, and optimizing productivity and efficiency. Between our colleagues who are dedicated to AI specifically and others in enabling disciplines, we have a very significant number of our employees engaged on the objective of making sure that we're leading when it comes to AI. As we've shared before and as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, for some time, we've been steadily increasing our technology spend. This year, we'll spend more than $1.5 billion on technology. As this slide demonstrates, we've also been improving the strategic mix of our tech spend. That includes a meaningful increase in investments to develop require cutting-edge AI capabilities built on modern cloud technology. Importantly, we've done all that while significantly improving our expense ratio. In no small part, thanks to the success of our technology investments. The quantity and quality of data are key differentiators when it comes to AI. For more than a decade, we've been investing in datasets, data quality and data accessibility. Between submissions in our commercial businesses and quotes in PI, we intake millions of business opportunities each year. We also take and adjust and adjudicate millions of claims. As one of the largest risk control organizations in the industry, we provide risk mitigation to our commercial customers, completing more than 100,000 risk control consultations annually. We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions. Our dat"

We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions. Our data also include decades of curated institutional knowledge in the forms of policies, procedures, guidelines, forensic investigations and so on. All of that creates an excellent foundation for the next iteration of generative AI. In addition to our extensive proprietary data, we've been assembling actionable third-party data for years. In fact, we have more than 2,000 datasets from hundreds of third-parties. All-in, we believe that we have a significant and hard-to-replicate data advantage. Given the competitive advantages that will come from deploying AI across the insurance value chain and the expertise, resources and data required to get there, scale will increasingly be a differentiator in our industry, as well the ability to execute complex initiatives effectively and efficiently. Expertise, resources, data, scale and execution excellence, all favor Travelers. The potential use cases for AI in our industry are many and varied. We pursue very focused opportunities that are consistent with our innovation priorities and will create meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, all with an eye towards leveraging strategic capabilities across our organization. AI capabilities that we currently have in production span the spectrum from those driving efficiency through automation, to more advanced generative AI and large language models. More advanced models augment various aspects of our underwriting, claim handling, service delivery and other work. We use intelligent process automation broadly throughout our business to handle hundreds of routine workflows. Automation and AI have been meaningful drivers of our expense ratio improvement over the past seven years or so. The key success driver in insurance is segmenting risk as finely as possible, to achieve pricing that is accurately calibrated to the risk. Deep learning models have significantly improved our ability to classify it in segment risk in our flow businesses. For example, in Personal Insurance, we leverage proprietary AI and aerial imagery to assess roof and other site-related conditions at the parcel level. Parcel level risk assessment at scale was practically unimaginable to several years ago. And that type of information is very difficult to obtain from the insured with a reliable degree of accuracy. In our Select Accounts business, we estimate that AI has improved business classification, a critical underwriting input by more than 30%. In our Middle Market business, we've developed a suite of sophisticated AI models, which facilitate targeted cross-selling, supporting our effort to sell more products to more customers. We're also using AI to better understand our customers and their needs. So this improved customer segmentation, we can better align new product development and generate insights that improve the customer experience. Enhancing our industry-leading analytics using machine learning models to deliver sophisticated actuarial insights into loss cost trends and development, which improve our already strong pricing and product monitoring capabilities. On the most advanced end, we're leveraging generative AI in large language models, and we've been doing so for several years. For example, in our Bond & Specialty business, our proprietary large language models have processed hundreds of thousands of broker submissions as we work toward improving intake time from hours to minutes. This will improve our responsiveness to our customers and distribution partners, and contribute to our productivity. In our claim organization, our proprietary large language model ingest legal complaints filed against our insureds and then highlights key liability and coverage issues, assists in routing the cases to the best-suited defense counsel, and provides risk-related insights that can be incorporated back into our underwriting process. We've also developed and are piloting a Travelers claim knowledge assistant, a generative AI tool trained on many thousands of pages of proprietary technical source material that was previously only accessible to thousands of different documents. The model provides claim professionals with the ability to easily access accurate actionable information on technical and procedural claim matters, increasing speed, accuracy, and consistency in various workflows, including in interactions with our customers and distribution partners. So in terms of AI, we're investing with speed and strategic direction, consistent with our stated objective of delivering industry-leading returns. I've only shared some of what's in-flight, and the capabilities that we've developed are in various phases of adoption. The full impact of the capabilities we're developing, and others on our roadmap are still ahead of us. To sum things up, we are very confident in the outlook for our business. We have terrific underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, improving underlying results in our personal insurance business, and steadily rising investment returns in our fixed-income portfolio. As you've heard, we're also investing in impactful new capabilities to advance our ambitious innovation agenda. With that momentum and the best talent in the industry, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter, and an underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, a 170-basis point improvement from last year's strong results. This led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $615 million after-tax, up $171 million or 39% from the prior-year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter improved 40 basis points from last year to 28.6%, once again, benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, our second largest ever cat amount for a second quarter. As disclosed in the significant events table and our 10-Q, we had six events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, the most ever for a single quarter since we began disclosing the table in 2013. Turning to prior-year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $60 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $101 million was the result of better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp across a number of accident years being more than offset by an increase in some of our other casualty reserves, as well as, for run-off operations. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $119 million was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal Insurance at $42 million of net favorable PYD, driven by Homeowners and Other. After-tax net investment income of $594 million was in line with the prior-year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields, and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed-income portfolio were solid, but as expected, we're not as strong as the double-digit yield we experienced in the prior-year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million after tax for the back half of the year. We now expect approximately $570 million after tax in the third quarter and $595 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30th are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the por"

New money rates as of June 30th are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the portfolio, so fixed income NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. In late May, we issued $750 million of 30-year debt in order to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio in line with our target range as our premium volume has continued to grow. Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.9 billion after tax at March 31st to $4.6 billion after tax at June 30th. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed-income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed-income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.45 at quarter-end, up 1% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $633 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million. We have approximately $6.2 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Since the significant level of cat losses in late June resulted in lower earnings for the quarter than we had anticipated, we expect the level of share repurchases over the back half of the year to be lower than the level of share repurchases in the first half of the year. Turning to the topic of reinsurance, Page 20 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1st reinsurance placements. While we did see some meaningful price increases on our reinsurance renewals, those increases were broadly in line with the price increases we are obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's little or no impact expected on margins. We take another moment to highlight a few items on Page 20. First, we renewed our main cat reinsurance program at terms that were generally consistent with the expiring program. Second, we increased the coverage under our Northeast Property treaty by fully placing the $850 million layer above the attachment point of $2.5 billion. A year ago, we placed $750 million of that $850 million layer and the attachment point was $2.25 billion. This treaty remains pretty far out on the tail for us. Finally, as part of our ongoing management of tail risk exposure for the enterprise and in response to inflation-driven growth in insured values in our Personal Insurance property book, we added a new hurricane cat excess of loss reinsurance program, specific to Personal Insurance coastal exposure, providing 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1.75 billion, again far out on the tail. Any margin impact from this new program will be de minimis, given both the size of our PI property book and the level of price increases we are obtaining on that book. To sum up the quarter, our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pre-tax cat losses and still report slightly positive core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our franchise, and the underlying fundamentals of our business. Q2 was another quarter of double-digit premium growth, improved underlying profitability, and further improvement in our outlook for fixed-income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $402 million of segment income for the second quarter, down from the prior-year quarter, driven by prior-year reserve development and higher cats, as Dan mentioned. Underlying underwriting results continue to be exceptional, with the underlying underwriting income up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.4%, which improved by three points from the prior-year quarter. The loss ratio benefited from property losses that were about a 1.5 points better than our expectations for the current year quarter. The loss ratio also improved due to earned pricing. The expense ratio remained strong at 30.1%. Net written premiums increased 18% to a quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by renewal premium change of 12.8%, retention of 88% and new business of $671 million, all record highs. Underneath RPC, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the first quarter by 2.5 points to 7.2%. We're thrilled with these production results and the superior execution by our field team in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased with our response to the persistent environmental headwinds in both the property and liability lines. In each of our product lines, renewal premium change was higher than the first quarter. And beyond pricing, we continue to improve terms and conditions to ensure we're achieving an appropriate risk-reward trade-off on the business we write. As we always say, we execute in a granular manner, deal-by-deal, class-by-class. Into that point, we're thrilled with our execution. Demonstrated by record retention of 88% on our very-high quality book of business and rate that is thoughtfully segmented by return profile. New business, as a percentage of the book, returned to pre-pandemic levels, led by the property line. We're pleased with new business dollars at an all-time high. And as always, when it comes to new business, we remain focused on risk selection, underwriting terms and conditions, and pricing. We're also very pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was up 1 point from the first quarter to a strong 10.6%, while retention also remained historically high at 84%. New business increased $30 million or 28% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was up more than 2 points sequentially from the first quarter to a historically high 10.5% with renewal rate change increasing sequentially by 1.5 point to 5.9% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention was once again exceptional at 90%, while new business was up 32% from the prior-year quarter, with increases across all account sizes in most markets. To sum up, Business Insurance had another strong quarter and continued to execute on the fundamentals to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted strong top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income of $230 million was up slightly from the very strong prior-year quarter. The combined ratio was a terrific 77.1%. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 87.8% for the quarter. A small number of surety losses drove the roughly 4 point increase in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year. As we've said before, surety losses can be a bit lumpy. Even with the incremental losses this quarter, our returns in the surety line remain excellent. Turning to the top line, we delivered record net written premiums this quarter. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that we drove record retention of 91%"

This result reflects our team's deliberate execution to retain our high-quality book of business in light of the very strong returns. We're also pleased that we increased new business 11% from the prior-year quarter. That's a reflection of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, and a lot of hard work by our team in the field. Additionally, we are pleased to report record surety net written premiums in the quarter. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were once again strong this quarter driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments to extend our market-leading competitive advantages. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone In Personal Insurance, the second quarter segment loss of $538 million and a combined ratio of 122% were significantly impacted by catastrophes. While it's not unusual for us to have a loss in the second quarter given it's typically the quarter with the highest weather-related losses, catastrophe losses this quarter for both us and the industry were significantly elevated compared to historical results. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both Domestic Automobile and Homeowners and Other. The underlying combined ratio of 94.1% improved 2 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an improvement in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners and Other, partially offset by an increase in Automobile. In Automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 108.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.5%. The underlying combined ratio increased 1.7 points from the prior-year quarter due to higher severity, driven by increased vehicle replacement and repair costs and a mix-shift from collision-only claims for its claims with bodily injury and third-party property damage, which is more consistent with more cars on the road leading to more multi-car accidents. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio. While some of the inflationary pressures in auto are beginning to show signs of easing, they are not improving at the rate we expected. Consequently, we're not yet achieving the written rate adequacy levels, we had anticipated. While we continue to make progress and expect to get there in the coming quarters, exactly when will depend on a few things. For example, how quickly inflation comes down, how quickly we can get additional rate through the regulatory process and our actual loss experience. In Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 135.1%, increased 17.1 points, due to significantly higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.2% improved 5.1 points, primarily driven by non-cat weather losses that were lower than in the prior-year quarter. Non-cat weather losses in the quarter were also better than our expectation, as more events reached our catastrophe threshold. Turning to production, our results continue to demonstrate disciplined market execution of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we remain focused on improving profitability and managing growth in response to continued inflationary pressures in the environment. In Domestic Automobile, renewal premium change of 16.1% increased 2.1 points from the first quarter of 2023. We expect renewal premium change to continue to increase from current levels throughout the second half of this year. In Domestic Homeowners and Other, renewal premium change of 19.2% was broadly consistent with the first quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the high-teens through the end of the year. Before I conclude, I just want to take a minute to thank our claim partners for responding to our customers when it matters most. Behind the aggregate statistics of catastrophe events occurring virtually every day of the quarter, our tens of thousands of individual customers whose homes and vehicles are damaged or destroyed and whose lives are disrupted. In each case, our claim team is responding, helping those customers get their homes repaired and their cars back on the road, continuing to deliver high-quality customer service despite the high volume of clients. Both the loss environment and the personal insurance marketplace remain dynamic. We continue to respond to the changing environment with a steadfast focus on execution quickly addressing changes in loss experience with targeted pricing, underwriting and other non-rate actions, remaining disciplined in writing business that is consistent with our appetite and making thoughtful and impactful investments for the future. We're confident that the actions we've taken and we'll continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now, I will turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nWell, good morning, everyone. I guess, notwithstanding on Michael's comments, I - just curious about if there's going to be any shift in the strategy on property considering what's going on with catastrophe losses. And I'm also trying to triangulate or bridge the difference between personal lines, which clearly was a negative surprise, and I think, Greg, in your comments you said property actually was a better net gain for you guys relative to expectations. So any broad comments on your views on property in light of the cats and in the different segments too, please?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. So I can start on the property side, Greg. Certainly, the catastrophe experience in the quarter was significantly worse than prior year and n worse than our expectations. In terms of our shift in strategy, what I would say is we continue to execute a series of actions in the property line to manage growth and improve profitability. And again, first and foremost, you see that in the pricing and the production statistics that we shared with you on the webcast. But beyond that, we're managing terms and conditions, think deductibles, think roof age eligibility, think coverage levels on roof replacement, and a variety of actions that we look at very granularly state by state, market by market, account by account. And then one of the other things we're really encouraged by, Alan had mentioned in his discussion around artificial intelligence, is our aerial imagery and artificial intelligence-enabled capability we have there to refine our underwriting and our risk selection. So less the shift in strategy and more a continuation of a really broad array of profit management and profit improvement efforts in the personal lines property space.\n\nGregToczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nHi, Greg. This is Greg. Just to follow-up on the commercial side, and so many times the catastrophes - the split between personal and commercial can be - really depends on the concentration of where the catastrophes hit in terms of where commercial businesses are. In terms of your comment, I think you referenced in my prepared comments, when I was explaining the underlying combined ratio, and I mentioned that property was better than expectation, and that really was non-cat property.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGot it. All right. Thank you for the answers. And then, I guess, I'll pivot, Greg, also during your comments, you talked about reserve development. Maybe spend a minute - don't really touch upon workers' comp, but the adverse development in the other lines.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHi, Greg, it's Dan Frey. I'll take the PYD comments. So in the quarter for Business Insurance, as we said, overall unfavorable $101 million. Comp continues to be favorable. The comp favorable was very strong this quarter, more than $250 million of good news. So that leaves us with the other liability lines including run-off being unfavorable. And that's really led by umbrella, which is sort of the poster child for perpetual core levels of inflation just compounding and pushing more claims up into the umbrella layer. But a couple of things to put - to put that in context, I guess, we're making a relatively small adjustment to those liability lines, given the fact that there are more than $15 billion worth of reserves in those lines. The returns in BI continue to remain excellent. And across the company, I'd just remind us, including the good news coming out of Bond & Specialty, which is also liability type coverage, we had a net favorable of $60 million for the quarter.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

So I'd be interested in how you've changed your 5.5% to 6% loss trend assumptions.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, David, good morning. It's Alan. Thank you. Two things in response to that. One, I would say that - I would just point you to the combined ratio and underlying combined in BI in the quarter, and obviously, we think about how prior-year development influences that through - base your changes and you can see a pretty solid results. And as we've shared with you before, I always - I always want to just preface this by saying, it's a very blunt instrument to try to capture what's going on across billions of dollars of premiums in a single loss trend metric. Every line has its own dynamics, and the question usually comes in, in terms of loss trend, but, of course, there is base year changes, there's exposure changes, there's other adjustments to loss activity. So always puts and takes in all those - in all those measures. But all-in, I'd say there really hasn't been much significant change. And I would go back to a comment that Dan made, on $15-odd billion of reserves, this is a relatively small adjustment. And we're always every quarter looking at all our reserves, and sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down, but relatively small. And as Dan said, the returns in BI continue to be exceptional.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Thanks. And then I guess, I should just take that. I mean, it's obviously a very fluid environment. But I guess, it would - fluid macroenvironment. It would seem that just given the re-acceleration in renewal rate change, the gap between written rate and loss trend has been expanding. I guess, is that the right take? Or is there anything else that I'm missing there? Obviously, we have to take catastrophes into account, but there - I know Fidelis has come in. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I'm missing on the underlying loss ratio.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nNo, I mean other than - Greg mentioned in the script that the non - the non-cat property losses came in a little better than we thought. But for the most part, I think the way you slice it up is about right.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes. And David, it's Dan. I'll just - you mentioned Fidelis, I mean, we said at the beginning of the year that Fidelis was not going to be big enough to have a meaningful impact on the underlying combined ratio, and that's still the case including Q2.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI think you got it right, David.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

So, yes, Alan, I hear you that you've got $15 billion reserves, sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down. But I guess, I'd say, they don't usually go up quite as much in a given quarter, especially when there is so much workers' comp reserve releases, and I mean, there's also like a pretty sharp acceleration of pricing. So it does look from the outside like - I don't know maybe you guys are seeing something new or you've identified something from a trend perspective. I guess, just if anything, in this review, I guess, what have you learned this year that, I guess, you might not have known a year ago?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nLet me start, Ryan, and I will turn it over to Dan. But we're squaring triangles, and we're doing - we're applying actuarial analytics to a series of triangles and historical losses, and that's really how we're coming up with this. I mean, the overwhelming thing that all of us are looking at is higher levels of economic inflation. And so that - you know, that is no doubt a contributor here.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Ryan. The only thing, I think, I'd add to Alan's comments, which I agree with. We've said, as people have asked over the last several quarters and pricing has continued to be strong for quite a while now, is that sustainable? And here you see it ticking up and I think we just keep going through the litany of pricing is going to be a reaction to what's your - what's your return target and what's happening in the loss environment. So we talk about continued increased frequency and severity of weather losses and you see that certainly this quarter, headline inflation, social inflation, that we said never went - never went away, and an uncertain overall macro environment. So those things continue to factor into our pricing. Those things also get evaluated every quarter and every year in terms of our view of loss trend in prior-year reserve development. So what you're seeing here again across the place, net favorable prior-year reserve development, I get the focus on the liability lines so - but really what you're seeing there is a degree of difference as opposed to some surprise. We've been talking about inflation for a long time and we were the first people to be talking about social inflation and never thought that went anywhere. So directionally, it's not a surprise. It's just an adjustment to the order of magnitude.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then for Michael, and maybe Greg, I guess, on the cat front, I mean, you guys were highlighting a frequency of events. But it seems like to me that severity must be at least as bigger of a contributor. Then maybe I'll just talk about - yes, in other words, I don't think I would have ever expected $1 billion of personalized with 6 Bcf] events. So from a severity perspective, like how - what's weighing on is here? Is it like the size of the hail, in other words, like the nature of the weather? Or how much of is elevated repair cost, demand surge like that type of thing?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nHi, Ryan, it's Michael. Yes, all of that. So I think your point is a good one. So if you look at the quarter, I think the number of events, PCS designated events was 19, that is above the long-term average. So there is a frequency of events that's higher. And that's a relatively high number for Q2. But actually, the majority of it really is severity. Now, some of that severity, to your point, is the underlying weather activity itself. I think on average, the events in this second quarter impacted about eight states apiece as opposed to six states apiece, so they were a little broader and more all-encompassing. And then again, historical averages. So you've got the number of events and then the size and magnitude. There certainly are anecdotal total evidence of more severe larger hail, those types of things. But the other item that you mentioned, it really is as big, if not a bigger factor than sort of the frequency and the magnitude of the events, and that's just insured values and cost to repair and the severity pressures that we've been talking about across both auto and property and frankly any first-party coverages that we offer as an organization really exacerbating that. So I think it's - I think it's all of those things, but it's at least as much a severity issue, and at least as much driven by economic inflation as it is the weather activity itself.\n\nGregToczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nAnd Brian, from a Business Insurance or a commercial point-of-view, we weren't immune from some of the same dynamics that Michael just articulated. I think we just have a broader array of products that you get a little more diversification when you add the workers' comp, the GL and all the other products on top of that."

I was hoping you could help us unpack it a little in terms of workers' comp versus maybe the other products. Certainly, the reserve development is sort of a good indication of how healthy things are on workers' comp, but pricing is down. I mean, is that a business line that's helping the underlying improvement year-over-year, or is it detracting from it? Could you kind of dimension that and help us think through some of the underlying drivers?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Alex. It's Dan. We're really - we don't do profitability by line. We're not going to go into that level of detail. You call out comp, it has been a good line for us. It continues to be - continues to be a good line for us, but really the way to think about BI is the blend of the products and that's the level at which we will talk about the underlying.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay. Second question I had is on pricing. There's, I'd say, more reacceleration in your pricing than we're hearing from, I guess, Marsh earlier today, and some of the barometers that are out there and so forth. Anything that's unique around the way you're approaching the market there? And could you help dimension it all, how much of that reacceleration of pricing is necessary for the reinsurance costs? You mentioned, it sounds like maybe loss cost trend hasn't moved that much. But help us think a little bit about how much of that can help you to tread water, first allow more underlying improvement?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, I think, we're going to try to stay away from forecasting margins, and I think, it may have been David who went to this question earlier, and just said renewal premium change is close to 13% and you're saying there's not a lot of movement in loss trend, it was - sort of should we take it on face value? I think, broadly the answer is yes. But really, I think what's going on here is there are some headwinds. There is - there - reinsurance costs are higher, inflation is higher, we're in a tight labor market, there's weather and so on So we're reacting to all those things. And on the other hand, after years of pretty good pricing returns, we're in a pretty good place. And so hats off to our field organization. They are threading that needle incredibly well. And returns are excellent, and we're pricing to continue to maintain and maybe even improve the returns."

That's not the only thing going on in there. As always, there are - there are pluses and minuses. We're trying to call out the main drivers for you, and those are - those are the two main drivers. If there was anything else of real significance, I think we do a pretty good job of trying to make sure we include that in the commentary.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my second question on - the ROCE improved a good amount sequentially. It sounds like that was broad-based in property and liability lines. I know this is obviously a bigger quarter for property in terms of business mix. I just want to get a sense of just confirm that I'm thinking about that right that it was more than just property that drove the improvement in ROCE. And how should we think about - any color you could just give in terms of that ROCE as we think about the Q3 and beyond?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAre you talking about renewal price change, Elyse, is that?\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nI was talking about the renewal rate, but - renewal rate - yes, in BI.\n\nGregToczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Elyse, you're right. I mean, clearly, we had a real strong quarter in terms of both rate and exposure in property. But we also had significant movement across the rest of the portfolio also, again, in both rate and exposure.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI'd say, at least, if you're asking whether it was broad-based or narrow, I think the answer to that it was broad-based."

It's Jeff. Thanks. I would say that we're watching inflation in materials and labor costs relative to construction. But honestly, really I think the prepared remarks really summed it up for you, right? We had a couple of losses that drove the underlying loss ratio change and ultimately this can be a lumpy line, and we feel really good about our market-leading surety book.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMaybe Higher interest rates matter also, I mean, when you get a big jump in financing costs, right, for contractors and stuff?\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. The credit availability for our contractors is absolutely an issue. We take that into account with our high credit quality book of business the way we underwrite this book. We got a high-quality book of contractors that we focus on there. And so your point is well taken. It's a part of the underwriting process. That's where I'd leave it. Thanks for the question.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nThanks, Jeff. And then, Mike, I'm just curious, can you talk a little bit about kind of the regulatory environment right now in personal lines? Obviously, some states are getting a little more content on rate, but are we seeing any push back kind of starting to emerge from certain states as far as the level of rate going through?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Brian, thanks for thanks for the question, and I think it's - I think it's a good observation. As we talk about pretty consistently, we feel pretty good about our relationships with the departments of insurance, are we really endeavored to make sure they have all the information necessary to evaluate and approve our rate increase requests? And starting with us, we continue to file for increases that align with our most recent experience and our indicated rate needs. That said, what we're seeing and you're seeing in the headlines, some news about increased scrutiny and/or states considering or proposing changes to the way that they regulate pricing in response to the continued period of increases necessary to keep up with loss costs. And so I'd say, on the margin, there is a couple of places where it's getting a little more challenging. But broadly speaking, we have still been able to file and get approved the rate we think we need in response to the increased costs.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

It's been an unusual three years in terms of interpreting loss cost trend with the courts being open and closed during COVID and very wildly changing conditions under loss trend. Is the data quality that you are looking at right now any less reliable in your mind than you think that normally is? are we in a state where extra caution needs to be placed on being comfortable with those numbers that you're using for reserving practices?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI would say the answer to that Josh is, yes. And I think we've said pretty consistently over the last few years that we have been cautious and reflecting that level of uncertainty into the way we think about loss cost and reserves. So I think the answer is yes, and we've been doing exactly that.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd then, I mean, look, we're all just throwing shelves from the cheap seats, a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about some of that, how you get more conservative or how you - in a time of uncertainty, how you get better or what you're doing in order to offset the risks associated around what's bad data and whatnot?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, it's probably a longer conversation, Josh. We can follow-up it. But let me just give you one example, and I think we've said this over the last couple of years. If you were just looking at the data, you might have assumed that some aspects of loss trend had improved over the last couple of years. And whether that's true in Personal Insurance, and you see the lack of negative PYD in personal auto, for example. Or if you look at social inflation, we said if the courts were closed, then that data could have been misinterpreted to mean things are getting better. You look at that data and you say, I don't believe it and we understand that it's distorted and that there are other things that could be impacting it. And so we are going to do the best we can to try to understand where the uncertainty is coming from and to make sure that we're - that we're reflecting our view of uncertainty as we're thinking about either our prior-year reserves or managing our current loss taxes."

Michael mentioned that the deceleration and claim cost inflation wasn't as strong as we anticipated. I thought you could give us some color on what - I guess, the indicators that you've previously used what they're suggesting for personal loss cost inflation for the back half of the year?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Meyer, I don't - I don't know that - that the external indicators that we look at are significantly different than the ones you look at or have - or do have available. What I can say is, auto severity has sort of remained stubbornly in the low-double-digits, and we had not anticipated that it would remain in double-digit territory for this long. I think the other thing I commented on in my prepared remarks was that we are seeing some signs of easing. The predominant thing, I'm talking about there is the Manheim Wholesale Index. And again, an update just came out this week on that, and I believe Manheim's estimate now is that used car prices will end 2023 below 2022 levels. But importantly, that's just one element of our loss cost, right? So wholesale car prices impact retail car prices, which impact our total loss settlement values, which is a portion of our loss cost. I think one of the reasons you continue to see double-digit pressure on severity is continued elevation in repair costs, labor, materials, et cetera. And then again, we've talked about just broad-based severity pressure. I think what we are seeing is some of the potential good news that we're starting to see in the physical damage coverages is being offset a little bit by this shift in mix to more claims with bodily injury and property damage and so on a mix - that mix impact impacts those loss costs as well. But again, the short answer is, we're still seeing low-double-digit trends in auto severity and we hadn't anticipated that they would last this long.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, perfect. That's helpful. And final question. When we look at, I guess, whether it's possibly changing weather patterns or the mix shift within BI slightly towards property or just inflation pushing more weather losses above the cat threshold, how do you think about sort of the magnitude of coming year's catastrophe load compared to where you've been recently?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI'm not sure we're quite ready to talk about that or to certainly give an outlook for that. Obviously, as we start to put our views together for 2024 and beyond, we'll think about the experience that we've had this year and in recent years, and other factors whether that's changes in exposure in our book or other things and we'll come up with a view that we hope will be sort of thoughtful and appropriate."

Is PFAS, a chemically - a chemical explicitly excluded from GL, like included in a pollution exclusion.

About PFAS, what I would say about that is, this issue has now been around for a while. What we know about it is, it is reflected in our reserves, and I'm not sure there's a lot more to say about it at this point.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nOkay. So you said, reflected in your reserves, so the adverse development you took in the quarter didn't reflect an update to PFAS.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nDidn't say that Tracy, but we're not going to really go into the drivers. We gave you the big drivers of the - of PYD, We're not going to go into the specific coverage issues in PYD."

Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2023 results.  We released our press release, financial statement--supplement, sorry, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer, and our three segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you Abbe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Core income of $454 million for the quarter benefited from very strong underlying underwriting results and net investment income, but was also impacted by elevated catastrophe losses and net unfavorable prior year reserve developments. Mike will provide more context on the catastrophe losses. The unfavorable prior year reserve development was driven by the results of our annual asbestos review in our run-off book. The reserves in the ongoing businesses of all three segments developed favorably.  We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Underlying underwriting income of $868 million pre-tax was up more than 40% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.7 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio which improved almost two points to an excellent 90.6%.  The underlying combined ratios in our commercial segments remained excellent. Our business insurance segment once again delivered very strong results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7%. The underlying combined ratio on our bond and specialty business was also excellent at 80.7%.  Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was 88.3% for the quarter, among our best ever. In our personal insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved more than five points to 94.2% as the strong written rate from prior quarters is earning in. Our underlying results in personal insurance are improving and heading in the right direction. Turning to investments, our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well, generating after-tax net investment income of $640 million, reflecting strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. In terms of production, thanks to great execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value they have to sell, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.5 billion. In business insurance, we grew net written premiums by 16% to $5.1 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was very strong at 12.9%, driven by renewal rate change which accelerated year-over-year and sequentially to 7.9%. Renewal rate change was higher sequentially in every line other than workers\u2019 comp, where overall renewal premium change remains positive and appropriate given return to the line. For the segment, even with higher pricing at record levels, retention remained very strong at 87%, a reflection of a rational market. New business was strong and higher broadly across the segment.  In bond and specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums to a record $1 billion, achieved 91% retention of our high quality management liability business, and grew net written premiums in our industry-leading surety business by 13%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.  In personal insurance, top line growth of 14% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.4% in our home owners and others business and increased to a record high 18.2% in our auto business. Another quarter of strong production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We\u2019ll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. With the end of the year in sight and 2024 on the horizon and coming into focus, we feel very well positioned for what\u2019s ahead and quite confident. In our business insurance segment, written margins are expanding. Pricing has been strong and the components of core goods inflation that impact our loss costs are moderating. Medical inflation in particular remains benign; nonetheless, given the duration of relevant liabilities, we continue to incorporate medical inflation in our loss costs based on the higher longer term trends. In terms of the top line in business insurance, we\u2019re pleased that economic output and consumption so far remain robust given our leading workers\u2019 compensation business, we benefit in particular from the near 50-year low in unemployment, the prime age labor participation rate, which is at its highest level since 2007, and ongoing wage inflation, which contributes to premium growth and margins. As a result of strong pricing in recent years and higher fixed income NII, returns to the segment are currently attractive; nonetheless, given the uncertainty generally in terms of weather volatility, economic and social inflation, a hardening reinsurance market and the geopolitical landscape, we plan to continue pursuing strong price increases in both the property and casualty lines to achieve our over time return objectives. Turning to our industry-leading bond and specialty business, we just reached a milestone $1 billion in net written premiums and returns are terrific. As you\u2019ve heard, results in our personal insurance business are headed in the right direction. Earned margins are improving and additional price increases will earn-in from here. We\u2019re very pleased with our targeted marketplace execution at the same time inflationary pressures are moderating.  In terms of the investment portfolio, with interest rates at their highest levels in recent memory and most indications suggesting higher for longer, we are extremely well positioned. In the last five years, we\u2019ve grown our very high quality investment portfolio by nearly $19 billion, or about 25% to more than $90"

I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to my 30,000 colleagues who show up every day committed to our culture, to our standard of excellence, and of fulfilling our mission of creating shareholder value and our purpose of taking care of the people we\u2019re privileged to serve. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $454 million and core return on equity was 6.9% as heavy cat activity impacted our results. We\u2019re pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6%, a 1.9 point improvement from last year\u2019s strong results. This combination of growth and underlying margin improvement led to a very strong underwriting gain of $684 million after tax, up $206 million or 43% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter improved 10 basis points from last year\u2019s quarter to an excellent 28% and continues to reflect the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. Our third quarter results include $850 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses resulting from another quarter of both frequency and severity of weather across North America.  Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net unfavorable development of $154 million pre-tax. In business insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $263 million was driven by charges in our run-off business, including $284 million related to our annual asbestos review as well as increased reserves for abuse and molestation resulting from the volume of claims related to the closing of the reviver window in California. This year\u2019s asbestos charge includes an additional increase to strengthen our carried reserve position relative to the range of outcomes. Outside of run-off in our ongoing businesses, business insurance had $132 million of net favorable PYD driven by favorability in workers\u2019 comp that was partially offset by unfavorability in commercial auto. In bond and specialty, net favorable PYD of $72 million was driven by another quarter of better than expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal insurance had $37 million of net favorable PYD driven by home owners and other. After tax net investment income of $640 million was up 27% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short term securities, to approximately $615 million after-tax for the fourth quarter. For 2024, we now expect more than $2.6 billion after-tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter of 2024 and growing to approximately $690 million for the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30 are about 180 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of more than $3 billion were an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion.  Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result our net unrealized investment loss increased from $4.6 billion after tax at June 30 to $6.5 billion after tax at September 30. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.  Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.78 at quarter end, up 2% from year end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $333 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6.1 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our board of directors. Similar to my comments on last quarter\u2019s call, the significant level of catastrophe losses we\u2019ve experienced this year have resulted in lower year-to-date earnings than we expected, so share repurchases in the fourth quarter will likely be lower than the quarterly share repurchases made in the first half of the year.  To sum things up, while our third quarter earnings were adversely impacted by elevated catastrophe losses, we\u2019re pleased to post another quarter of double-digit premium growth and improved and very strong underlying combined ratio, and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our business results going forward.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks Dan. Segment income for the third quarter was $468 million, with strong underlying underwriting and investment income, as well as favorable prior year development in our ongoing book offset by reserve charges in our run-off book mostly related to asbestos. We\u2019re particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 89.7% for the quarter, which was a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year and an all-time best third quarter result. The benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity, all in netting to an excellent result.  Net written premiums increased 16% to a record third quarter of $5.1 billion driven by very strong renewal premium change of 12.9%, historically high retention of 87%, and new business of $695 million. Underneath RPC, as you heard from Alan, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the second quarter to 7.9% with all lines other than workers\u2019 comp being higher. We\u2019re thrilled with these production results and our fields\u2019 continued superior execution in the marketplace, and given our high quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and the improvements in terms and conditions, we\u2019re very pleased to continue to prod"

Lastly, we\u2019re encouraged that new business was higher than the prior year quarter broadly across the segment. While the comparison of new business to the prior year quarter benefited from a relatively modest prior year result, as well as higher pricing on new business this year, we\u2019re also pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change remains strong at 10.3%, while retention of 85% was up two points from the prior year quarter. New business was up $46 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We\u2019re also encouraged with the early performance of our new state-of-the-art commercial auto product, which has been rolled out in 12 states. In middle markets, renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business was a strong $352 million. We\u2019re pleased with the quality of the submission flow from our distribution partners during the quarter and our responsiveness in quoting and closing accounts that aligned with our appetite. As always, we remain vigilant around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. To sum up, business insurance had another terrific quarter. We\u2019re pleased with our execution in driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long term profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks Greg. Bond and specialty posted terrific top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income was a record $265 million, up 10% from the very strong prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 80.7%. Turning to the top line, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered record net written premiums of over $1 billion. In domestic management liability, we again delivered record level retention of 91%, up two points from the third quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. This result reflects the attractive returns of our high quality book of business. Record surety net written premiums reflect strong broad-based demand for surety bonds and higher premium for large construction projects. We\u2019re pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits from our value-added approach and market leading competitive advantages.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks Jeff, and good morning everyone. In personal insurance, the third quarter segment loss of $193 million was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses. We experienced elevated losses from weather activity specifically related to wind and hail events. This was another active quarter for severe convective storms across the U.S. There were 19 designated PCS events specifically related to wind, hail and tornado activity in the quarter, nearly twice the 10-year average and the highest number for a third quarter in more than a decade. On a more positive note, the underlying combined ratio of 94.2% improved 5.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in both automobile and home owners. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 14%, driven by high teens renewal premium change in domestic automobile and home owners and other. In automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 103.5%. This was 8.7 points lower than the prior year quarter, which included catastrophe losses resulting from Hurricane Ian. The underlying combined ratio of 100.6% improved 3.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in our results clearly reflects the growing impact of our pricing and non-rate actions. Underlying results in auto are headed in the right direction as the benefit of earned pricing continues to accelerate and as vehicle repair and replacement trends are moderating. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2023, it\u2019s important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been six to seven points above the average for the first three quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving.  In home owners and other, the third quarter combined ratio of 116.2% increased 13.9 points due to the catastrophe losses that I mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 88% improved 6.9 points primarily due to the impact of earned pricing, a benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year, and a lower expense ratio.  Turning to production, our results continue to demonstrate our disciplined market execution in a challenging marketplace. Beginning with domestic, home owners and other, renewal premium change of 19.4% was very strong. The lack of growth in policies in force reflects our continued actions to further balance rate adequacy, catastrophe risk, and regulatory risk. We expect renewal premium change in home owners to remain consistent through year end. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect renewal premium change to remain elevated but moderate into low double digits as our automatic increase in limits factors return to more normal levels, in line with stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs.  In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 18.2% increased two points compared to the second quarter of 2023. Auto policies in force declined slightly, reflecting our continued efforts to manage growth while improving profitability. Going forward, we expect renewal premium change in auto to remain very strong but begin to move down from here, as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.  I\u2019m proud of the way our team continues to respond to the dynamic environment. We are consistently evolving pricing, segmentation, underwriting, and terms and conditions while managing new business flow to ensure we deploy capacity thoughtfully in the face of market dislocation. At the same time, we\u2019re sustaining our investments in capabilities to build our business for the future. With our leading talent, capabilities and strong distribution relationships, we are confident in our ability to generate leading returns over time. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks Michael, and Operator, we\u2019re ready to start questions."

I guess what I\u2019m--where I\u2019m going with this is just what is your longer term target with your UCR, especially in light of what we\u2019re seeing in the accelerating renewal rate trend, and maybe if you don\u2019t want to answer it that way, maybe you can triangulate for us just how the renewal rate change, which is accelerating, matches up with your inflation expectations and your insurance-to-value initiatives.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nA lot in that question, Greg - good morning, it\u2019s Alan. There\u2019s a lot in that question. I think you\u2019re right for starters - I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give you our targets or objectives. I think it gets too close to something that\u2019s competitively sensitive in terms of our pricing strategies, but I guess I\u2019d point you toward where renewal premium change is, which is at record levels, and frankly I always hate to get into the commentary on loss trend because, as I\u2019ve shared before, to take a single metric to define what\u2019s going on across billions of dollars of premium implies a level of precision that doesn\u2019t exist - every line has got its own dynamics, so on and so forth. But there wasn\u2019t a lot of change in the profile of loss activity this past quarter, so we continue to have a pretty meaningful gap between where renewal premium change is and where loss trends are, and so I think that gives you a sense. It\u2019s why we are--it\u2019s why we are--it\u2019s easy enough in my prepared remarks to share that written margins are expanding.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

Could we get the numbers there, and then are there any other lines in your ongoing business that moved materially in the quarter?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes Elyse, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll disappoint you there - we\u2019re not going to do the line by line, but comp has been pretty strongly favorable. It was pretty strongly favorable again this quarter. In our remarks, we tried to call out the lines that had noteworthy movement this quarter. Commercial auto did have some noteworthy movement, it wasn\u2019t dramatic particularly in the scope of if you think about the size of the reserves for the commercial auto book. What we saw in commercial auto this quarter is a little bit of a lengthening of the development patterns, not a terrifically new theme but every quarter, we\u2019re looking at all the data that comes in. This gave us an indication that maybe reserves should be carried a little higher than we were, and we\u2019re just trying to react to that in real time as quickly as possible. There was some movement in the other lines, some good guys and some bad guys, nothing particularly noteworthy, but those were the two main drivers.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then you guys--you know, you\u2019ve called out higher cats in the third quarter, as well as other quarters this year. As you guys contemplating making any changes to your reinsurance program heading into 2024, or how do you think changes you made over the past year could have led to higher cats this year?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nI don\u2019t think that the changes we\u2019ve made would have had much of a difference. Obviously the last few years, we\u2019ve had that underlying cat aggregate treaty. We didn\u2019t attach it at all in 2023, we didn\u2019t renew it in 2024.  We get that question a couple times - just to remind you, in 2023 when we had that underlying cat agg treaty, we placed--sorry, 2022, I\u2019m a year into the future already! So 2022, we didn\u2019t attach it, we didn\u2019t renew it in 2023. Even when we had it last time in \u201922, we placed about 50% of a $500 million layer, so it couldn\u2019t have been more than $250 million of recovery and it cost us a lot to have that policy - rate online was very high for that coverage.  We said at July 1 that we\u2019d enter into a new PI-specific coastal reinsurance treaty. I think we\u2019ll just continue to evaluate our position and what\u2019s available to us in the marketplace from a reinsurance perspective as we look forward to 2024, but I\u2019d say what we sort of regularly say, which is we\u2019re really pleased with our risk selection. We think we do a great job of segmentation and pricing. We\u2019re going to probably keep more net than many of our peers because at the end of the day, we like our underwriting."

First question, just for Michael, in terms of home owners, that clearly seems like a line that probably needs more rate, not less, just given where cat trends have been. But you mentioned in your prepared remarks that we might see some premium growth deceleration because of what you referred to as automatic increase in limits. It sounded like that might have been about half of renewal premium growth. Can you just, I guess mechanically, help us understand a little bit more what that increase in limits is tied to, and in the absence of that, what are some other means by which you can get more pricing on that line?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure Ryan, thanks for the question. Just unpacking it for a second, right, so inside RPC in home owners, there\u2019s really two primary components: there\u2019s rate and then there\u2019s exposure or other RPC, which primarily is the additional premium we collect due to the coverage A limit, the dwelling limit on the home going up. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve increased coverage A amounts significantly to keep up with higher replacement cost trends that have been occurring, sort of across the industry, and given those outsized increases in coverage A amounts over the last couple of years, as we take a look at our external data and information about where replacement costs are today and where trends are, we are largely caught up with that increase, and so we don\u2019t see a need for coverage A amounts to move dramatically north from here in the near term, so that premium that we would--that we have been collecting because coverage As have been rising, won\u2019t be nearly as big an element of renewal premium change in \u201924 as it was in \u201922 and \u201923. That said, to your point, clearly the home owners line continues to need rate, it continues to need profit improvement, and we will continue to seek higher rate in home owners even though the limit increases will be subsiding.  The other thing I\u2019d point is part of the answer in home is pricing. Another big piece of the answer is non-rate actions, and we\u2019ve been very active in the marketplace across risk selection, peril-by-peril pricing, tighter eligibility, stricter terms and conditions to drive profit improvement in the property line as well.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Then just a follow-up on business insurance retention - you know, it\u2019s interesting how robust that\u2019s been. Clearly we\u2019re seeing personal lines, retention come off as I would think you\u2019d expect when you\u2019re taking rate. What do you guys make of that, like why has retention been so robust, I guess despite so many rounds of rate increases?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nGood morning Ryan, this is Greg. I think we start every month with retaining our high quality book of business, so it\u2019s been very much an intentional strategy of ours to make sure that we\u2019re being thoughtful on our terms and conditions, our pricing, and all the changes that we\u2019re making to continuously improve margins, but given the quality of that book, it\u2019s not a surprise for us. It also is an indicator of just how rational the marketplace is right now and the need for improved margins across the entire industry, based on all those headwinds that Alan talked about. We\u2019re not surprised by it, we\u2019re very pleased with it, and we\u2019re very focused on it."

First, just had a question on commercial auto, and if you could just give us a little bit more insight into what\u2019s driving the adverse development there. Some of your peers have seen that as well, and I think there is some concern that this could be the beginning of a trend, given what\u2019s gone on in personal auto over the past two years or so.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey Jimmy, it\u2019s Dan again. Yes, as we said a little while ago, commercial auto is really just a modification based on the most recent data that\u2019s come in, in terms of the development of claims in commercial auto, particularly bodily injury claims. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve commented on and off probably over the last three or four quarters - numbers have been pretty modest, the themes are not inconsistent with what we anticipated, but you get a new set of data and the data looks a little bit different than your prior estimation, and so the magnitude of some of the changes that we anticipated is a little higher. Really, the focus of this most recent strengthening is the continued longer development of--or said inversely, the slower closing of claims in commercial auto, so as that continues to lag historical closure patterns, we\u2019re making an adjustment to reflect the most recent data.\n\nJimmy Bhullar - Analyst (JP Morgan):\nAnd that\u2019s just a function of repairs taking longer, or something else?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThis is more in the bodily injury side of commercial auto, so it\u2019s not so much repairs themselves, although that\u2019s been a factor in both Michael\u2019s business and, to a smaller degree, in Greg\u2019s business. Bodily injury, it\u2019s more the settlement of the injury claim.\n\nJimmy Bhullar - Analyst (JP Morgan):\nThen in personal auto, where are you in terms of rate adequacy on a written basis, and is--your discount has been sort of flattish, are your competitors being fairly rational and you\u2019re seeing price increases across the board or are there some companies that are not adjusting due to higher loss trend?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks Jimmy, it\u2019s Michael. I would say that when you look at our--taking the second part of the question first, when you look at our production statistics, retention is down a bit but it\u2019s actually been pretty resilient in the face of the rate we\u2019ve been driving through the book, particularly given the magnitude of those numbers. I think that that\u2019s indicative of a fairly rational market and the fact that these are again industry-wide pressures that most competitors are dealing with. In terms of written rate adequacy, again last quarter I said we\u2019d get there in the coming quarters. Relative to the comments last quarter, we feel a little bit better sitting here today than we did 90 days ago, given the record level of RPC that we achieved in the third quarter and the fact that we\u2019re seeing loss trends stabilize, and that\u2019s coming through in our underlying combined ratio.  That said, I would also say that written rate adequacy still depends on the same list of things we talked about last quarter, right - it\u2019s the price we get, it\u2019s how quickly loss trends moderate and how much they continue to moderate, the regulatory process for getting rate approvals, and our actual loss experience. But it is at this point very much a state-by-state conversation, and we\u2019re working each state individually and adjusting our actions accordingly."

Maybe you can quantify that and what\u2019s going on there with the management liability business that you\u2019re seeing this favorable development.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey Brian, it\u2019s Dan. I think we\u2019re not going to put a number on it. It\u2019s not a significant deal. The only point Jeff was trying to make was sort of when you do the comparison year-over-year, there was some favorable CYPQ, which we called out last year in the third quarter. There was some favorable CYPQ this year as well, just not as much, so the year-over-year is unfavorable given less of a good guy.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):\nGot you, okay. That\u2019s helpful.  The next question, I\u2019m just curious, bigger picture in business insurance, exposure growth continues to be pretty healthy. Maybe you can give us a little context around what kind of drives that exposure growth? I would think that with the economy moderating some here, that that exposure growth would start to slow here.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes Brian, we watch for that all the time, and as you can see in the webcast, in the blue lines we give you, you can see it\u2019s been very stable across the select business and the middle market, and obviously those add to the total BI business. It really is a function of nominal GDP - you know, economic growth and overall inflation levels, and clearly we\u2019ve seen the consumer-type inflation correct somewhat from the peak of mid-2022. Where we\u2019re really encouraged, when we also look at our audit premium which is more of a going backwards view in our core middle market business, we continue to have real strong audit premium also, so both backwards and forward, we\u2019re encouraged with how exposure is playing out in the business and we\u2019ll continue to report out what we see with that line."

I\u2019m just trying to--you know, does written margins mean--are you looking kind of forward-looking or backward-looking? Any color there? Thanks.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes Mike, it\u2019s Dan. Just to clarify for you, so when we\u2019re talking about margin in that context, we\u2019re talking about the underlying combined ratio, so leaving to the side catastrophe losses and leaving to the side prior year reserve development. The only other comment I\u2019d make in that regard is when we do see changes in prior year development, we do roll forward our thinking in terms of does that impact our view of current year loss and go-forward loss, but PYD itself as its booked, whether it\u2019s favorable or unfavorable, is outside of that context when we\u2019re talking about underlying margins.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, understood, and just a quick follow-up, then. Have you changed your view of forward-looking loss after this quarter, and you also called out the topping off of the asbestos and environmental--I think you used the word, topping off, but you kind of called out an additional add, and I don\u2019t know if you want to call out specifically what that dollar amount was. Thanks.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll split the asbestos charge beyond that, but what we wanted to get across was we did our sort of traditional deep dive in the third quarter, that resulted in a figure for which we would have strengthened the asbestos reserve. We chose also to, if you think about it in simple terms, as moving higher in the range of possible outcomes for asbestos, and so we\u2019ve put some money on top of what the analysis otherwise would have told you for the quarter. Then in terms of the first part of the question, we\u2019re looking at all the factors that go into loss trend every quarter, including favorable or unfavorable PYD. There are generally small puts and takes on a pretty regular basis, nothing terribly significant in this quarter in terms of our view of loss trend."

Maybe you can tie that into how you\u2019re viewing this line of business and your thoughts about that into 2024.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, good morning Yaron. I think you\u2019re referencing the slight down in the net written premium for the quarter. I would point you to year-to-date - it is just up 2%, so it wasn\u2019t a meaningful change for the particular quarter, and obviously where you\u2019re seeing not the level of net written premium growth on the other product lines that we\u2019re seeing in workers\u2019 comp, is clearly the rate pressure that the entire industry is seeing there. That rate pressure is driven based on the bureau\u2019s loss cost recommendations that continue to put minuses across the industry, and that\u2019s just an indication of the health of the line.  We\u2019re the largest workers\u2019 comp writer in the country, and on a calendar year basis we feel terrific about the results of that, and that\u2019s basically what\u2019s driving some of that net written premium change that you mentioned.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes Yaron, just to be clear, we feel great about the workers\u2019 comp line, we feel great about our results this quarter, this year, and we feel great about the outlook.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it, thank you. Then my second question, also on BI, did you have any CYPQ there, because I did notice that the underlying loss ratio was flat year-over-year. Just given the rate commentary and RPC commentary, I would have thought maybe we\u2019d see a little bit of improvement there.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes Yaron, it\u2019s Dan. A little earlier in the call and in Greg\u2019s comments, we called out that we did see some benefit from earned price, but half a dozen other things that would happen in any quarter, could be some good guys, could be some bad guys, could be mix, could be base year, could be non-cat weather, there were some favorable and some unfavorable that netted to a modest unfavorable to offset the pricing benefit, but nothing significant there."

I wanted to ask if you could help me think more about the cat load prospectively, and one of the things I was wondering about, and this may go to the definition of how you think about cat [indiscernible], is if inflation is effectively pushing losses that otherwise in the past would not have been cat losses, been in the cat designation, and that may be what--how much of that may be part of why the cat load may maybe go up. Just any thoughts on that would be great.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nSure Paul, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll start.  I think the second piece of the question, the answer would be yes to the degree that some of what we\u2019ve seen in higher cat losses is the impact of inflation over the last several years, and just the value of those claims going up. So yes, over time more things would fall into what would get designated as, quote-unquote, catastrophes, given the threshold.  Other than that, thinking about cats, we\u2019re looking at long term weather trends, medium term weather trends, near term weather trends. We\u2019re putting more weight on nearer term weather trends and, as both Greg and Michael have talked about, trying to react with very strong pricing, changes in terms and conditions, and risk selection where we think it\u2019s appropriate.  There is also clearly an uptick in catastrophe activity this year, so last year--I think last quarter, I think Alan maybe gave the statistic that in the 91 days of the quarter, there were 88 days in which there was a PCS event occurring. In the third quarter, there were 92 days in the quarter; on 91 of those 92 days, there was a PCS event occurring, so the increase in catastrophes is the combination of several factors: one is there do seem to be more storms more frequently; two, more people have moved into harm\u2019s way in terms of where the demographic spread of risk is; and three, inflation has resulted in the impact of those costs being higher. \n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nIs there any way to think about whether or not that would have an impact on the underlying combined ratio [indiscernible] the cat designation from the underlying?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYou know, Paul, sometimes we do see that in the quarter, where it\u2019s bucketing, where things will spill over into the cat number that would have otherwise been an underlying. That was not a big factor this quarter. It\u2019s not like there were a bunch of close calls that, because of inflation, spilled over into a cat designation. This was a significantly higher number of severe convective storms for a third quarter that created a bunch of catastrophes, so this was not a definitional bucketing close call issue. That does happen sometimes, but it didn\u2019t happen this quarter."

You know, in terms of CYPQ, not a significant amount. I mean, we called out the earned impact of pricing - that really is the driver of the improvement in underlying, and then as respects frequency and severity, frequency largely coming in, in line with expectations. If you look at external indices, miles driven is up 2% to 3%, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the trend it\u2019s been on, and so not a lot to talk about on the frequency side. Then really, the moderating trends that I described are really coming from severity as we continue to see in particular physical damage severity moderate quarter over quarter over quarter as we go through 2023.\n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nThanks, and then on commercial property, just wondering how should we think about the impact of the growth on PI margins, and if there\u2019s more volatility in non-cat property, might that affect your growth appetite next year?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nMike, it\u2019s Dan. I think we\u2019re very aware and cognizant of the amount of property that we\u2019re putting on the books, where we\u2019re putting it on the books, and what that\u2019s doing to our total exposures. We price property with a risk load, given the uncertainty and variability that can come with it. In terms of the margin from how much property you\u2019re writing, there can be a mix change over time if you think about the relative loss ratios of the lines, and some of that\u2019s driven by the duration of the liability in the lines. Property historically tends to run a lower underlying loss ratio than, for example, workers\u2019 comp, so you could get a mix change over time.  Tell me if that\u2019s not responsive to your question.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThe one thing I\u2019d add to that also is when you look at our property growth, the thrust of that growth really is being driven based on rate and exposure change. Clearly, we\u2019re being active and very selective on the new business front, but when you look at what\u2019s driving the net written premium change, it does start with rate and exposure change.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):"

We\u2019re really just reacting to--you know, we\u2019ve had this conversation before, you\u2019ve got to be really careful with your assumption around medical cost trend, given the duration of the liability. A quarter goes by, a bunch of claims close, you see what actually happened in terms of severity relative to what you had previously allowed for, and you make an adjustment. We\u2019re really just following the numbers in that regard. We\u2019ve certainly not become any more aggressive in the way we\u2019re reserving for workers\u2019 comp, it\u2019s just the mathematical output of the changes that we\u2019ve seen."

The follow-up I had is on the auto insurance specifically. You obviously showed a good amount of improvement, which is great to see. How much of that is driven by the severity beginning to calm down, or stabilizing at least? Any color you can provide on those trends, and maybe specifically even repair and what you\u2019re seeing there?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure Alex, it\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll just clarify a couple of things I said earlier.  It really is the acceleration of earned pricing, earning through and driving that underlying improvement. But when you think about the external trends and external costs, it definitely is also a result of those external trends moderating. We had been talking about double-digit loss cost trends particularly in the physical damage space for quarter upon quarter upon quarter. Those trends moved into the single digits this quarter, so it was really both the earned pricing and the moderating trends driving that improvement."

I\u2019ll share a couple of thoughts. First of all, the idea of regulatory reform in California is positive news. That said, I really don\u2019t think there are enough details available to evaluate. You\u2019ve got a framework that the governor has asked the commissioner to take action on, but the details underneath that framework and how it\u2019s going to be implemented have yet to be defined, and so deciding whether it\u2019s a net positive or not and what actions to take as a result, there just really aren\u2019t enough details yet to evaluate that further.

Thank you for the question. We would be really happy to take this offline with you. We\u2019ve talked really extensively about this over a long period of time, but broadly, the investments that we\u2019re making across the organization fall into three buckets: one, extending our lead in risk expertise; two, providing great experiences to our customers, agents, brokers and employees; and three, optimizing productivity and efficiency. That happens in a lot of different ways at the enterprise level and it happens segment by segment. At the enterprise, broadly speaking it\u2019s digitizing the value chain, digitizing the customer journey, modernizing the foundation, advanced analytics, automation, faster speed to market, getting the right price on the risk, things like that. In terms of what\u2019s going on in the businesses, it\u2019s partner integration, sales and service, better front end for customers. It\u2019s on and on. It is--it\u2019s focused and it\u2019s ambitious, but it also covers a lot of ground. We\u2019ve talked a lot about it extensively and we\u2019d be happy to meet with you and share more.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay, thank you for that. Maybe just a follow-up on worker\u2019s comp, and apologies for belaboring the point on this, is it possible to maybe unpack a little bit in terms of how the loss ratio looked like for workers\u2019 comp versus other parts of business insurance? I\u2019m assuming this does not impact your loss cost trend of 5.5% to 6%, but just curious if you can give a little bit of details there.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, we\u2019re not going to break out the losses by product line, but it certainly is wrapped in the overall number that we\u2019ve talked about historically.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay, thank you.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):"

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our fourth quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents; Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report exceptional top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income earnings per share and return on equity were all record highs, driven by both underwriting and investment results. Our underwriting gains were broad-based in each of our three segments underlying underwriting income was higher and prior year development was favorable. Catastrophe losses were also light. Record underlying underwriting income resulted from net earned premiums of $10 billion, up more than 13% over the prior year quarter and an underlying combined ratio, which improved 5.5 points to a record 85.9%. Looking at our two commercial segments together. The aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 85.9% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was coincidentally also 85.9%, an improvement of more than 10 points year-over-year. In addition, we are pleased to have delivered full year core income of $3.1 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.5%. Notwithstanding elevated industry wide catastrophe losses earlier in the year and a personal lines operating environment that while improving was difficult during the year. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after tax net investment income of $645 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our operating results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year, after making important investments in our business and returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to the topline. We grew net written premiums by 13% to $10 billion in the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $40 billion. All three segments contributed to our topline success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change remained high at 11.8%. Our retention also remained high at 87%. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a disciplined marketplace. The segment generated $672 million of new business in the quarter, which is a $118 million or about 20% higher than in the prior year quarter. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% to $989 million, driven by excellent production in our surety business, where net written premiums were up 9%. Production was also strong in our management liability business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in home and 16.7% in our auto business. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $2 billion of written premium in this segment over the past year. With another strong production -- with another year of strong production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to take a minute and put our 2023 results into an overtime context with an update to some data we shared previously. A half dozen or so years ago, we laid out a focused innovation strategy, ensure that if we were successful in this execution, we would expect to grow our business at attractive returns. A reflection of our belief that any strategy to achieve industry-leading returns over time requires a strategy to grow over time. The data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation show the success we've achieved. Starting at the top left corner. In terms of the top line, we've grown net written premiums at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past seven years, that's 2.5 times our rate of growth from 2012 to 2016. The growth rate in each of the past two years was double-digits, the result of a deliberate and tailored strategy, stronger pricing where we need it and a combination of pricing and unit growth where we like the opportunity. In Business Insurance, we've added more than $4 billion to our top line over the past two years. The investments we've made in capabilities to enhance the franchise value that we offer to our customers and distribution partners have contributed to strong retentions and growth in new business. In Bond & Specialty, we've increased net written premiums over that period by about $0.5 billion or 14%. More than half of that growth has come from a very profitable surety business, where our market leading position has enabled us to benefit from increased demand for bonds with higher contract values and projects resulting from the Federal Infrastructure and Jobs Act and other federal programs. Across both of our commercial segments, since 2021, we have about doubled our E&S writings to around $2.5 billion. That includes organic growth from the E&S business we write in National Property, our North field business and our Lloyd's business, as well as the impact of more recent strategic efforts, which include our relationships with Fidelis and Corvus. The margins in our E&S business are quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, where margins have not been at target levels in recent periods. Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over th"

Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over the past two years has been almost entirely a result of price increases. The PI team has done an excellent job of threading the needle, maintaining a strong customer base while achieving meaningful pricing gains. They've also done a great job with private product management. Our advanced peril-by-peril Quantum Auto 2.0 offering now represents more than 60% of the domestic property portfolio. And adoption of our telematics product and teledrive among new customers has been strong. With pricing gains and enhanced product sophistication, the book should contribute to our earnings power going forward as we move to our target returns. Also important is that across all three segments, we've grown mostly in products, classes of business and geographies and through distribution partners that we know well, that gives us a lot of confidence in the business we're adding to the books. Moving to the right, you can see that while we've meaningfully increased our rate of growth, we've maintained very strong and consistent underlying profitability. That demonstrates that we're not growing by underpricing the business or compromising our underwriting discipline. We've grown by investing in the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. We've also grown through a lot of great hustle and hard work on the part of our outstanding field organization. One of the clear strategic objectives of our innovation strategy has been to optimize productivity and efficiency. Moving to the top right of the slide, you can see that over the last seven years, we've reduced our expense ratio by 3.6 points to just over 28% for 2023, which is more than a 10% reduction relative to our 2012 to 2016 expense ratio of around 32%. Enhanced operating leverage gives us the flexibility to let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or invest further in our strategic priorities. Case in point, as you can see on Slide 21, since 2017, we have doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over a seven year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend, improve the strategic mix of that spend, and lowered our expense ratio. The upshot of what we've accomplished on the top half of Slide 19 is what you see on the bottom half. On the bottom left, you can see that we've increased underlying underwriting income significantly. From 2012 to 2019, underlying underwriting income averaged $1.3 billion. In 2020, we crossed the $2 billion mark and 2023 marks the first time that we've exceeded $3 billion. We've taken our underlying underwriting income to a meaningfully higher level. We've also significantly increased our cash flow from operations to more than $7.5 billion in 2023. The fourth consecutive year it's been more than $6 billion and more than double our average cash flow from operations in the earlier part of the last decade. Cash flow isn't a metric that we or our industry talk a lot about, but it's important. It's what gives us the ability to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. We've grown our investment portfolio significantly to nearly $93 billion. As we continue to reinvest our fixed income portfolio at higher rates, this is a highly reliable lever of earnings and value creation. To sum it up through a well-executed strategy, we've more than doubled our rate of growth, sustained strong underlying underwriting margins and meaningfully lowered our expense ratio. That has resulted in record levels of underlying underwriting income, cash flow and invested assets. Ultimately, of course, one number that brings everything together is adjusted book value per share. On Slide 20, you can see that we have steadily increased adjusted book value per share each year since 2006 at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. The effective management of our capital complements that result. We've increased our capital base to support the profitable growth of our business. At the same time, we've been disciplined about returning excess capital to shareholders. Over this period, we've increased our dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 8% and returned more than $40 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of about $74 per share. These results, together with our track record of strong returns and low volatility demonstrate the strength of our business and the success of our overtime strategy. Looking ahead, we're very confident about how we're positioned for 2024 and beyond. The fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. We're confident that we're focused on the right strategic priorities and that with demonstrated success in execution, there's plenty more opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, and core return on equity was 24%, both all-time record quarterly results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.5 point improvement from last year's quarter. The combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to underlying underwriting income of $1.1 billion after tax, up $511 million or 89% from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio improved from the prior year in all three segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter improved by 0.5 point from last year's quarter to 27.4%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. The full year expense ratio of 28.1% was our best ever. As Alan mentioned, our focus is on operating leverage. And looking ahead to 2024, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio in the range of 28% to 28.5% for now. Our fourth quarter results include a modest $125 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses with no individually significant events impacting our book of business. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $132 million pre-tax, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $56 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in umbrella and general liability. Even after the reserve charge, the returns in both umbrella and GL remain very attractive. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by better than expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $40 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After tax net investment income of $645 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2024, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $2.6 billion after tax, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter and growing to approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter.

      "raw_bytes": "out our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long standing CAT XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. And we've increased the amount of total coverage for 2024. Despite the growth in our property book, our attachment point remains steady, and the per occurrence loss deductible is unchanged at $100 million. For 2024, we have placed coverage for $3.5 billion of the $4.5 billion layer above the $3.5 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have obtained the extra protection in light of the recent inflationary impact on insured values. With context, we've never hit this treaty. Nonetheless, this is prudent, affordable balance sheet protection for tail events. The cost of the additional reinsurance will be largely offset by the strong renewal pricing we continue to achieve on our direct written property premiums resulting in only a de minimis impact on the underlying combined ratio. On a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2024, we thought it would be helpful to once again highlight the seasonality of our CAT losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest CAT quarter. CAT losses in the second quarter have been, on average, more than three combined ratio points higher than in any other quarter and the second quarter has been our largest CAT quarter in seven of the past 10 years. Also of interest for 2024, in light of continued strong pricing and terms in the E&S and reinsurance markets, we are pleased to share that we have renewed the 20% quota share with Fidelis. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had for 2023. The written premium volume, which will again be included as part of international within the Business Insurance segment is not expected to be material to the segment. but should have a modestly favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio for 2024 as it earns in. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As you may have seen, S&P issued their updated capital model, and we now expect that the result of the new model will be a modest improvement in their assessment of our capital metrics. Interest rates decreased and spreads narrowed during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.5 billion after tax at September 30 to $3.1 billion after tax at year end. As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have a little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $122.90 at year end, up 8% from a year ago. We returned $298 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $66 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Thinking about share repurchases in 2024, while there is no change in our capital management philosophy, we will factor in the need for increased capital in light of our top line growth as well as the $435 million we just deployed to complete the Corvus acquisition. Currently, we expect repurchases in the first quarter of somewhere around $250 million. Recapping our results for 2023. Core income was $3.1 billion, and core ROE was 11.5%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, earned premium, underlying underwriting income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. We've never been better positioned for the year ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Last year at this time, I indicated that we were firing on all cylinders, and that certainly remains the case today. Segment income for the quarter was $957 million, our highest quarter ever and up well over $200 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower catastrophes. The all-in combined ratio of 86.5% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.8% and an all-time best result. The underlying loss ratio improved by almost 2.5 points from the prior year quarter, with the drivers of the improvement, including the benefit of earned pricing a mix shift to the property line and an impact from non-CAT weather that was modestly favorable to both the prior year and our expectations. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 14% from the prior year to a fourth quarter record of $5 billion, benefiting from high retention, strong renewal premium change and increase in new business levels. As Alan mentioned, given the attractive margins in this segment, we're very pleased with this growth. Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 11.8%, with renewal rate change of 7.4% and continued strong growth and exposure. Renewal rate change increased from the third quarter in select and middle market, however, ticked down at the segment level, driven almost entirely by a lower mix of national property written premium in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Retention remained excellent at 87% and new business of $672 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. As for renewal rate change, during the quarter, we achieved meaningful renewal rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp. The property, umbrella and auto lines led the way. Renewal rate change in each of the casualty lines was comparable or better than the third quarter. And given our high quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.9%, up more than 1.5 point (ph) from the third quarter driven by renewal rate change, which increased to 4.1% for the quarter. Even with strong pricing, retention remained very strong at 85%. New business was up $49 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change of 10.4% and retention of 90% remained historically strong. New business of $348 million was an all-time best fourth quarter result. As we close out 2023, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income was nearly $2.6 billion, an exceptional result. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9%, top line of $20.4 billion renewal premium change, retention and new business premiums were all record results. These results are a d"

These results are a direct reflection of our successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages. For example, during the year, we continued to advance our data and analytics capabilities by leveraging evolving technologies, including AI, and new data sources to help us manage the portfolio and equip our frontline underwriters with data and insights to better enable our risk selection, underwriting and pricing. In addition, we continued to advance our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in all but a couple of states, as well as our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 14 states. Both products deliver industry-leading segmentation and user experiences. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing other industry leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. In our Small Commercial business, we continued to roll out our new front end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, while maintaining all the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. We're proud of these extraordinary results in the best-in-class team that produce them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty ended a strong 2023 with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $240 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. delivered very strong underlying underwriting income and an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 80.6%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, in line with the prior year quarter, while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. New business was up driven by a new domestic cyber capacity agreement with Corvus. Surety net written premiums increased 9%, reflecting continued strong demand for surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, capping off a year during which we generated record segment income and net written premium. Finally, we're pleased that earlier this month, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Corvus Insurance. Corvus is an industry leading cyber insurance managing general underwriter, powered by proprietary technology. Corvus has developed cutting edge capabilities, including digitally integrated cyber sales, underwriting, service and support, sophisticated underwriting algorithms and advanced vulnerability scanning. Corvus also brings deep cyber underwriting and risk management expertise, and we're pleased to welcome them to the Travelers family. This acquisition affords us the opportunity to write Corvus' profitable book of business which will be reflected as new business in our production results over the course of 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Personal Insurance generated $520 million of fourth quarter segment income, strong results and a significant improvement compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.9% improved over 10 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting improvements in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 13%, driven by continued elevated levels of renewal premium change in both auto and home bringing full year net written premiums to a record of nearly $16 billion. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%, the underlying combined ratio of 102.7% improved nearly 8 points compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. To a lesser extent, it also benefited from the year-over-year impact of a modest favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year compared to a modest unfavorable re-estimation in the prior year quarter. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 70.8% improved by over 28 points, reflecting catastrophe losses that were favorable to both the prior year quarter and our expectations and an improved underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio improved 12.5 points, primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related losses that were favorable to both the prior year and our expectations and the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production. Our results demonstrate our continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate actions to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile retention remained consistent. Renewal premium change of 16.7% remains strong and as expected, moderated from the third quarter of 2023 and as the majority of our book reached rate adequacy on a written basis. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024 as we continue to assess the environment and seek rate on a state-by-state basis as appropriate. We're pleased to note that auto new business increased relative to the prior year quarter, as we tempered our non-rate actions in states where we've achieved written rate adequacy. We will continue to evaluate our non-rate measures as more states reach adequacy throughout 2024. In Homeowners and Other, retention remained consistent even as renewal premium change reached a record level at 21.2%, primarily driven by higher renewal rate change. As we noted last quarter, we expect homeowners' renewal premium change to moderate to low double-digits in 2024. We will continue to see great increases in response to elevated loss levels. But at the same time, our automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels, reflecting the progress we've made on aligning insured values with replacement costs. Our continued efforts to manage new business flow and thoughtfully deploy capacity in the face of market dislocation drove the year-over-year decline in homeowners new business and policies enforced during the quarter. We anticipate this trend will continue as we take further actions to improve profitability and manage growth in property. In 2023, we made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business and are moving towards our goal of delivering target returns. While the environment remains dynamic, we're confident we're on a path to generating leading returns in Personal Insurance and growing profitably over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks very much. We're happy to open up for your questions."

It's Dan. So we're not going to put numbers on them. But price versus trend has been favorable throughout the last couple of years and was favorable again -- favorable again this quarter. A little bit of a mix shift towards property, as Greg said, and modestly favorable non-CAT weather impact, not huge but worth to mention, but we're not going to put numbers on each of those.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Thanks. And then I think it's been five of the last seven quarters or something like that where you guys called out the general liability and umbrella as areas of reserve increases in Business Insurance. I'm wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about exactly what you guys are seeing and reacting to, and if you think we're closer to the end of some of these true-ups?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nSure, David. It's Dan, again. So not big, big movements this quarter, more of the same, more of what we\u2019ve sort of been talking about the last couple of quarters, which is no surprises in terms of the themes of the things that we\u2019re seeing come through those numbers, but the magnitude has been a little greater than we had allowed for previously, and we\u2019re just looking at the data that comes in every quarter and try to make sure we stay as current with it as we can. And so a modest reaction to keep up with that, but nothing really new."

But I wanted to focus on Slide 7, the return on equity slide and you guys have all mapped out really a pretty strong outlook. And I guess, I'm trying to reconcile what is looks to be a very pretty good outlook with the fact that your ROE is running below where I think it should be. I feel like the ROE should be running higher. So maybe, Alan, you can provide some perspectives because I know the ROE is an important factor that you guys look at.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Greg. It's Dan. I'll start. So look, 11.5% for ROE for a full year, pretty good number, another year, double-digits, well above our cost of capital. and the risk-free rate, not quite where we'd like it to be. And I think the biggest contributor, and as you called out, Slide 7 is that yellow bar from the contribution from underwriting really impacted, as we talked about, especially in the second quarter and the third quarter by a very elevated level of catastrophe losses for the year, that's not what we expect to be the new normal run rate. We're certainly factoring more recent CAT experience into our view of CAT expectations going forward, but we wouldn't expect it to be elevated at that level.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nGreg, it's Alan. The other thing I would add to that is, I won't tell you would do, but one of the things I do every quarter is, is try to take a stab at normalizing these things. And so eliminate prior year development and put in for CATs, whatever you think is a normalized CAT number and then you get a different perspective.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nRight. Okay. And then Dan, I just wanted to go back to your comments about share repurchase and uses of capital. I know you talked about the expectation for what's going to happen in the first quarter, and you talked about capital. Are there any other things you'd like to call out in terms of capital allocation outside of dividends and share repurchase.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nLet me start with that, and then I'll see what observations Dan has on that. So I think we've said for a very long time, our first objective for every dollar of capital we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and achieve our objectives and contribute to shareholder value. But we think we've got a long track record that demonstrates our discipline with shareholders' capital. And so we're going to invest the money back in the business when we can and that could be keeping capital on the balance sheet to support profitable growth. It could be buying things like Corvus. It could be investing in technology or people doing the things that we think we can do that are accretive to our objectives. And when we can't do that, we're going to give the dollars back. So it's a long-winded way of saying no change at all in our capital management plans (ph). Dan, you want to add?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nI agree entirely. There's no hidden message in there, Greg. It's business as usual."

It's Dan. So really not going to put a very fine number on it. Keep in mind now that Fidelis is now a standalone public company. They haven't reported results yet. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to give an outlook of what we felt about their profitability. But it was a modest help in 2023, it will be a modest help again in 2024, there'll be a little bigger base of earned premium as we'll have two years' worth of written impacting 2024. So worth calling out as a modest benefit, but not a big number, and I really don't think it would be appropriate for us to try to put a finer number on it than that.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. Thank you. Then on, within personal auto, what percent of your states or premium still have non-rate restrictions in place.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nElyse, I don't think we'll get more specific than the majority, but you can think of the non-rate restrictions as tracking very closely with where we see written adequacy state-by-state. So the majority of the premium is in states where we have relaxed some of those or tempered some of those non-rate actions because the majority of premium is in states where we\u2019ve got target returns on a written basis. And again, as I indicated in the \u2013 in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ll continue to follow that path as more states get adequate will temper actions in those states as they reach adequacy."

Could you just, I guess, talk a little bit about the relative pricing dynamics in those three markets?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nGood morning, Ryan. It's Greg. Yeah. You can see, if you look at underneath the pricing, you can see rate is up in both the middle market and Select business. So the residual that makes up the total BI, you're correct, the preponderance of that is national property. And so a couple of dynamics this quarter in National Property One is when that plays out to the total book, we did have less weight on a net written premium national property this quarter, quarter four versus quarter three and quarter two. And we did have a tick down overall in rates national property also just given where the returns are in that business, and the business is performing extremely well.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nBut make no mistake, Ryan, the overall rate change and renewal price change in the property line continues to be very strong.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. We're not used to seeing this type of margin expansion in Business Insurance. I would think that would mean that's largely attributable to short tail lines. But I guess I was also curious, obviously, rate's been running an excessive onstream and casualties well for a while. We have been really talked about changing loss picks or anything like that. But was there a change on the casualty side to I guess, loss picks in the fourth quarter? Any true-up to the current year or something like that we should be aware of?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nNo, Ryan. It's Dan. Like, if we have an unusual item in the quarter that's sort of non-run rate, we'll usually try and call it out for you, including some kind of year-to-date catch-up, Michael referred to it in PI auto, but you didn't hear Greg talk about anything significant in BI because there wasn't really anything significant in BI. So we do \u2013 what we always do, right, go through all the lines there\u2019s puts and takes across every line, looking at frequency and severity.

First question is maybe looking for a little bit more color on some of the pleasantly surprising commentary about the general liability and umbrella returns still being very good despite but someone else had pointed out, was five of the last seven quarters adding to reserves. So just curious, is there any more -- can you elaborate on that? Is that maybe you're taking into account the -- you don't typically hear that. Maybe it's the investment income that's helping or its sold as part of a package. And so the rest of the products are running at better returns or anything you could add to that? Thanks.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Mike. It's Dan. So we're thinking about the returns, and that is our all-in view of return, but we are specifically looking at those lines when we make that comment, although, we do, to your point, also pay a lot of attention to returns on an account basis. But those comments were specific to the liability and umbrella lines. And this really goes back to the comment that Alan made a couple of quarters ago, which is -- the amounts that were, I'll say, tweaking prior year reserve development by is really pretty modest in the scope and the scheme of those reserves. And when we look at the total volume of business that we're writing and the returns on an over time basis, we still both like both of those lines very much.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAnother way to think about it, Mike, might be that you think about it in terms of rate adequacy and you might have an attractive rate adequacy, you might make an adjustment to it. It might be to one degree or another, slightly less rate adequate, nonetheless, you like the rate adequacy. So that's -- it's in that context, we say we continue to like to returns in those lines.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, Alan, you continue to mention and show gauges of free cash flow. You also mentioned that it's -- I still don't think it's appreciated, at least I don't appreciate it, why it's important. So maybe you can try to further elaborate on is it -- is the increase in cash flows, which I assume is correlated with your increased growth. Is that actually aiding your ROE or what are we -- why should we be focusing more on free cash flow, which has a lot of moving parts in it.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYeah. I wouldn't say it's just growth. It's a combination of profitable growth is what I would say about that. And as I've said, that I mean that's what gives us the flexibility to invest in all the important things we invest in, return capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. So without strong free cash flow, we couldn't do those three things, and those are key to our operating model."

First question, if I look at the underlying combined ratio on your Business Insurance it's, I believe, the best it's ever been since the St. Paul merger and public prior to that just on the numbers. I guess can you kind of talk a little bit about -- is that a sustainable kind of underlying combined ratio, underlying margin? Is there more improvement potentially can go there? At what point do you kind of say, okay, the margins we're seeing on the business are about as good as we should have and maybe more focus on growth and more expenses and other things. How do you balance that?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nIt's a really good question. And as you can imagine, I'm going to resist the temptation to try to share too much on an outlook of that number or what we might want to do strategically. Everything you mentioned is something we can think about. And I really would like to get away from talking about the future of margins. But we've answered that question before with loss trend where it is and pricing where it is. So you can conclude that answer hasn't really changed. So I think I'm just going to leave it with we really like these margins. We really like the business we're putting on the books at the margin we're putting it on the books and we really like the opportunity ahead of us.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nBrian, this is Greg. Just one follow-up. I would note you said you could grow the business. We are growing the business 16% on a full year basis and have strong new business. So there's a number of items that we watch and we compete in the marketplace, but growth is one of them through the lens of adequacy of our products.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYeah. And on that note, as I've shared before, we -- it's a [indiscernible] in this industry to try to grow and compete on price. That's a losing proposition. We try to grow by making sure we've got the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. Thanks. And then, Michael, I'm just curious, back on personal auto. When you look at your business, the majority right now being all on a written basis, what are you kind of thinking from a loss cost in place in perspective? And is that maybe why you're not stepping on growth maybe a little bit quicker right now because of uncertainty as far as the claim severity?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Brian. It's a great question. I would say that we continue to see loss trends moderate in personal auto but they remain at elevated levels. And so I guess I would describe our outlook as cautiously optimistic, and I would just say we're staying very disciplined, as I described earlier, with state-by-state execution, making sure we have our arms around written rate adequacy and then adjusting our marketplace actions in auto accordingly. And as I said, we're very pleased with the increase in new business production that we saw this quarter and policies in force stabilizing. And our plan is to continue down that path, achieve rate equity in additional states and for those non-rate actions as we go and see what that does to the top line as we move forward."

We've heard some comments about it moving back towards normalized levels and I'm wondering what Travelers experience is?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Meyer. It's Dan. So sure, a couple of comments on that. We do see some paid medical severity. That's now higher than what we saw in the very benign pandemic levels. On the flip side of that, frequency has been pretty favorable. And as you know, we've shared a number of times previously, our view in reserving and in pricing still assumes that there's going to be a return to that higher longer-term trend. But when we factor all that in, in the most recent data that we're looking at, loss costs still coming in better than we expected, and that's why you get another quarter of favorable PYD.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Fantastic. And then switching gears, when we look at the, I guess, the premium data in Business Insurance, it looks like exposure and other components that are not rates accelerated in Select, but decelerated in middle market and property. And I was hoping you could talk us through that.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nHey, Meyer. This is Greg. We have a couple of dynamics going on between those two businesses. In Select, we have a higher exposure in workers' comp E&CMP (ph). And for workers' comp relative to middle market, I think that it's just a different cohort of customers. So in a wage increase environment on a smaller customer base, you get bigger deltas and so that's what's driving the difference in workers' comp. CMP, similar to what Michael said, that\u2019s our business owner product with a heavy property coverage that comes with it in. So we do have to think of it as an automatic inflationary level underneath the CMP product, so you get a little more exposure to growth there also. So those are the drivers underneath the difference between select and middle."

And I was just interested in hearing a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I mean I look at the returns, how the underlying loss ratios are and so forth and the ROEs that suggests and yet price accelerating and in some areas, your business retention is actually hitting pretty darn high levels. So it also gets a lot of discipline in the marketplace. And just wanted to get your perspective on what is it in the environment that's causing everyone to remain so disciplined despite good underwriting and the additional contribution to net investment income.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAlex, good morning. It's Alan. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Greg to add anything I missed. But I would say, overall, you're correct. The pricing environment remains very strong and broad based by any historical standard or on any measure. And as you said, even with another quarter of very strong pricing, retention remains at historical highs. And I would say in broad strokes and there's really no change here from recent quarters. In broad strokes, I think there are two trends impacting pricing. On the one hand, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, and there's some headwinds. So the reinsurance market continues to be strong. You've got inflation of various varieties. You've got a tight labor market. I think weather is probably on everybody's minds, think about geopolitics these days, the world has never been more active than it is now and on and on. And so I can't speak for anybody else, but we're reacting to those things in our pricing. At the same time, we've had -- returns were in a much better place than they were a few years ago because we've done a pretty good job with pricing terms, conditions and all the rest. And so the pricing you see from us, and you referred to it as a competitive marketplace. I would say that it is a marketplace that is pretty disciplined. I suspect reacting to many of the things that we're reacting to. Greg, anything to add?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nNo, I think that's spot on.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. The second one I had is on personal auto. Can you just give us maybe a high-level idea of what's going on with severity in the claims, and we can look a lot at used cars and that kind of thing, but some of the more new settlements around core repair and that kind of thing. Any color you can provide on some of those trends?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYeah. Sure, Alex. It's Michael. Maybe just give a couple more comments relative to the comment I made earlier about moderating trends. You're right to point to sort of vehicle severity and used car prices, and we certainly see moderation there in the level of increase year-on-year. And in fact, when you look at the dynamics underneath the prior period adjustments that I described in the script, those really are driven by the physical damage coverages. Late last year, we were adding to our estimates for vehicle losses because physical damage coverages were rising more than we thought they were going to. And this year, we actually took down some of our estimates for vehicle severity on prior periods because they've been a bit more favorable than we anticipated. Broadly speaking, severity in auto is running mid to high0single digits, think closer to mid in the vehicle severity, think closer to high and bodily injury. And so that\u2019s sort of where trends are running today. We don\u2019t have a dramatic improvement in those trends sort of factored into our comments about when we\u2019re going to get to written adequacy state by state or those types of things, but that\u2019s a little bit more detail on sort of where things are running today. The other thing that we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of quarters throughout the year is we are also monitoring the mix of losses between vehicle loss and losses that have third-party property damage and bodily injury. We\u2019ve seen a bit of a mix shift towards more bodily injury claims, which is one of the things that has us keeping our severity trend estimates at that sort of elevated level."

So in property, again, the big driver of the improvement this quarter really was catastrophes and non-CAT weather. The non-CAT weather and I guess the non-weather loss dynamic that I would elaborate on is a lot of that non-CAT weather favorability and some of the non-weather loss favorability that we've commented on throughout 2023, really has been frequency driven. We do still see pretty healthy severity trends in the property space, offsetting some of that favorable frequency. Now again, we've had favorable results in the quarter. So the net is a good guy. But labor and some large loss pressure along with that favorable frequency is what's happening kind of underneath the loss levels in property.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nI'm just curious for some time, I think we've seen a little bit of a divergence between commercial auto and personal lines auto.

This is Jeff Klink. So relative to D&O and cyber, public D&O pricing continues to be, I'd say, more pressured relative to the other liability lines. I would remind you that for public D&O and our management liability book, we're relatively underweight there, that's not been a major area of focus for us. On the cyber side, we continue to see some modest negative pricing there, I think, given some broader market perception on the returns in the line. Again, we feel really good about our execution there. We closely monitor our return profiles and are comfortable with our execution, both for those lines of business and management liability problem.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nGot it. Great. And along the same lines in Business Insurance with regard to workers' comp, I was wondering if you could put some numbers around that paid medical severity higher than the benign numbers you were seeing during the pandemic. I think that was in response to Meyer's question. And then the same question on the pricing of workers' comp. What are you thinking about going into 2024 as you proceed?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Andrew. It's Dan. So I'll start and disappoint you on the work comp severity. So we're not going to put a number on it. But again, it's been benign. We've seen some of those numbers move up, but your starting point matters. So what you assumed medical severity was going to be inside of your overall loss pick. Pick really matters in terms of whether a move-up is problematic for you or not. And again, we saw more favorable reserve development this quarter. And then in terms of pricing, and I'll turn it to Greg. I think the returns in comp have continued to be good. So pure rate has continued to be slightly negative for us. We are getting strong exposure increases, Greg referenced in the select comments a few minutes ago, that's the poster child for where a lot of that exposure behaves like rate because it's the same worker just earning a higher wage and we're getting paid a higher price for it. The rating agencies, the bureaus are looking at their data on a lagging basis and until returns come under some pressure in work comp, we wouldn't be surprised to see this environment stay pretty steady.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income was $1.1 billion or $4.69 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 15.4%. After-tax core income increased by $126 million, despite a $211 million one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter. On a pre-tax basis, this year's core income was $413 million or 45% higher year-over-year. Strong core income is driven by record net earned premiums of $10.1 billion up 14% compared to the prior year period and an excellent combined ratio 93.9%. The combined ratio improved 1.5 points notwithstanding elevated catastrophe activity primarily in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The underlying combined ratio improved 2.9 points to an outstanding 87.7% driven by strong underlying results in each of our three segments. Looking at the two commercial segment together, the aggregate BIBSI [ph] underlying combined ratio wasn't excellent 88.8% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was 86.1% a 6.8 point improvement over the prior year. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continue to perform well generating after tax net investment income of $698 million for the quarter driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share after returning $620 million of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making important investments in our business, as we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.05 per share marking 20 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $10.2 billion in the quarter. All three segments and excellent execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 9% to $5.6 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, our retention remained high. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined in the face of persistent headwinds. The segment generated a very strong $691 million of new business in the quarter, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In Bond & Specialty Insurance we grew net written premiums by 6% to $943 million. That was driven by strong retention of 90% and record new business in our high quality management liability business along with excellent production in our market leading surety business, where net written premiums were up 15%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, continued strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premiums. Renewal premium change was 16.6% in our auto business and 13.4% in home. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share that more than a hundred of my Travelers colleagues and I just returned from our Travelers leadership conference, TLC as we call it. It's a multi-day event that we host every year for the principals and senior leaders of our most significant distribution partners. Most of our guests have been coming for years, some for decades. We're also pleased every year to host a number of first timers. The represented firms are industry leaders and collectively account for more than half of our premium volume. We all returned home with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business partners and their firms are as strong as ever. We confirm that they remain very supportive of the strategic initiatives that we have underway and we took away valuable feedback on how we can accomplish even more together. The independent agent and broker channel remains a robust and growing part of our industry. At Travelers, we proudly partner with more than 15,000 agent broker firms across their 35,000 locations. We're a top three market for the majority of these firms that's a critical advantage because distributors place a disproportionate amount of their business with their top few carriers. We don't take these relationships for granted. As we've shared before, the vision for innovation agenda includes optimizing our value proposition as an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. We continue to make significant investments to ensure that we realize that vision by offering best-in-class products, services, and experiences. Case in point, in our Bond & Specialty business, we recently conducted a blind survey of agents and brokers, ours and others, to determine how we ranked on the 10 attributes they identified as most likely to impact their placement decisions. Among our key competitors, we ranked first or tied for first in each of the 10 categories. We are over and over again that Travelers deep specializa"

We are over and over again that Travelers deep specialization across a wide range of modernized, simplified, and tailored products, along with a broad and consistent appetite are major differentiators for us in the market. For example, in Business Insurance, we offer a wide variety of coverages and product solutions. Admitted and DNS, across industries representing more than 85% of domestic GDP. Everything from a bought product for a local florist to a package solution for a main street middle market account to a loss sensitive workers compensation for a large national account. Across our three business segments, our distribution partners generally don't need to go to multiple carriers to satisfy customers' insurance needs. And the more lines per account we write, the higher the lifetime value of the customer. The primary focus of ours has been digitizing the value chain, in part to create value and provide great experiences for our agents and brokers, and in part to create efficiencies for them and for us. I'll share a few examples. In Business Insurance, we believe we were the first to offer agents and brokers a comprehensive portfolio loss data exchange, which allows us to digitally transfer to a small commercial or middle market distributor, loss information on their entire book with us. This capability enables our distribution partners to efficiently develop important insights into their books of business and supports their marketing efforts. In our middle market business, we believe we were the first carrier to offer multi-line digital submission capabilities. In our small commercial business, agents can transact with us through APIs or through our new quote and issue platform Travis, which is reduced quoting time by 25% for our leading BOP product. Across Business Insurance, nearly all of our largest distributors are currently leveraging one or more of our digital capabilities. In Personal Insurance, earlier this year, we added our proprietary aerial image reviewer to our agent portal. This advanced capability integrates a high resolution, over time photo series of a home into agents quoting workflow. This gives our partners a bird's eye view, helping them to better understand the customers or prospects insurance needs and how they may have evolved. We bring our franchise value directly to agents and brokers through distribution, underwriting, sales and claim professionals in more than 80 local offices. Through our expansive and empowered field organization, we foster deep relationships with our partners and are well-positioned to deliver the strength and expertise of travelers at the local level. We're also investing in our distribution partner\u2019s workforces by providing education and training programs to their up and coming producers. Our Flagship Travelers agency leadership program and agency producer school provide in-person training to invited participants. We also offer larger virtual programs that have trained thousands of producers, including more than 3,000 just last year. We remain deeply committed to our vision of being the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. Our pole position with this, with leading distributors is a significant competitive advantage and one that's hard to replicate. To sum it up, the year is off to a terrific start with strong profitability and production in all three segments, as well as higher investment income. In short, we're firing on all cylinders. We also continue to invest in important strategic initiatives. We have demonstrated success in executing our innovation strategy, which has contributed to superior returns with industry low volatility, both in our premium base and higher adjusted book value per share. With this momentum and the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter increased by 13% to $1.1 billion. And core return on equity was 15.4%. The growth in core income was driven by higher net investment income, and despite the one-time tax benefit in the prior year that Alan mentioned, higher underlying underwriting income, partially offset by a higher level of catastrophe losses. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.2 billion was up 50% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio that improved by 2.9 points to 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio was among our best ever and featured continued strong results in both Business Insurance and bond and specialty, complemented by a strong result in personal insurance, reflecting another quarter of significant improvement. We were pleased with the first quarter expense ratio of 28.7%, which was flat year-over-year despite the impact of Corvus, for which we had a full quarter of expenses, but very little earned premium, as there was no unearned premium carried in from the closing of the transaction on January 2nd. For the full year, we remained comfortable with an expense ratio expectation of 28% to 28.5%. We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $91 million pre-tax in the first quarter. There was no net prior year reserve change in Business Insurance, as favorable development and workers comp of nearly $100 million was largely offset by modest increases for liability coverages in recent accident years, along with modest charges in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $24 million pre-tax was driven by better than expected results across multiple lines. Personal Insurance recorded net favorable PYD of $67 million pre-tax, with improvements in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income increased 25% from the prior year quarter to $698 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations, benefiting from both higher levels, higher yields, and a higher level of invested assets. Returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were also up from last year's quarter. Our updated outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, is $640 million after-tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $665 million in the third quarter, and then to around $690 million in the fourth quarter. Regarding income taxes in the first quarter, recall that last year's quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $211 million related to the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847, and that's the main reason you see a higher effective tax rate in this year's quarter. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates increased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.1 billion after-tax at year-end to $3.7 billion after-tax at March 31st. Remember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high, and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus, or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $125.53 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end, and up 8% from a year ago. Share repurchases this quarter included $250 million of open market repurchases. We had an additional $138 million of buybacks in connection with employee share based compensation plans. We have approximately $5.8 billion remaining under prior"

We have approximately $5.8 billion remaining under prior board authorizations for share repurchases. Dividends were $232 million in the quarter, and as Alan mentioned earlier, our board authorized a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share. In summary, the quarter's strong results once again demonstrate the significant earnings power of our ability to grow premiums across our well-diversified book of business while maintaining very attractive margins, along with steadily increasing net investment income from our growing and fixed income portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to deliver exceptional results with a strong first quarter of 2024 in terms of both the top and bottom lines. Segment income of $764 million was up from the first quarter of 2023 driven by higher net investment income and higher pre-tax underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2% among our best ever. Net written premiums increased 9% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.6 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.6% with renewal rate change of 7% driving most of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 86% and new business of $691 million was an all-time first quarter high. Let me give you a little more texture on the continued strong pricing environment. Renewal rate change remained high, coming in at 7% or higher for the fourth quarter in a row. It was also up almost 2.5 points from the first quarter of 2023. In our select and core middle market businesses, renewal rate remained consistent with the fourth quarter. Renewal rate change in our national property book was strong and in the double digits, but down a couple points sequentially. That's an appropriate result threading the needle between healthy returns in the business and continued weather volatility. From a line perspective, umbrella, property, and auto led the way. All with renewal rate change in or very close to double digits. Renewal rate change was higher compared to the preceding and prior year quarters in GL, Umbrella, Auto, E&CMP [ph]. In workers' comp, renewal rate change was about half a point more than negative than the preceding and prior year quarters. With continued healthy exposure, renewal premium change in comp continues to be positive in the low single digits. Again, an appropriate result given the strong results in the line. Retention remained healthy across the board. We're pleased with our production results, the exceptional granular execution by our field organization, and the resulting growth in top line and attractive margins. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remains strong at 10.4% with renewal rate change of 4%, consistent with the fourth quarter and up more than two points from the first quarter of 2023. Retention also remained strong at 84%, while new business increased 22% from the prior year quarter to $156 million, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We're also encouraged with the impact we're seeing from Travis, our new front end rate, quote, and issue interface platform that Alan mentioned. In middle market, renewal premium change was 10% with renewal rate change of 7%, consistent with the strong fourth quarter result and up close to three points from the prior year quarter. Retention remains strong at 87%. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President of Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty started the year with another quarter of strong returns in our 29th consecutive quarter of profitable net written premium growth. Segment income was $195 million, driven by strong earned premiums and a combined ratio of 84.5%. Underneath the combined ratio, the underlying loss ratio improved 2.7 points to an excellent 46.4%. As Dan mentioned, the expense ratio was elevated compared to recent periods, primarily due to the Corvus acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for the next several quarters as we integrate and earn in Corvus' business. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90% with slightly higher sequential renewal premium change. We grew new business by 34% from the prior year quarter to a record $91 million, driven by Corvus production. As a reminder, we are in the midst of transitioning Corvus' $200 million profitable book of business onto Traveler's paper, which will continue to be reflected in our new business production in the coming quarters. Net written premiums in our market-leading surety business grew a terrific 15%, reflecting continued strong demand for our surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report Personal Insurance generated first quarter segment income of $220 million and a combined ratio of 96.9%, both of which are significantly improved relative to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 86.1% reflects a 6.8 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 9% as a result of continued price increases in both auto and home. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio of 94.6% improved 10 points compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 94.9% improved 8.5 points compared to the prior year, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. At the same time, vehicle severity trends moderated, and the quarter also included a modest frequency benefit from the mild winter. As a brief reminder, the first quarter underlying combined ratio is typically our seasonally lowest in auto. We are very pleased with the trajectory of auto profitability. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.1% was impacted by higher catastrophe losses, reflecting an active cat quarter, with 19 PCS designated events for the industry, more than 50% higher than the long-term average. The underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved 5 points, primarily driven by the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production, our results demonstrate continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate measures to balance profitability and growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained strong, and renewal premium change of 16.6% was consistent with our expectations. Given the improving profitability of our book, we continue to expect renewal premium change to moderate throughout 2024. New business premium was consistent with the prior year quarter. Underneath this headline number, new business volumes grew in states where we have achieved written rate adequacy. In homeowners and other, retention of 84% remained strong and was consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change of 13.4% reflected higher renewal rate change, and was consistent with our expectations, as we have largely closed the gap in insurance to value. We expect renewal p"

We expect renewal premium change to remain at these levels throughout 2024, as we continue to seek rate in response to elevated loss costs. The declines in homeowners' new business and policies in force reflect our ongoing efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity, as we continue to manage rate adequacy, catastrophe risk, and regulatory risk. Personal Insurance team has made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business, while sustaining investments in key capabilities for the future. We're moving closer to our goal of delivering target returns. Auto profitability continues to improve. We have reached written rate adequacy in all but a few states, and are continuing to temper non-rate actions accordingly. For homeowners, we remain focused on managing growth, while improving profitability. At the same time, we're delivering key strategic capabilities. In February, we completed two noteworthy product launches, Quantum Boat 2.0 in the U.S., and Optima Home in Canada. Quantum Boat 2.0 delivers a better agent and customer experience, with improved segmentation, and strengthens our position as a provider of total account solutions, building on the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 and Quantum Home 2.0. Optima Home is an extension of our market-leading Quantum Home 2.0 property product, enabling us to deliver a more robust total account solution in the Canadian market. Both product launches mark further progress on our journey to modernize our products and platforms, making us an even more compelling choice for customers and distributors. To sum it up, I'm very pleased with the positive start to the year in Personal Insurance and grateful to our team. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abby. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Head of Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. We're ready to open up for questions."

Good morning. I had a question just on the more recent accident year reserve increases in Business Insurance and some of those liability lines that Dan was highlighting. I'm wondering, is there any more detail you can provide here with regards to specific accident years? It sounded like GL. Also, I don't think you guys are alone in seeing some adverse on these years. I think everyone had thought that these were better priced years relative to 2019 and prior. Could you just talk about what exactly is the disconnect here and why there's some adverse coming on those years?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, David. It's Dan. Sure. I'll take that. Yes. By more recent accident years, we're not talking about 15 through 19. We're talking about years more recent than that. I guess the thing I'll reiterate from my comments is we're talking about some pretty small movements here. We had some adverse in those recent accident year liability lines. We also had some modest charges in the runoff book. I think what we're doing here, David, is trying to be reactive to all the information we're seeing those recent accident years in the liability lines, which tend to take longer to develop and be on the books for a while, are more leveraged to IB&R. We're just trying to get some more IB&R into those lines to recognize that uncertainty.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nDavid, its Alan. The other thing I'd add is there's not any significant new developments here. These are generally the same trends we've been talking about for a long time, a little more of the same. Again, to reiterate Dan's comment, when you look at the overall reserves we have for these lines, these are very small adjustments.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. Then, maybe just switching gears to the personal auto business, Michael, I think you had mentioned that there was maybe some benefit just from mild frequency given a warmer than typical first quarter. Is there any way you could size that just to help us think about the sustainability of the improvement in the auto business?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, sure, David. I think the mild frequency impact on the underlying combined ratio was a little less than a point.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):"

Maybe you could step back and give us some context about, or texture I think is the word you used, about the competitive environment. Curious, given all the rate change that's coming through, why we haven't seen more aggressive actions on behalf of some of the competitors yet, or maybe there's still reconciling previous year's results as well.

Hard for us to comment for competitors, but we do think that in the pricing we've been able to achieve with these retentions, you do see a reflection of the competitive environment. I'd say that everybody is, well, what we would speculate is that everybody's reacting to the same things that we're reacting to. There's returns in a much better place after years of pricing and improvements in terms and conditions, but there are some headwinds and some uncertainty out there. All the things we've talked about, there's social inflation, economic inflation, a tight labor market. Weather, geopolitics, I think, puts a certain lens over the way we all see the world. I suspect what you have is a marketplace that's reacting to an overall level of risk and uncertainty.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nI guess I'll pivot then. If you look at the proxy statement, I know ROE targets are a very important metric for you all. I think the target was 12.8% for 2023 up from 11.6% from 2022. Can you talk about how you're looking at the ROE targets for the company for 2024, please?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, I don't think we're going to share that target. It gets competitively sensitive and close to pricing. But I will say we think about that in terms of the overall outlook for our business. We think about the rate at which the interest rate environment is earning into the fixed income portfolio, which turns over on a lag basis. And we think about really what we want to achieve as a margin over both the 10-year treasury and our cost of equity. So those are the things we think about as we put the plan together. Dan, anything else I'm missing there?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nNo, you got it all.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

I think you guys said that Q1 is seasonally the lowest combined ratio quarter, but you still have a good amount of rate earning in the book. So shouldn't that obscure some of the seasonality, or would you expect Q1 to be better from a combined ratio perspective on the underlying side relative to the other three quarters of the year, even knowing you have rate to earn in?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Elyse. It's Michael. So just taking a step back and talking about auto, the seasonality comment is a long-term average comment. Typically, Q1 is roughly three points lower than the overall combined ratio for the year. But that's, again, a long-term average and largely an all-else equal environment. So that three points doesn't adjust for earned effective pricing potentially having impact in the back half of the year. And so you have to make an adjustment for that, no question. But, again, I would just take a step back and maybe put a little more color around my response to David as well. So the mild winter weather benefit we would view as sort of a one-off in the quarter that we wouldn't expect to continue, we don't see any reason to assume adjusted for that. That seasonality is any different today than it was historically. And at the end of the day, to the premise of your question, the earned effective pricing is far and away the biggest driver of the improvement in the quarter, and there's more of that to come going forward.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my second question, I wanted to go back to the liability reserve increase in the quarter. Could you give us a sense, if there were some additions, I know the numbers are modest, like you guys said, on accident year 2023. And then, given the additions you see here, are you adjusting your longer trend, long-term loss trend assumption for the liability lines following this?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nSo, Elyse, it's Dan. I'll start with the PYD piece and avoid the temptation of splitting what is a small number to begin with into its individual accident years. So we're not going to do that. I do think if you look at the results in Business Insurance, we talked about the fact that you saw some improvement in the underlying combined ratio, including in the underlying loss ratio. You have the benefit of pricing and a couple of other things like mix, which we talked about last quarter. The same time, like in any quarter, you've got some puts and takes, and one of those puts and takes in this quarter is booking a little bit more IB&R in the current accident year to reflect some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Not big numbers, but we are reacting to it.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

Michael, I'm just curious, one of your competitors in the personal auto space is showing some pretty strong growth in policy and so forth, really kind of capitalizing the market. I'm just curious, are you in a position at this point to kind of go after and get some growth given how your results have improved so much?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Certainly, again, underneath the results in the quarter, if you look at it on a state-by-state basis, the states where we have achieved written adequacy, we've achieved written adequacy, we did achieve new business premium growth. And consistent with our comments last quarter, what I would say to you is we're executing a very granular state-by-state, geography-by-geography strategy as we look to temper some of the non-rate actions that we had in place in auto. And if you take a step back, if you look at it over the last couple of years, we have a small increase in policies in force in auto over the last couple years or so. We got a small decrease in property, all the while premiums are up 30-plus percent. So we feel pretty good about the starting point. And directly to your question, our focus in auto is on profitably growing auto on a go-forward basis. Our focus on home remains on improving profitability, and so that's why we talk about sort of balancing profitability and growth across the whole portfolio.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. Thanks. And then a follow-up on the Business Insurance. Alan and Greg, I wonder if you could kind of dissect kind of the competitive landscape, kind of large, middle, small. Are any of them kind of incrementally more competitive? It feels like small, middle seems to be a little more stable right now than maybe the large from what we're hearing in the marketplace.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nBrian, let me just comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg. I think all of these markets are always competitive all the time, and that's sort of the way we think about it. So I'm not sure. I mean, as Greg shared in his prepared remarks, to the extent that you're thinking about, renewal price change as a proxy for competition, and I don't think it is, by the way. That did come down a couple of points, but, again, still among our highest rate achieved in any line, and, double digits and a reflection of terrific returns in the line. So I don't think there's been any sea change in or any significant shift, among those businesses. I'd say competitive business that we have. I don't know, Greg.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, maybe I'll touch on new business since Alan just hit on rate. And you can see in the new business we had a real strong quarter in small commercial up 22%, so that we are seeing a little more dislocation in that market than we are in middle market. But the combination of our new segmented product, BOP 2.0, and our new commercial automobile product, we feel terrific about, our position there and where we're writing that new business and what returns we're going to achieve there. Middle market still had, the delta wasn't as big on new business, but we had a record result on the first quarter of the prior year, so really strong new business levels. So not as much dislocation, Brian, in the middle market, but really feeling good about the combination of where the returns are and our field team staying really active on the new business front.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

So, yes, exposure acting as rates clearly been a tailwind in particular for margins. It's been flagged, for the past couple years, especially in the workers' comp line. But this is the first quarter in a long time I think, I've seen that workers' comp NPW shrink year-over-year. So curious sort of, what dynamic might be going on there?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes. Good morning, Ryan. How you doing? This is Greg. Yes, exposure continues to be strong, down somewhat as you look at the businesses. Not a surprise to us as the Fed has been very active in curtailing inflation. So definitely we're seeing some of that in workers' comp. But the primary driver of the down in comp is, we do still have rate reductions, as I shared in my prepared comments, relative to the other products. And as we're an account solution, we're going to remain very active and disciplined with our underwriting. And as we invoke both of those dynamics in the business, that's what drove the overall net written premium change in the comp line.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And I guess if I look at the overall, the exposure is still positive across the book. So clearly something else is picking that up. On the property side, are you guys still getting positive exposure adjustments from like insured value adjustments? Or is that really just kind of a 2023 catch up thing that's already happened?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, as you can imagine, it's somewhat linear with inflation, Ryan. So 2023, we had some record results of trying to keep up with the replacement costs and building materials. So it's down somewhat from 2023, but still up overall.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Ryan, as a macro comment, if you look at that exposure, it's easy to get very focused on recent periods. But if you look at that number over time, it's a pretty healthy number that I think is consistent with what is today a pretty healthy economy.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

If I can stick with property for a second, last year when we tracked renewal pricing changes, it sort of peaked in the second and third quarter.

Our field underwriters are going to look at the exposure at hand and the renewal book will change over time as we write incremental new business. And so overall, it's dependent on the exposures that come up for that particular quarter. That's more of the dynamic than any seasonality.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Meyer, it's Dan. I'll just add in case your question is not just seasonality of pure price change, but within the property line, there's some seasonality of its mix on a written premium basis. And to your point, and you can see it in the financial supplement, the second and third quarters tend to be relatively higher levels of commercial property compared to what comes up in Q1 and Q4.\n\nMeyers Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay, that's very helpful. Thank you. If I can switch gears, I wanted to talk a little bit about workers' compensation reserve releases because based on the statutory numbers, there were like 900 million of releases in 2023. And I think you said less than 100 this quarter. So that's slowing down. I was hoping you could maybe break that down either by accident year or the difference between actual claim emergence versus indications.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Meyer, it's Dan. So again, I'm going to resist the temptation to do it by accident year. It's multiple accident years in comp as it normally is. We're really just going through the same robust and disciplined review process every quarter in comp and in every line. We'll go through the latest data. We'll look at how it might have varied from what our actuarial models would have expected. And we'll do our best to determine the reasons why the actual varied from expected and book the necessary adjustments accordingly. And the number is just sort of going to be what it's going to be. And if you think about this quarter versus last quarter or this quarter versus next quarter in any particular line, prior reserve development might be more, might be less. We'll wait and see what the data tells us. But it's more of the same in terms of thematically what's coming through. We have continued to make assumptions around what long-term severity is going to be. We have assumptions around what frequency is going to be. And that of those things has been some more good news in the first part of this year.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nMeyer, I'll also add that as we, one part of our consideration process as we go through this is to make sure that we're appropriately reflecting our thoughts about uncertainty. So that's, just something to keep in mind.\n\nMeyers Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much."

On the, maybe question on the Business Insurance segment, when we look at the underlying combined ratio, it's, it's shown a nice trend of, I guess improvement versus prior years. And that's kind of despite you all kind of topping off IB&R and kind of adding to reserves on recent vintages. And so just curious about that dynamic, how is it that your view of kind of the underlying has stayed excellent kind of, and not kind of drifted a bit higher as you've taken some just small actions? Is it just pricing powers been, you think just much higher than loss cost trend or any color you have would be helpful?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nLet me, let me start and I'll turn it over to you, Dan. So we understand that sometimes the investment community can get very focused on a couple of metrics as you think about what drives it, but, but that's really not the way it comes together. It comes together through all the things that, that impact margins. And so, if you look at the excellent result this quarter earn pricing was a significant benefit favorable mix was a little bit of a benefit and there was some small items going the other way that that partially upset some of that benefit. As Dan mentioned, we booked a little bit more IB&R as a reflection of uncertainty, a little bit of non-CAT weather a little bit of discrete large loss activity none of those things significant and as you can tell from the fact that it was an excellent and improving number but every quarter there's there are just a bunch of factors that add up and puts and takes.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, that's right. And I think the only thing I\u2019d add to that and I'd sort of confirm your premise in the question Mike is it's really a very strong pricing environment if you go back and look at the i-commentary over the last year or two it's one of the reasons we've been so pleased to see retention remain as a strong as it has because we love the profile of the book and we're trying to, so we're happy to be retaining it, happy to get pricing on top of it and that's improving margins and then in any quarter it's going to be impacted by some of the things that Alan just mentioned.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay that's helpful. My last follow-up is on maybe more on homeowners' personal lines. Given the, what seems like continued trend of higher task losses, any changes you're seeing in the industry or the travelers trying to implement on terms and conditions such as roof replacement, are there any trends there we should be thinking about? Thanks.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Mike. It's Michael. Absolutely. I think if you, if you dig underneath our comments around non-rate actions, there's a variety of things that we're executing on, and many of which we're seeing across the industry. And examples include, first of all, eligibility, right, based on an evaluation of the exposure also eligibility on age of roof, underwriting restrictions around things like roof condition and tree overhang. Our primary approach on sort of risk sharing, if you will, is really to focus on AOP and wind-hail tornado deductibles. We've implemented higher wind-hail tornado deductibles in virtually every severe convective storm exposed state across the country. I think the last count were up to, I think, 21 states where we've increased deductibles to help to deal with the exposure. And then, managing distribution and managing appetite to manage aggregation of exposure, within a local or a state-by-state geography. So really, those are some examples of the variety of actions we're taking from a non-rate perspective, which is really what we're referring to when we talk about managing growth and improving profitability and property.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

And I'm wondering if any of the reforms that have been taking place in the past couple of years have given you pause to maybe revisit that?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. Great question and certainly something that we spend time evaluating. What I would say is certainly reforms in Florida, some of the depopulation of citizens in Florida are certainly things that make Florida look better than it has in the past. But it is still a highly CAT exposed geography. It is still a place where we think the risk-reward is not in balance. And one of the things, frankly, in Florida that remains a significant concern is the potential assigned risk obligation in the event of a significant catastrophe. And so, and I think Alan's referred to this in the past. We see signs of improvement in the state, but it's going to take more than what we've seen. And one of the things that it causes you to think about is whether or not you can compete in Florida on an admitted basis versus an excess and surplus lines basis. So those are all some of the considerations around Florida. The upshot for us is while we do see those signs of improvement, we haven't seen enough change to cause us to change our perspective on wanting to, reopen for new business and property in Florida.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, the TOR [ph] reforms that they enacted we think were an excellent start. We certainly love other states to follow suit because we think regulatory reform is important as it relates to affordability, not just insurance, but of home ownership and autos. But there are some other structural things in the state that are, just make it difficult at the moment. We'll continue to reevaluate it.\n\nMichael Phillips - Analyst (Oppenheimer):\nOkay, great. Thank you guys. Thanks for the color. Second question, personal auto. Are you seeing any sign there of kind of just higher attorney [ph] involvement in personal auto that give you [Indiscernible] concern?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nSure, Michael. I would say that, in Q1, it's, first of all, bodily injury is where most attorney involvement occurs. And in Q1, it's the longest tail element of the exposure we see in personal insurance. So concluding anything based on what we saw in the quarter from a bodily injury standpoint is a challenge. But the same, sort of social inflation, litigation, abuse challenges that Greg has talked about a lot in Business Insurance, we're not immune from in personal insurance. We have seen over a longer period of time increased attorney involvement impact bodily injury. But all that said, if we look at bodily injury results in the quarter, bodily injury loss trends were pretty consistent with what we expected.\n\nMichael Phillips - Analyst (Oppenheimer):"

I think most of the growth that happened from a net written premium change was due to RPC. One thing I would point out, and I referenced a little bit earlier, we do have our new automobile product that we've rolled out across all Business Insurance in our express select underwriting route model and also in our transactional middle market business, our TCAP [ph] product. So we feel, terrific about that latest segmentation and that should ultimately improve the return profiles on that business overall. But the biggest change was RPC.\n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nGreat. Thank you. And maybe just back to GL, you noted the charges were relatively modest. I guess just compared to last year's charges, are they similar, less, or any other color around that? Thanks.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Michael. It's Dan. I guess I'll say if you just look at the comment being that, comp was approaching 100 million, the segment was zero, some of it was runoff, you could get to an implication of sort of a box around how much the GL must have been. And for whatever it's worth, and I'm not sure how much it's worth, that would tell you that the first quarter number was probably less than some of the magnitude that we saw in last year. But again, we'll do a full evaluation again next quarter and the number will be more or less favorable or unfavorable depending on what the data tells us.\n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):"

Paul Newsome, your line is open.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nHi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just a couple of quick personalized questions. Is it fair to say that the renewal premium change for both auto and home, given what you've already filed and the fact that you're getting closer to or you've gotten most states to adequacy, that we should see that decelerate fairly meaningfully in the next couple of quarters? Just any thoughts about that so that we aren't surprised?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Paul. It's Michael. I would separate auto and home. For auto, you'll see RPC moderate as we go throughout the year. I wouldn't suggest it's going to be a sharp decline. One of the things that I think is important to think about as you think about RPC over time for us is we write mostly 12-month policies in auto. While someone who writes a lot of six-month policies is going to see RPC accelerate quickly on the front end, they're going to actually see it decelerate more quickly on the back end. Ours is going to be a more gradual increase and then a more gradual decrease because we file a rate in May of 2023. We're still renewing policies at that same higher rate in April of 2024. So just a little bit of context for why I say it's going to be more of a gradual deceleration in auto RPC. In property RPC, we don't anticipate a deceleration. We're going to continue to drive rate into the property portfolio in response to increased loss costs. I would expect RPC to remain relatively consistent through the balance of 2024 in property.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nI did notice that the renewal rate in home did come down quite a bit, at least sequentially. Is that just sort of an anomaly or is it something to note?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Paul. The RPC drop from Q4 to Q1 in property is what we were referring to last year when we talked about the fact that we've made a lot of progress on insurance to value in home. So when you think about renewal premium change in personal lines property, it's really driven by two primary things. One is rate and then the other is increasing the coverage limit on the dwelling. And in 2022 and 2023, we made dramatic increases in property coverage A limits in home that drove a decent amount of the property RPC. In my prepared remarks, that's why I mentioned that when you look at that 13.4%, it actually reflects improvement in rate from last quarter to this quarter. And the drop is really because we've essentially caught up on insurance to value in property. So that's why I say you're not going to see a further incremental change in RPC due to that coverage A limit dynamic because that's just going to stay the same. And now what you're looking at is mostly our outlook for rate in property for 2024, which again is to keep it pretty consistent.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):"

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer, and our three segment presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the investor section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to have generated a strong bottom line result in the quarter that included a record number of severe convective storms across the United States. Excellent underlying results, favorable net prior year reserve development, and higher net investment income contributed to core income of $585 million or $2.51 per diluted share. Underlying underwriting income of $1.2 billion pre-tax was up 55% over the prior year quarter. This year's exceptional result was driven by record net earned premiums of $10.2 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 87.7%. Net earned premiums were higher in all three of our business segments. The underlying combined ratio in our Business Insurance segment was an excellent 89.2%, and the underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. Looking at our two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 88.7% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved by nearly 8 points to a terrific 86.3%. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $11.1 billion in the quarter. Outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field across all three segments contributed to our top-line success. We are very pleased to report terrific production results in our commercial segments, where, as you've heard, margins are attractive. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.1%, while retention remained high at 85%. A combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined. New business increased 9% to a record $732 million, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In Bond & Specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums by 8% to more than $1 billion, driven by very strong retention of 90% in our high-quality management liability business, and excellent production in our market-leading surety business, where we grew net written premiums by 11%. At year-end 2023, we shared that across our two commercial segments, our E&S writings had reached $2.5 billion for the year, doubled the level from 2021. Year-to-date, we've grown E&S net written premiums by 16%. The margins continue to be quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, continued strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premiums with growth of 10% in auto and 8% in home. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $727 million, driven by strong and reliable terms from our growing fixed-income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our investment results benefit from the strong cash flow we've generated over a sustained period. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. This isn't a measure that we or the industry talk a lot about, but it's important. Cash flow is what enables us to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders, and grow our investment portfolio. Since 2016, we've invested $11 billion in important technology initiatives, returned more than $20 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, and grown our investment portfolio by more than $25 billion. It's a virtuous cycle as well-conceived and executed strategic initiatives, an effective capital management strategy, and a thoughtful investment strategy contribute to attractive returns and growth in adjusted book value per share. Strong underwriting is the flywheel that sets it all in motion. Thanks to exceptional franchise value and excellent marketplace execution, we've profitably grown our premium base from about $25 billion in 2016 to more than $40 billion today. Our growth over this period of time has been largely organic, selling products in which we have deep expertise through distribution partners with whom we have longstanding relationships, and in geographies where we have a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and other market dynamics. In other words, our competitive advantages have enabled us to effectively execute a relatively low-risk growth strategy. The success of that strategy is evidenced by a return on equity that has averaged about 900 basis points over the 10-year treasury over that period at industry-low volatility. What all this boils down to is steady consistent growth and adjusted book value per share after making important investments in our business and returning substantial excess capital to shareholders. And as a leader in the US PNC market with broad product capability, demonstrated success with innovation and plenty of market share headroom, we're confident there's a lot more opportunity in front of us. To sum it up, we continue to be very confident in the outlook for our business. Our results for the first half of the year include strong premium growth, an excellent bottom line result, record operating cash flow, and steadily rising investment returns in our growing fixed income portfolio. With a strong and diversified business and balance sheet, we delivered 13"

With a strong and diversified business and balance sheet, we delivered 13.6% core return on equity over the last 12 months, despite substantial industry-wide catastrophe losses. With this momentum, we remain well-positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an underlying combined ratio of 87.7%, a 340 basis point improvement from last year's strong result, and the third consecutive quarter below 88%. This led to one of our strongest ever underlying underwriting gains of $952 million after tax, up $337 million, or 55% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 28.8%, in line with our expectations and once again benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. We continue to expect 2024's full year expense ratio to be 28% to 28.5%. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter, and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, driven by a record number of severe convective storms. As disclosed in the significant events table in our 10-Q, we had five events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, all in the month of May. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $230 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $34 million resulted from approximately $300 million of better than expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years, largely offset by about $250 million of strengthening in general liability driven by Umbrella for accident years 2021 through 2023. In terms of the Umbrella line, these are very young accident years made up almost entirely of IBNR. While we will obviously continue to evaluate loss activity as it comes in, we believe we have been proactive and decisive in addressing the latest observed loss activity and adjusting our view of loss development factors to allow for the prospect of rising settlement costs and lengthening settlement patterns. Importantly, our picks for accident years 2015 through 2020 did not require much adjustment in the first half of this year. It's also worth noting that our returns in the Umbrella line for the impacted accident years remain attractive. As we saw five years ago, when we were the first to call out a change in loss levels tied to an increase in attorney rep rates, sharpening our view of loss costs early in the development of immature accident years and long tail lines positions us to enhance our risk selection, pricing, and claim strategies, ultimately setting us up to outperform in terms of growth and profitability. And on a related note, with court backlogs from the COVID shutdown now largely resolved, that element of uncertainty is, to a large degree, behind us. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was $24 million pre-tax. Personal Insurance had significant net favorable PYD of $172 million pre-tax with good news from recent accident years in both home and auto. After tax net investment income of $727 million, increased by 22% from the prior year quarter. As expected, fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also up from the prior year quarter. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, has increased slightly. We now expect approximately $675 million after tax in the third quarter and $695 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30th are still above the yields embedded in the portfolio. So fixed income NII should continue to improve beyond 2024 as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were, again, very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Interest rates increased during the quarter and, as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased modestly from $3.7 billion after tax at March 31st to $4 billion after tax at June 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $126.52 at quarter end, up 3% from year end, and up 10% from a year ago. We returned $498 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $253 million and dividends of $245 million. We have approximately $5.5 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Turning to reinsurance, Page 19 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1st reinsurance placements. We increased coverage when we renewed our Northeast property CAT XOL Treaty, which now provides $1 billion of coverage above the attachment point of $2.75 billion. A year ago, we purchased $850 million of coverage, and the attachment point was $2.5 billion. We also renewed the Personal Insurance hurricane cat excess of loss treaty for coastal exposure, which continues to provide 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $2 billion. Recapping our results, Q2 was another quarter of strong premium growth, excellent underlying underwriting profitability, and continued growth in net investment income, all of which bode well for our future returns. Our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pre-tax cat losses and still deliver $585 million of core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our diversified franchise and the fundamentals of our business. To give a little more color on that, underlying underwriting income has become an increasingly reliable and important component of our earnings power. Going back to the combination of Travelers in St. Paul, from 2005 through 2019, annual underlying underwriting income averaged $1.2 billion after tax. Our focus on profitable premium growth, which began accelerating around 2016, resulted in underlying underwriting income surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever in 2020. And we stayed above $2 billion through 2022. We then surpassed $3 billion in 2023. And through the first half of 2024, underlying underwriting income of just over $1.9 billion is up by 32% compared to the first half of 2023. In short, underlying underwriting income has become a significant and growing contributor to our ability to continue generating industry-leading returns with industry-low volatility. And now, for more color on each segment's results, I'll turn the call over to Greg to begin with a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter in terms of both top and bottom line results. Segment income was $656 million, up more than 60% from the prior year quarter, driven by prior year reserve development, higher net investment income, and higher underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2%, our best second quarter result ever. For modeling purposes, property losses for this quarter were about a point favorable to our expectations. Net written premiums increased 7% to an all-time second quarter high of more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1% with renewal rate change of 6.5% driving the majority of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 85% and new business was up 9% to a record quarterly high of $732 million. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels "

In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change, which was double digits for the fifth quarter in a row. The strong pricing was broad-based with renewal premium change in every line other than workers' comp at or pretty close to double digits. In terms of pure renewal rate change, we're pleased that the exceptional granular execution by our field organization reflects and appropriately balances the current return profile and environmental trends for each line. In terms of sequential rate movement from the first quarter, CMP, auto, umbrella, and workers comp all increased. Umbrella and auto led the way with double-digit rate increases. Renewal rate change in our property line moderated, driven by the National Property business, reflecting strong returns after several years of substantial compounding rate and improvements in terms and conditions. Even with these strong pricing levels, retention was improved or flat in every line other than property, where some large accounts in our National Property business in particular traded away to the subscription market this quarter on terms we weren't willing to accept. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was exceptionally high at 12.3% with the renewal rate change of 5.3%, up a point and a half from the first quarter and more than 2 points from the second quarter of last year. Retention remained healthy but ticked down a bit from recent periods to 83% as we begin to purposely optimize our risk return profile in a couple of targeted geographies and classes. New business remains strong and increased 8% from the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the impact that our production, product, and platform initiatives are having in the marketplace and building a high-quality mix of business and driving profitable growth in this market. In middle market, renewal premium change remains strong and consistent with recent levels at almost 10%. Renewal rate change of 7% was up more than a point from the second quarter of last year and has now been at or around the 7% mark for the fourth consecutive quarter. Retention also remained strong at 89%. A new business of $383 million was the highest ever second quarter result. Lastly, fresh off my most recent round of field visits, I couldn't be more pleased with our team's execution, ideation, energy, and enthusiastic adoption of the tools and capabilities that have come from the strategic investments we've been making. And our distribution partners were once again crystal clear about our team's value and shared many examples of how our local teams, the best in the business, distinguished themselves. These trips continue to highlight for me the value of our high-performing talent in training curriculums, as well as the dividends we are receiving from our investments to be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $170 million and a strong combined ratio of 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. The underlying loss ratio improved 4.1 points to an excellent 46.4%, reflecting the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the prior year quarter from a small number of surety accounts. As we discussed last quarter, the expense ratio is modestly elevated primarily due to the Corvus acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for a few more quarters as we integrate the operation and as premiums from Corvus attractive book of business ramp up and earn in. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% in the quarter to a record high. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90% with positive renewal premium change that is generally consistent with recent quarters. We're pleased that we grew new business by nearly 60% from the prior year quarter to a record $111 million driven by Corvus. As a reminder, all of Corvus production will continue to be reflected in new business through next quarter. We grew net written premiums in our market leading surety business by a terrific 11% in the quarter, reflecting a robust construction environment and continued strong demand for our surety products and services. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, an excellent underlying underwriting result and strong net favorable prior year reserve development drove a significantly improved bottom line result relative to the prior year quarter, despite another period of elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 86.3% reflects nearly an 8 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and homeowners and other. Continued strong price increases in both auto and home drove 9% growth in net written premiums. In auto, we're pleased with another quarter of improved profitability and with the underlying fundamentals of the business. The second quarter combined ratio of 97.9% improved more than 10 points compared to the prior year quarter due to a lower underlying combined ratio as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio improved more than 8 points, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing and to a lesser extent lower losses from physical damage coverages. For modeling purposes, we view roughly 2.5 points of the improvement in the quarter as non-recurring. In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio improved over 16 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as higher favorable prior year development. While catastrophe loss dollars were similar to the prior year quarter, they had a smaller combined ratio impact as price increases continue to benefit earned premiums. Catastrophe losses this quarter, primarily resulting from severe convective storms, again significantly exceeded long-term industry averages. The 28 PCS designated cat events were the most ever for a second quarter and 150% of the historical 10-year average. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were consistent with our market share. And for context, our average annual cat losses over the last five and 10 years remain below our market chart. This most recent experience will of course be reflected in our models going forward and we will continue to weigh our recent experience more heavily in our ongoing process of optimizing our exposure, underwriting, and pricing. The underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved 7.6 points, due in large part to lower than expected fire and non-weather water losses, as well as the benefit of earned pricing. For modeling purposes, we expect approximately 5 points of the improvement in the homeowners and other underlying combined ratio to be nonrecurring. Turning to production, our results reflect the ongoing execution of a granular state-by-state strategy as we balance profitability and growth across the portfolio. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remains strong. Renewal premium change of 15.8% continued to moderate as anticipated. Auto renewal premium change will continue to gradually decline, reflecting the improved profitability on the line. While new business premiums were higher than the prior year quarter in many states, new business premium in aggregate was down slight"

While new business premiums were higher than the prior year quarter in many states, new business premium in aggregate was down slightly relative to the second quarter of last year. This is the result of our continued efforts to manage auto profitability in a few remaining challenge states, as well as the cross-line impact resulting from some of our property actions, particularly in high-risk cat areas. Production results in homeowners and other reflect our focus to manage growth, while improving profitability. Renewal premium change increased sequentially to 15.1%, reflecting higher rate change, while retention remains strong at 85%. We expect renewal premium change to remain at this level through year end. As we intended, new business and policies enforced declined, reflecting our efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity. To sum up for the Personal Insurance segment overall, we're pleased with our progress as we continue to deliver improved profitability.

Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nThanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the moving pieces around reserves in Business Insurance. So just the $250 million of recent accident year umbrella charges. That comes after $100 million last quarter. So I guess I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on some of the more puts and takes and maybe give some confidence that you've put this behind you after the changes you made this quarter.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, David, it's Dan. So you're right. We've seen umbrella in the general liability lines require some strengthening in the last few quarters. As we said in prepared remarks, we think that we're being proactive in reacting early and being decisive in meaning that we're being reasonably comprehensive in a meaning -- by reacting in a meaningful way to what we're seeing. I think the confidence we have is two pieces. One is, we are reacting both to the changes in actual versus expected and allowing for longer development factors going forward on the very recent accident years. So for the most part, we haven't even seen these claims come in yet, but we are allowing for the fact that when claims come in, they're likely going to cost more and take longer to settle. And then I think importantly, the 2015 through 2020 period has held up pretty well, given the actions that we had taken through the end of 2023.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Okay. And maybe also within Business Insurance, the underlying loss ratio, if I sort of adjust out the light non-cat weather this quarter and then in 2Q 2023, there still was around 50 basis points of improvement year-over-year on a clean basis. Could you talk about, I guess, what was driving that improvement? And especially given all these changes, was there any change to loss trend baked in there?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, David, it's Dan again. So I'll take that. So I'll start with the second part first. So every time we have an impact on PYD, we reevaluate, is that going to have an impact on current loss year, jump off point, or loss trend. We had said last quarter that we had added beginning last quarter some IBNR to the current accident year. So we had already taken some action. The changes that we made in PYD have some carry forward impact on the umbrella line, but there's puts and takes across a variety of lines. And when you blend them all together inside of Business Insurance, it did not result in a big movement. In terms of the overall movement in BI's underlying loss ratio, you've got the big parts. There's still some benefit from earned pricing. Greg called out the fact that property losses, other than cat, were about a point favorable than our expectations. Other than that, in any quarter, you're going to have a half a dozen things that move favorably or unfavorably from mixed to base year to the impact of reinsurance, and you're seeing the net of those things. Nothing significant in there in terms of those individual movements.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

And then, maybe just a little bit more following up on David's question, like, what emerged, I guess, in the Q2 more than what you saw in the Q1 to think that you put this issue to bed that we're not going to be dealing with additional charges as we go through the balance of this year?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Elyse, it's Dan.

And what I'm focused on is your competitive positioning. If I look at the year-to-date top lines results, kind of seeing some movements that I'm surprised by. I guess seeing national accounts grow as much as they did on a year-to-date basis kind of seems like it's counterintuitive. You expect the larger account business to be more competitive. And then on the selective middle market, I kind of anticipate maybe that to be higher growth areas for you from a net premium written perspective. So maybe you can provide some colors on that topic.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nSo Greg, it's Dan. I'll start, and maybe Greg will chime in. So national accounts, on a relative basis, in terms of its contribution to Business Insurance in total, not the biggest piece, and its large accounts. So how many you retain -- you could lose one account in a quarter and that has a big impact on retention. You could write one new big new piece of business. That's going to change the premium base. So I'd say two things about national accounts. One, we're really happy with the profitability of that book. Two, I'm not surprised to see the variability given: one, that it's a relatively small base; and that two, the accounts themselves tend to be big. In terms of selecting middle, look, we love the performance of both of those businesses. Greg did make comments in his script about some refinement of the way we're thinking about underwriting in small commercial. Middle market, margins are really good, 8% growth. We're very happy on how we focused on the balance of retention and price where we need it. But I don't know, Greg, anything to add to that?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Greg, maybe just start with the bigger picture, the total business. 7% is a really good result given the attractive margins in this business right now. And you pointed out some of the individual business units. When you look at them from quarter-to-quarter, a number of items can have some level of variation, including booking lags, reinsurance processing, things that Dan just referenced. But in terms of the aggregate results, I'd point you as close as they are, the quarter to year to date, I'd point you to the year to date number, as that's a better indicator of how we're feeling about the top line of the business right now.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nFair enough. I guess for my follow-up question, I'm going to pivot to the Personal Insurance segment. And Michael, I appreciate your comments about the challenge to the states and trying to get the right positioning and pricing for your auto product. One of the largest and most visible peers seems to be really gaining share at this moment in time in the personal auto space. And I guess, when I look at your policy for in-force count going down, both in the first and second quarter, I'm just curious if you think your competitive positioning in personal auto is consistent with what's going on in the marketplace.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, Greg, I think it's a great question. I would say, to your point about is it consistent with what's going on in the marketplace, it's interesting. The one peer you're talking about is the one peer with those results, not everybody else inclusive of us. So I would take a step back first of all and say, certainly kudos to them and the results they're generating and the success that they're having, but it's really not us who's the outlier. And then underneath that, I think, again, I tried to detail it for you. We are having success in the geographies that I'll say are the ones that aren't noisy and generating new business growth in those places where we like the auto margins and we're not impacted by some of the property actions, number one. That growth is, if you just look at the auto line by itself, being hampered by those challenged geographies. And then I also think that it's important to think about the differences in our strategy and our book of business when you look at our auto growth numbers, right? We are predominantly a package writer of personal lines business. The competitor that's growing auto is not predominantly a package writer of personal lines business. And when you look at the challenge of geographies from a property standpoint and you look at the independent agent channel, what you find in the marketplace is that, in many of those geographies in order to write the property, the carrier is insisting on also writing the auto. And so, if you are a competitor that's less dependent on auto business that brings property with it, you're not as challenged by those marketplace dynamics in those high-risk property geographies. So those are -- I think those are some of the things that explain the differences. But again, I would come back and say we're very pleased with our ability to generate auto new business growth in the places where we're not challenged by those factors. The other thing is, if you were to look underneath the new business growth numbers, first of all, you can see in aggregate auto new business growth is much better than property new business growth. And particularly, in those challenged geographies from a property standpoint, our auto new business is down, but it's not down nearly as much as the property new business in those geographies.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAnd Greg, I would just point out at a very high level. Michael points out some distinguishing characteristics of our Personal Insurance business, there are some significant benefits from that business model. I mean, obviously, it's having the impact it's having on growth, but there are some significant offsetting benefits to that business model, and we're well on the way to sorting this out.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

So, if you look at the reinsurance detail we gave at the January 1 renewals and now again at July 1 renewals, we're not really holding onto more. We tend to buy more tail coverage on big cat events. The attachment points have gone up, but the attachment points have gone up naturally as a result of the growth in the premium base and the growth of the insured values.

What you're looking at when you look at our renewal premium change number and many renewal premium change numbers across the industry is the lagged effect of the rate that's already been taken. When we look at filing activity for ourselves and for others, you see a much less significant amount of rate filing this time this year than you would have seen this time last year. And so again, what you're seeing in renewal premium change in auto is the lagged impact of that. In terms of your question about advertising, certainly we see increased advertising amongst some of our competitors who are big advertisers across the industry. In marketplaces where we bid for demand, where we bid for leads. We see the prices of those leads going up. That's reflective of that increased advertising spend and that increased appetite for leads. But I think that both of those things, I think, demonstrate that what you're seeing is improved profitability in auto across the industry and a pivot towards profitable growth very consistent with the conversation and the messaging that we're sharing."

I guess for Michael, you're right to point out that the property declines are greater than the auto declines. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether there's non-renewals of customers who you no longer want given their geographies or whether it's pricing actions that are driving those customers away? When we look at the policy count changes in homeowners, what's driving them?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Josh. The biggest driver of the policy count decline in homeowners is the reduction in new business. You see where the retention holding relatively steady. And so for the most part, new business production being down is what's driving the [PIF] (ph) decline. I'll also say that, sort of consistent with my comments earlier, the new business reduction in the cat challenged states is down more significantly than the new business reduction you see in the production highlights as we work to manage the distribution of our property exposure. There is some limited non-renewal activity that I would say is really twofold. One is normal course, good hygiene, evaluating the worst performing risks in the portfolio and taking action on them. The other is, some targeted non-renewals, again, as we manage the geographic distribution of our exposures and manage growth in some higher concentration, higher cat geographies. But again, those actions are all intentional and the new business reductions, as I said in my prepared remarks, really are as intended as part of our efforts to improve profitability.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd then a quick question on catastrophe. It's been quite a decade in terms of catastrophe losses. While you've made changes over time, you were a cat [indiscernible] pretty consistent. You like the risk and you only have protection really at the top for very extreme events. A broken clock is right twice a day in hindsight 2020, but looking at the last 10 years, has the cat program at Travelers been the most efficient use of your capital? And when you revisit, say that this is exactly what we need to do for the next 10 years?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nJosh, I think we're very comfortable with being a net underwriter. We think that we've got the data, the analytics, the culture to manage this the right way. And you can't expect a reinsurer to take on losses without conveying a margin to them. And so, when we look at the strength of our underwriting, we think that there's a real advantage for us in being largely a net underwriter.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

First of all, I guess with what you're seeing in Umbrella, is it safe to assume that the underlying cause of a lot of those losses you're seeing is mostly auto-related? That's the first part. And then the second part, I remember like six years ago in 2019, you guys experienced some of this earlier than others. Is there something about your small middle market, your writing lower limits, that there's a little bit less of a tail. So just to make sure your business kind of experiences some of the inflationary impacts you've seen from 2021 to 2023 faster.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nHey Ryan, let me start there. So in terms of what we're seeing, no, it's not -- actually not a predominantly auto issue. This is a combination of economic inflation and social inflation driving claim activity into the Umbrella line in short. And economic inflation sort of speaks for itself. Social inflation, it's an aggressive plaintiff's bar. It's third-party litigation funding. It's sympathetic jury. It's the exact same constellation of factors we've been talking about, just a little bit more pronounced. In terms of our ability to see it sooner, I honestly don't think it's a function of our book of business or our limits or anything else. I think it's a function of our data, our analytics, and really importantly, our culture. We've got a culture that looks for this, that sees it. We've got a very, very important and very valuable feedback loop among our claims professionals, our pricing actuaries, our reserving actuaries, and our underwriters that can put together a story very, very quickly. And it's actually a competitive advantage. As Dan highlighted in his prepared remarks, the ability to sharpen a view of lost costs very, very early in the life of immature long-tail lines is a huge advantage. It's a difference on whether you're subject to adverse selection or inflicting adverse selection. And we think this positions us very well. Again, it's very, very early. These years are predominantly IBNR. And the returns that we're looking at in those years actually continues to be very attractive. So I get the interest in it. Believe me, we're interested in it, too. But our ability to see this and react to it really is a competitive advantage for Travelers.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nGot it. Then I guess just to follow up. I think Greg mentioned lower retention in select accounts. I heard the word geography. I mean, to the extent that you are seeing elevated cats in commercial lines, I'd be curious if you guys think you are. Is that more of a small commercial issue or if not, is it kind of more middle market or a national account?\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nHey, Ryan, this is Greg. Yes, we're not seeing cats disproportionately across any of the business units in Business Insurance. And it's just our normal good housekeeping and selected that we're going through and looking at the book of business and understanding parts of it where we need to get a better risk return profile. And folks certainly aren't going to share the individual geographies as that's market sensitive, but that's what's going on underneath that statement.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nIt's the kind of optimizing we do in every business every day.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

First one, there was some legislation in Florida, I guess, that passed in June that talked about Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors that will affect workers' comp. I'm just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about how that would affect comp, pricing and loss cost severity trends. And is that something you see continuing throughout the US?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nBrian, what I would say about workers' comp loss trend is that, we continue to look at it based on long-term basis and frequency and severity both continue to emerge favorable to our expectations. So there's nothing we're seeing out there that's necessarily adversely impacting that perspective, but it's a long-tailed line and we're going to have a lot of respect for the duration of the liability.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nAnd Brian, in terms of any specific state change that you mentioned, our product managers are looking at that at the state level. They're estimating what some of the bills and changes are. And we factor that in the pricing over time as we see those trends come in. So if there's a new reg out there and we think it's meaningful, we certainly are going to take an estimate at that and how it plays out in the marketplace.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nTerrific. Thanks. And Alan, second question is, you all have seen some great growth in your E&S capabilities and clearly seems like you're building those out. I'm just curious, you've typically been known as kind of the largest standard commercial and admitted market player in the US. Why kind of the sudden change, or not sudden change, but that kind of gradual change in strategy here toward more focus on the E&S markets? And do you think this continues here for the Travelers that E&S will become a larger and larger percentage of your overall, call it, commercial business mix?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nSo Brian, we are predominantly a standard lines writer and we will continue to be that for the foreseeable future. We're not changing any stripes here and we've had substantial E&S capability for a very long time. So, for a long time a lot of our National Property business has been written on E&S paper. We've got our Northfield E&S business. We've got our Lloyd's business, some of what we do, in our Bond & Specialty business is written on E&S paper. So it's been a capability that we've had for a long time. And there have been ebbs and flows of business in and out of E&S for a long time. And so, part of this is what's been flowing into it and our ability to capture it. In addition, as we've seen an attractive E&S opportunity, we've leaned into it a little bit. So think what we've done with Fidelis and our acquisition of Corvus, and those have been contributors too. So this isn't a changing of strides by any stretch of the imagination, but there's an opportunity out there and we're participating in it at very attractive margins.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, helpful.

And we'll see over time whether there's any significant impact at all from Chevron. I mean, I hesitate to speculate on that at all and maybe it depends on who the regulators are in place and how that changes from one administration to the next. But I'm trying to decide whether I want to answer this off the top of my head or not, because it's not something that we've really rung our hands over. But if you imagine that regulatory activity is a contributor to loss activity, the impact of that decision on the Chevron document, you'd expect might be a good guy, frankly. But I think it's too early for us to make that call.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, fair enough. The second question, I guess, this is for Michael. When you look at the sort of potential outcomes for non-catastrophe weather and catastrophe losses, do you think of those as being inversely related or unrelated?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nMeyer, I think it depends on the quarter. The non-cat weather in Personal Insurance sometimes will see a benefit because much of the weather gets classified as a cat. That actually was the case in the second quarter of last year. That was less so the case this year. When we talked about the underlying result this quarter, I talked about the fact that it was really fire and non-weather water losses, just to put a point on it and really didn't talk about non-cat weather, because in this quarter, it really -- we had both elevated catastrophes and we had about what we expected from a non-cat weather standpoint. So, in some cases, you'll see a little bit of an inverse relationship depending upon sort of the footprint of the weather and how significant the events are. But they're not always inversely related or directly related for that matter.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nI mean, it was a little bit of a factor of force this quarter in Business Insurance. Not huge, but it did have that impact this quarter. And so, when we do think about our weather, obviously, we're managing it as one, but there's a lot of what we would report favorably or unfavorably in small weather that you would see in the catastrophe line of some of our peers.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, that's perfect.

Just stepping back and thinking about the competitive environment in commercial lines, maybe a little more focused on Business Insurance, but maybe not. Would you expect current pricing power trends and maybe for the industry to kind of be stable? Or would you expect kind of an upward sloping trend if indeed Travelers is kind of ahead of others in terms of being proactive on loss trends, especially on the casualty side.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nMike, I think we're going to try very hard not to give outlook on pricing. But I will say that from here, we would expect renewal price change continue to be positive and strong and in particular, driven by casualty. Now, whether that means up a little bit or down a little bit in one line or another. I don't really know. But I would say we expect it to remain relatively strong. There's a lot of uncertainty out there and you've heard from others about their experience in the casualty lines. As we look at the schedule P's, honestly, we expect there to be more of that coming from the industry. When we look at our position relative to the industry position, we would expect there to be more coming from the industry. So I would say positive and strong, particularly driven by casualty.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. Quick follow-up, and I wish there was a live transcript if there's not because of this global IT issue, but I feel Dan, you made some prepared remarks that were a bit longer and you talked about kind of underlying profitability and consistency. Is there can you unpack what was the -- what was the message you were trying to convey to us and investors? Are you trying to tell us to focus kind of more on the underlying loss ratio and less on kind of PYD levels or am I misunderstanding what you meant by that?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nMike, so thanks for listening. I think the main gist was sort of there was a period of time where underlying underwriting income was a pretty steady level. And it was a long period of time. And that was a period of time when written premium growth was sort of ticking around low single digits for a fair amount of time. And then when we started to accelerate the rate of top line growth again around 2016, and did it at consistent margins. The point was, that just translated into a much bigger base of pretty reliable underlying underwriting income. You can't quite go so far as to say it's just going to come in like the tide, but you look at the last five years where we -- before 2020, we had never reached $2 billion in after-tax underlying underwriting income. We crossed $2 billion in 2020 and stayed there. Then we crossed $3 billion in 2023. And in the first half of the year, we're up 30-something percent compared to that. So it was -- I sometimes think that people don't think of us as having grown, but really the underlying earnings power of the franchise is just in a completely different ballpark than it was five or six years ago.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nAnd that's the important point, Mike. When you look at the various things that impact the bottom line, underlying underwriting income has been a much bigger, much more reliable contributor to that. And when you think about the earnings power of the Travelers, that's an important contributor. And, well, I'll leave it at that.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

That's where I'm trying to get to.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes. So, I mean, we've had favorable development in the workers' comp line for many, many, many quarters now. And I don't know what it's going to be next quarter or the quarter after that, but I can tell you that we continue to feel positively about the balance sheet reserves sitting behind the workers' comp book. In terms of frequency and severity, look, frequency has been on a long-term secular decline. And, again, we're not going to project where that's necessarily going, but it's been on a long-term secular decline that the pandemic and the work from home that's followed it, it's probably too early to make a call on it, but at the margins, that's been probably positive. And if people came back to work and it ticked up a little bit, that wouldn't be particularly troubling for us because as we think about where frequency and severity go from here, as we've always done given the duration of the liability, we are very respectful of those two things. And so we continue to book frequency and severity as if it's going to go back to long-term trends. And so, we feel fine about the line and where lost trend is and where it could go."

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Head of Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski, Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then, we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our prepared remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by acknowledging the devastation caused by recent hurricanes Helene and Milton. These were powerful storms and our hearts go out to all those who have been impacted. Of course, we send our thoughts and prayers, but we're also sending claim resources. From our national catastrophe center in Hartford, we're managing the deployment of hundreds of Travelers claim professionals, along with mobile claim offices and quick response vehicles. We've activated thousands more cross-trained colleagues across the country to support our local response. Our catastrophe response model enables us to adjust virtually every claim with the Travelers claim professional. And without resorting to independent adjusters, that results in a better outcome for our customers and distribution partners. Thanks to these efforts in the advanced analytics and geospatial tools that we leverage. We're on track this year to meet our objective of resolving 90% of our claims from natural catastrophes within 30 days. That can make the difference between whether a customer of ours is able to celebrate the holiday season in their living room instead of a hotel room. I'd also like to express my deep gratitude to our claim organization. The entire team tirelessly delivers exceptional technical expertise and support to our customers, demonstrating day-in and day-out, the value of the travelers promise. Turning to results. We are very pleased to have generated outstanding top and bottom line results this quarter. Excellent underlying underwriting income, higher net investment income and net favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed to core income, of more than $1.2 billion or $5.24 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 16.6%. Underlying underwriting income of $1.5 billion pre-tax was up 73% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $10.7 billion, up 10% and an underlying combined ratio that improved 5 points to an excellent 85.6%. Both underwriting income and underlying margins were strong in all three of our segments. The underlying combined ratio in our Business Insurance segment improved nearly 2 points to an excellent 87.9%. And our Bond & Specialty business delivered a very strong underlying combined ratio of 85.6%. The underline combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved 11.5 points to an exceptional 82.7%. These terrific segment results contributed to a reported consolidated combined ratio that improved nearly 8 points to 93.2%. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, with after-tax net investment income up 16% to $742 million, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 4% during the quarter, and that's after returning $496 million of excess capital to shareholders and continuing to make important investments in our business. As we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $11.3 billion. The strong value proposition that we offer to our customers and distribution partners, along with outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 9% to more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment remained very strong, increasing to 10.5%, driven by strong contributions from the liability coverages. Renewal rate change accelerated to 7.3% in the quarter, and was steady or higher in every product line. Even with the firm pricing environment, retention in the segment ticked up to 86%. The combination of strong pricing and excellent retention reflects our deliberate execution and a marketplace that is reacting in a generally disciplined way to the headwinds of social and economic inflation. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to a record $1.1 billion, driven by excellent retention of 90% in our high quality management liability business and strong production in our market-leading surety business. We grew surety net written premiums by 7% from a very strong result in the prior year quarter. We are very pleased to have generated terrific production results across our commercial segments, where margins continue to be attractive. That includes our E&S offerings, where we've grown net written premiums by 13% year-to-date. In Personal Insurance, we were pleased to grow net written premiums by 7%, driven by strong renewal price change in both auto and home. The strong production results across our three segments are a reflection of our view that in order to achieve our objective of industry-leading returns over time, we need an effective strategy to grow profitably over time. As we've shared before, we seek to achieve profitable growth by investing in franchise value, making sure that we offer the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. Also central to our growth strategy is our very granular approach to risk selection, underwriting and pricing, which we've discussed many times. As a result of that approach and investments we've made over decades in leading data and analytics, our growth in insured exposures correlates to returns"

As a result of that approach and investments we've made over decades in leading data and analytics, our growth in insured exposures correlates to returns. In other words, generally speaking, the more attractive the returns in the business, the more we've been growing insured exposures in that business, all of which is to say, Travelers unique combination of franchise value and execution yields very effective capital deployment, a high-quality, profitable growth. The numbers speak for themselves. Over the last four years, we've grown our premium base by more than $13 billion, nearly a 50% increase while simultaneously improving our underwriting margins. The result is that we've more than doubled our underlying underwriting income and increased our total underwriting income by more than 80%. The combination of strong underwriting income and the reliable investment income from our substantial and growing investment portfolio makes for a powerful earnings engine. That's what's driving our strong results this quarter and year-to-date, and that's what's driving our core return on equity of 15.9% over the last 12 months. And that's what gives us great confidence in the outlook for our business into 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. I'm pleased to provide some additional color on an exceptionally strong quarter. Core income for the third quarter was $1.2 billion, and core return on equity was 16.6%. As we delivered another quarter of excellent underlying underwriting results, net favorable prior year reserve development and strong investment income. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent combined ratio of 93.2%, an improvement of nearly 8 points. Inside of that, our underlying combined ratio improved 5 full points from last year's strong results. This combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to our best ever underlying underwriting gain of $1.2 billion after tax, up $503 million or 74% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 28.4% and reflects the benefits of our continued focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. That brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.6%, in line with our expectations. Our third quarter results include $939 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, more than half of which relates to Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm, which made landfall in the last few days of the quarter. For travelers, the financial impact of Helene was greater in Georgia and the Carolinas than in Florida. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $126 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, the annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $242 million. Ex-asbestos, Business Insurance had net favorable PYD of $151 million, driven by favorability in workers' comp. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by another quarter of better-than-expected results in fidelity and surety. Personal Insurance had $181 million of net favorable PYD with favorability in both home and auto. After-tax net investment income of $742 million was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter and in line with our previously shared outlook. Reflecting the benefit of both higher average yields and significant growth in the portfolio. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, we now expect approximately $700 million after-tax for the fourth quarter. For 2025, we expect approximately $2.9 billion after-tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $700 million in the first quarter of 2025 and growing to approximately $760 million for the fourth quarter. Turning to capital management. We generated our strongest ever level of quarterly operating cash flows at $3.9 billion. Bringing the year-to-date figure above $7 billion, also our strongest ever September year-to-date results. Interest rates decreased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $4 billion after-tax at June 30th, to $2.1 billion after-tax at September 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $131.30 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end and up 13% from a year ago. We returned $496 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $253 million and dividends of $243 million. We have approximately $5.3 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. While it obviously did not impact our third quarter results, let me make a quick comment on Hurricane Milton. It's still early days in terms of assessing our ultimate losses, but at this point, we have a preliminary range of between $75 million and $175 million of pre-tax losses net of reinsurance. To sum things up, our third quarter and year-to-date results illustrate the fundamental earnings power that has resulted from our multi-year focus on growth at attractive margins and our rock-solid balance sheet. In addition to best ever levels of net written premium and net earned premium, our diversified portfolio of businesses delivered a terrific underwriting result, thanks to our best ever underlying combined ratio clearly demonstrating that we are positioned for success even during periods of weather volatility, like, we and the industry have experienced. In fact, despite having absorbed the highest ever level of catastrophe losses for the first-nine months of the year, our September year-to-date core earnings per share of $12.43 is a record high. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter in terms of both top and bottom line results. Segment income for the third quarter was $698 million, up about 50% from the prior year quarter, driven by improved prior year development and higher underlying underwriting income. The combined ratio of 95.8% was strong and improved from the prior year quarter by more than 3 points. Similar to the past several quarters, we're extremely pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 87.9%, which improved by about 2 points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit of earned pricing. This was our best third quarter underlying result ever. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 9% to an all-time third quarter high of more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.5%, with renewal retains that increased nearly 1 point sequentially and to 7.3%, driving the majority of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 86%, and a new business of $680 million was the second highest third quarter result ever, just slightly trailing last year's record third quarter. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change, which increased sequentially from the second quarter. Strong pricing was broad-based with renewal premium change at or close to double-digits in every line other than workers' comp. With respect to pure renewal rate change, we're pleased with the exceptional granular execution by our field organization reflects and appropriately balances the current return profile and environmental trends for each line. Umbrella and Auto continue to lead the way with rate increases well into double-digits. In terms of sequential renewal rate change, every line was at or higher than the second quart"

In terms of sequential renewal rate change, every line was at or higher than the second quarter. Even with these strong pricing levels, retention remains strong, as I mentioned earlier, a reflection of marketplace discipline in the face of industry headwinds. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 12.3%, up almost 2.5 points from the third quarter of last year. Renewal rate change of 5.5% was up sequentially from the second quarter and up more than 2.5 points from last year's third quarter. Retention tick down as we continue to intentionally optimize our CMP risk return profile in a couple of targeted geographies. New business was healthy and near historical highs. Overall, we remain pleased with the granular pricing and underwriting execution, driving profitable growth in Select. In middle market, renewal premium change was exceptionally strong at 10.6%, about 1 point higher than the second quarter, driven by renewal rate change, which reached 8%. The rate increases were broad-based with more than three quarters of our middle market accounts achieving positive rate change. And at the same time, the granular execution was excellent with meaningful spread from our best performing accounts to our lower performing accounts. We're pleased that retention also remained exceptionally even with these levels of price increases. Lastly, new business of $364 million was our highest ever third quarter result. And we're pleased with the risk selection and the strength of pricing on the accounts that we added to the portfolio. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial and production results, while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President of Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $222 million and an excellent combined ratio of 82.5%. We also delivered a very strong 85.6% underlying combined ratio in the quarter. The increase of 4.9 points from last year's quarter reflects a modestly elevated expense ratio, primarily related to the Corvus acquisition and the impact of earned pricing. We expect the expense ratio to remain elevated for a few more quarters as we integrate Corvus' operation and as we ramp up and earn in premiums from its attractive book of business. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter to a record high $1.1 billion. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, with positive renewal premium change that reflects terrific execution by our field organization and our focus on retaining our profitable book of business. We're pleased that we grew new business by over 80% from the prior year quarter, to a record $113 million, driven by Corvus. Nine months following the closing of our Corvus acquisition, we continue to feel terrific about the talent, capabilities and business that we've added to our cyber portfolio. We're deploying Corvus' proprietary underwriting and risk control capabilities across our Cyber book, helping our customers remediate vulnerabilities and avoid cyber losses. Our distribution partners have endorsed our go-to-market strategy, which includes both admitted and excess and surplus lines cyber offerings. And realizing the benefit of our high-quality travelers paper and brand, we've considerably improved Corvus' legacy renewal retention. In short, we couldn't be more pleased with the addition of the Corvus team to the Travelers family. Turning to our market-leading surety business. We grew net written premiums by 7% from a very strong level in the prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our surety products and services and outstanding execution by our team, and growing our high credit quality portfolio. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter in Bond & Specialty Insurance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, which continue to reflect the positive impact of our rate and non-rate actions across the portfolio. In the quarter, we delivered significantly improved segment income of $384 million and a combined ratio of 92.5%, driven by excellent underlying -- by an excellent underlying underwriting results and strong net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 82.7% reflects an 11.5 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of earned pricing in both auto and home, as well as favorable non-catastrophe weather. Continued strong price increases drove 7% growth in net written premiums as we continue our focus on improving profitability in property, while seeking profitable growth in auto. In auto, we're pleased with another quarter of improved profitability. The third quarter combined ratio was very strong at 93.4% despite 4.9 points of catastrophe losses, primarily related to Hurricane Helene. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2% improved 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement continues to be driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing and lower losses from physical damage coverages. This quarter's underlying underwriting -- this quarter's underlying result also included a 2 point benefit related to the re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year. Taking a step back, the year-to-date underlying combined ratio of 93.7% reflects considerable progress and is compelling evidence of our return to profitability in auto. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, it is important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been about 6 points to 7 points above the average for the first-three quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving. In Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 91.5% improved by nearly 25 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as lower catastrophe losses and higher favorable prior year development. Hurricane Helene and a severe convective storm in July drove catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 74.4% improved 13.6 points compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately three quarters of the year-over-year favorability was related to non-catastrophe weather and non-weather losses. The benefit of earned pricing also contributed to the improvement. Turning to production. Our results reflect our ongoing efforts to balance profitability and growth across the portfolio. We're pleased with our progress, as we execute a very granular state-by-state strategy. In domestic auto, retention of 83% remained strong. Renewal premium change of 12.8% continued to moderate as intended. Renewal premium change will continue to decline, reflective of improved auto profitability. Auto new business premiums continue to reflect our success in achieving positive auto growth in many states. While auto new business premium was down slightly in total, the decline reflects our focus on auto profitability in a few remaining challenging states and the cross-line impact of our actions to manage property exposure in high risk cat geographies. We're comfortable with this trade-off in the near term and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our portfolio over time. In Homeowners and Other, retention of 85% and renewal premium change"

Your line is open.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. Good morning, everyone. So I guess for the first question, I'll focus on domestic business insurance and the renewal premium change, which continues to be quite strong even through the third quarter. I guess, where I'm going with this is, given the strong improvement in the underlying results, at what point will that renewal premium change begin to moderate?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Greg. Good morning. It's Alan. Thanks for the question. We're not going to try to forecast what that's going to be. But I would say, there are headwinds out there in terms of inflation. There is uncertainty out there in terms of the political and regulatory environment, the geopolitical environment, so on and so forth. So I'll share that with you as the kind of things we think some of the market is reacting to, but we're not going to project it.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. Fair enough. I thought, I\u2019d give it a shot. I guess the other question, listening to the comments about the strong results, the best third quarter ever in business insurance, etc. and the free cash flow. I guess, I want to pivot back to capital management. I know you're not going to disclose M&A on the call, but it seems like a balanced approach, including capital return to shareholders and M&A, or investment in organic is a high likelihood that could happen. But considering the cash flow numbers, should we just plow that all on the share repurchase or what are you thinking?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYeah, Greg, I'll just tell you philosophically for every single dollar of capital that we generate, our first priority is to invest it back in the business in whatever way we can do that to create shareholder value. Whether that's organic growth, investing in talent or capabilities, products, etc., or whether it\u2019s inorganic. So that\u2019s our first objective, and we try to do that. But it\u2019s not our capital, it\u2019s investor capital, and we try to be very, very good stewards of shareholders\u2019 capital. And so we\u2019ve got a pretty high bar for what we do with that capital, and we don\u2019t think we can generate it back in the business and create a return, we\u2019re going to return it to shareholders.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

So it was good to see the acceleration quarter-over-quarter after its decelerated the past three quarters. I guess, I'm just wondering, Alan, if you could comment on how sustainable you feel like this rate environment is? And if you think the hurricanes over the last few weeks will change the trajectory on the property side, which I know is -- has kind of been a standout a drag on that RRC recently? And then just relatedly, how that impacts your appetite for growth within property, but also in liability lines where it's still an uncertain environment?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYeah. So there's a lot there, David, let me start, and if I don't get to it, I\u2019ll follow-up. But in terms of pricing, I would say that we expect renewal price change continue to be positive and strong for all the reasons I shared in response to Greg's question, now whether that means it goes up a little bit from here or down a little bit from here, I don't really know. But I think the message we would give you for all those reasons is positive and strong. You mentioned you\u2019re -- the comment about property and that price weighing. I guess I would say, you got to take that property pricing together in connection with the return to the property line. So it's not like the returns are struggling and the price is falling. The price change in property is a reflection of the returns on that line. So it's totally rational and totally appropriate. We're not going to share our property pricing strategy, and we'll all just have to wait and see where the market goes on that. But clearly, these storms are a reminder of the potential volatility and the things that we've all got to be thoughtful about in committing capital to risk. Did I get that, David, anything I missed?\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nAnd then just on the -- it sounds like the liability lines in auto and umbrella the rates. It sounded like they accelerated a bit sequentially in the quarter. I'm just wondering, I guess, you guys have made the reserve changes last quarter. It didn't sound like there was any noise this quarter from -- post that. But just your comfort level in terms of leaning into growth in some of those lines?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes. So I think we shared last quarter that even after the charge we took an umbrella, we were comfortable with the returns in umbrella even the last quarter and we remain comfortable with the returns. And again, we're going to execute on a very granular account by account basis. But given where the returns are, given \u2013 we\u2019ve shared before and we talked a lot about this last quarter, there\u2019s a real advantage to reacting quickly to loss cost trends and getting your view of pricing in order. And that gives us real confidence with the way we\u2019re executing in the marketplace today. So we do think in terms of both growth and profitability, there is a huge advantage to reacting quickly to loss trend.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

For my follow-up, so I guess my follow-up be on personal lines. You have said in your prepared remarks that you are, I think, making some changes to deductibles, I believe. I guess, from a -- some of the super regionals are talking about kind of trying to overhaul their roughing with us -- basically the deductibles in a major way, increasing deductibles and maybe rough depreciation schedules or just a higher percentage deductible for rough replacement. Are you -- is Travelers taking more of a slower approach to that or are you making any kind of meaningful changes to your terms and conditions and personal lines in certain geographies?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Mike. It's Michael. I would say, yes, we're very active in making meaningful changes to our terms and conditions for property, particularly, in cat exposed geographies. It's really what I was referring to. When I talked about one of the drivers of the shrink and property is. And specifically, to your question about deductibles, we have moved -- in some states, we have deductibles that are dollar denominated, in other states, we have deductibles that are percentage. But we've made significant moves, particularly in cat exposed states in the Midwest. Along those lines, again, among the other things I mentioned, which are restricting eligibility, doing quite a bit of re-underwriting of the portfolio to really try to manage that exposure.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. I guess that would maybe change the way we need to think about modeling this maybe the loss ratio versus the cat ratio, but I guess, I think I'll follow up offline.

As I shared with you in my comments, we're constantly optimizing our book of business in terms of getting the right equation between risk and reward. When you look at the webcast, first of all, 2023, we had some historical high retention number throughout that period. And we are -- similar to the question Mike just asked around deductibles, that's driven based on severe convective storm and a new peril that's been very dynamic and much more of a frequent weather event. And so, like, Michael and his team, our team in small commercial has also been fine-tuning that particular apparel and the coverage associated with that. And that's why we saw a little bit of the tick down in retention. I called that out in my prepared comments for you.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. Thank you.

In our proxy statement, we do give it admittedly for the prior year, so it won't give you the -- our current year view, but you can see the prior year. And one thing we've shared is, we\u2019ve had a couple of years now of pretty heavy cat losses is that we continue to factor those more recent years into our thought process, and we continue to weigh more recent years more heavily. And so that influences the way we think about cat loads going forward. We haven\u2019t yet given an outlook for cats.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

So I'll reiterate what I said, which was -- so ex-asbestos in BI, we were favorable about $151 million that was driven by workers' comp. It wasn't entirely workers' comp.

It's Michael. We are hard at it, right? I tried to give you the pieces impacting auto growth as we sit here today. And again, in states where we don't have some of the other complications. We are seeing new business growth. And again, that's many states across the country. We're working hard at the states where we don't yet have adequate rates and we're making progress. But obviously, we're subject to those rates getting filed and approved before those flip into that category. But again, we're hard at work on that. And then the other element is the cross-line impact of our work to improve property risk reward, that will take some more time. But again, we're making strong progress there. And so again, as I've said the last couple of quarters, our focus in auto is to profitably grow it. Our focus in home is to improve profitability, given our focus on portfolio business, those two things kind of go hand in hand and that's what I mean when I say we're trying to balance growth and profitability across the book, but it's definitely a strong focus of ours.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nAppreciate it.

This is Greg. Yeah. If I look at workers' comp as a portfolio, I think we're going to see a continuation of what we're seeing right now. And that really is driven based on the strong experience on the line, and we certainly, as leaders in that line have demonstrated that. And so when you look at the bureaus and CCI being the largest one, what we're looking at for a forecast in 2025 for loss cost recommendation. It's very similar to what we saw in 2024. Of course, that doesn't apply to every individual account will have [indiscernible] and etc., on the individual account.

I wanted to talk a little bit about, first, the favorable development in the Personal Lines segment. What years were it growing off the favorable development, and does that mean to some extent you may have overreacted on pricing in some states?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Josh. It's Dan. So I'll start with the PYD story. Part of the PYD story, remember, the end of 2023 was really favorable in Personal Insurance and it was also brand new. The fourth quarter was terrifically strong from a profit perspective, it wasn't fully developed. We posted a really good number in the fourth quarter last year, but we were allowing for the uncertainty that where some of those claims are going to come later, were some of the ones that that did come, going to come with more severity. Nine months further on, we're just more confident. But if I look at the spread of accident years in Personal Insurance, favorable prior year reserve development. There is favorability in recent years. But if I look at the last 10 years, there is favorability in each and every one of the last 10 years. And I'll leave the pricing question for Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYeah. And Josh, I would say, in terms of did we overreact on pricing, again, I would reiterate the comment I made in response to a lease, which is, as we look across the book, we're rate adequate. And I'd also point you to the combined ratio for the year-to-date, if you add back prior year development to try to get to an accident year type number, that number is 97.4%. So I don't think that would be an indication that we've overshot.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nThat makes sense. And so we've had two quarters in a row now with about $170 million, $180 million of prior year favorable development in the Personal Lines segment. A lot of times, there's a certain trend and when that trend deviates throws off favorable development. But are these discrete things that you've noticed that make this degree of favorable development probably less likely to be sustainable if the trends continue or could we continue to see hundreds of million dollars of favorable development, if just the trends keep playing out? I hope, I'm asking the question appropriately.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYeah. Josh, it's Dan. I think I get it, and I'm glad you asked it. I mean, I think if there's two words that I would not put in a sense together, it's prior year reserve development and trend or run rate. And I think we tell you this pretty consistently. We look at all the data as it comes in every quarter. We do thorough reviews of every line every quarter. We're just trying to get it right. What you've seen probably in the last couple of years when loss costs were elevated in '22 and '23. We said we want to get it right. But in getting it right, we want to acknowledge the fact that if there's an elevated level of uncertainty we're going to contemplate that in our reserves. And now, if you've seen some of the inflationary pressures come back down to a more normal level, some of those years have matured and aged out, that's sort of what you're seeing. So you may or may not believe it, I literally don't have a view of whether prior year reserve development is going to be higher, lower or sideways in prior -- in PI in the next several quarters, but that's the way we think about it.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

Good morning, everybody. I want to go back to the BI casualty renewal price changes for a second. From another side, when you have gotten more rate today than last quarter, and then I hear your answers, Alan, about uncertainty and geopolitical risk and social and economic, we talked about stuff for years. I guess, when you're getting more rate today than last quarter, with such strong current core margins, does it mean element your concerns on those things that you answered are more today than they were last year or the year before when you started talking about them?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nDoes it mean that we're more concerned about it. No, I -- the answers that you gave.\n\nMichael Phillips - Analyst (Oppenheimer):\nOkay. That's the answer. That's the question. Are you more concerned today than maybe you were last year?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI wouldn't say that we're more concerned today, you can't really think about this sort of static at a point in time. We're thinking about this looking out the windshield of the future and loss trend is certainly positive, and we'd like pricing to keep up with that. But I would not say that we're more concerned today. And I do think one thing you get with Travelers is pretty early detection and reaction to changes in loss activity. And so, I don't know where it's going to go, but we feel pretty good about the actions that we've taken so far this year.\n\nMichael Phillips - Analyst (Oppenheimer):\nOkay. Thanks. A quick one maybe for Jeff, perhaps. Any updates you can share with, I guess, loss trends in the management liability section? Thanks.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President of Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nNot specific to loss trend, no. I called out in the script for you, and again, this is Jeff Klenk, we said that the earned pricing had an unfavorable impact on the underlying combined ratio. I'd point out though that the pricing strategy is a function of rate adequacy. The returns in the business have been excellent. Our renewal pricing reflects deliberate execution and I feel great about the renewal retention percentage at 90%. Thanks for the question."

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski, Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then, we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our prepared remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic wildfires that have devastated communities across Los Angeles. Our hearts go out to everyone affected, those who have lost their homes, their businesses, and most tragically, their loved ones. At times like these, words alone are, of course, not enough. As a company rooted in the communities we serve, we will be there for our customers and neighbors to support them as they recover and rebuild. We've assessed impacted areas through aerial imagery and made live contact with a substantial majority of our customers with claims, enabling us to expedite claim payments. In addition, our expert claim team is on the ground. We're grateful for their efforts. We also have mobile claim offices positioned in the area where customers can file a claim in person or receive an advanced claim payment. And we look forward to working with policymakers in California to make sure the state has a resilient insurance market going forward. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. We're very pleased to report that for the full-year core income is up 64% to more than $5 billion or $21.58 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 17.2%. These results were driven by strong fundamentals, growth and earned premiums, excellent underwriting profitability, and a higher level of net investment income. That combination makes for a powerful earnings engine, and that momentum is at our backs as we enter 2025. Turning to our fourth quarter results, we are very pleased to have generated exceptional top and bottom line results. Core income for the quarter of $2.1 billion was a record. Net earned premiums increased 9% to $10.9 billion and the combined ratio improved 2.6 points to 83.2%. The improvement in the combined ratio was driven by very strong underlying profitability and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The underwriting margins were strong in all three segments. The combined ratio in business insurance improved by more than a point to an excellent 85.2%. The combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was a very strong 82.7%. And the combined ratio in personal insurance improved more than 6 points to an exceptional 80.7%. These terrific segment results led to a reported consolidated combined ratio that improved 2.6 points to 83.2%. Turning to investments after tax net investment income for the full-year was up 21% to $3 billion, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. These results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 13% during the year to $139.04, after making important investments in our business and returning more than $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders. Turning to the top line, through continued terrific marketplace execution across all three segments, we grew net written premiums during the year by 8% to more than $43 billion and in the quarter by 7% to $10.7 billion. The strong value proposition that we offer to our customers and distribution partners along with outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field, contributed to our top-line success. In business insurance, we grew net-written premiums in the quarter by 8% to $5.4 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment remained very strong at 9.6%, including renewal rate change of 6.9%. Retention also remained strong at 85%. The combination of strong pricing and excellent retention reflects our deliberate and granular execution in a generally disciplined marketplace. In Bond & Specialty insurance, we grew net-written premiums by 7% to $1.1 billion, with excellent retention of 88% in our high quality management liability business. In our market leading surety business, we grew net-written premiums by 19%. We are very pleased to have generated terrific production results across our commercial segments where margins continue to be attractive. That includes our ENS offerings, where we grew net-written premiums by 13% in 2024. In Personal Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 7%, $4.3 billion, driven by continued strong renewal premium change, particularly in our homeowners business. As we wrap up the year, I'd like to take a few minutes to reflect on our 2024 results and put them into an overtime context. As we've shared, we are and have been focusing our investments on three strategic innovation priorities. First, extending our advantage and risk expertise; second, providing great experiences for our customers, distribution partners, and employees; and third, optimizing productivity and efficiency. These investments are designed in large part to position us to grow over time at leading returns. The successful execution of that strategy has been an important contributor to our strong results, providing us with the financial resources that enable us to continue investing at scale, which we believe will increasingly be a differentiator in this industry. It's a virtuous cycle. The data on slide 19 of the webcast presentation illustrate the significant acceleration of our performance, since we launched this strategy. We've grown our net written premiums over the past eight years by more than 70% to over $43 billion. At the same time, we've improved our underlying combined ratio by nearly 7 points. High quality growth with strong underwriting profitability is a noteworthy achievement in this indu"

      "raw_bytes": "over $43 billion. At the same time, we've improved our underlying combined ratio by nearly 7 points. High quality growth with strong underwriting profitability is a noteworthy achievement in this industry. In lines of business with returns that meet our objectives, growth over time has generally come from a combination of price increases and growth in customers. In lines where the emphasis has been on improving returns, premium growth has been driven by higher pricing. In addition, our growth has largely been organic, from products in which we have deep expertise to distribution partners with whom we have longstanding relationships, and in geographies where we have a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and other market dynamics. In other words, a relatively low-risk growth strategy. Through our focus on productivity and efficiency, we've also meaningfully improved our operating leverage over this time. We've allocated some of that benefit to investments and strategic priorities. As you can see on slide 21, since 2017, we've more than doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine, but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over an eight-year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend and improved the strategic mix of that spend. In 2017, our strategic investments represented about a third of our tech spend. In 2024, our strategic tech investment approached nearly half of our overall tech spend of more than $1.5 billion. At the same time, our efforts to improve operating leverage also enable us to lower our expense ratio by more than 3 points, or about 10%. The flexibility that operating leverage gives us to allocate the benefit between investment opportunities in the bottom line is a valuable competitive advantage. Turning to underwriting, the tremendous strength and relative predictability of our underlying underwriting income has increasingly contributed to our bottom line. Our underlying underwriting income has more than tripled over the last eight years, reaching $4.5 billion after tax in 2024. This level of underlying underwriting income positions us to deliver strong income and returns, even with the level of outsized natural catastrophes we in the industry experienced in 2024. Our growth in underwriting income also contributes to the increase in our cash flow from operations, which was $9.1 billion in 2024, our highest level ever, and nearly $4 billion more than it was just five years ago. Our strong operating cash flow is important. It gives us the ability to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders, and grow our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio, which we grew to almost $100 billion at year end, positions us to continue generating a higher level of predictable and reliable net investment income. In summary, we're capitalizing on the successful execution and effective strategy. Our strong results in financial position enable us to be there when our customers need us most, as our friends and neighbors in Los Angeles do right now. The significant momentum we have built gives us great confidence in our ability to continue serving our customers and distribution partners, while delivering for our shareholders. In other words, we remain very confident in the outlook for Travelers. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion and core return on equity was 27.7%, bringing the full-year core income to $5 billion and full-year core ROE to 17.2%. We once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter, and we're very pleased with both the total combined ratio of 83.2% and the underlying combined ratio of 84%. The value of premium growth at strong underlying margins is evidenced by the quarter's underlying underwriting income of $1.4 billion after tax, bringing the year-to-date figure to $4.5 billion. That's our first time ever above $4 billion and an increase of nearly 40% from last year's then record level. The reported and underlying combined ratios for both the quarter and the full-year were very strong in all three segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter came in at 28.2%, once again reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. The full-year expense ratio of 28.5% was in line with our expectations and our guidance throughout the year, even as the excellent loss ratio resulted in higher supplemental commission expense. Looking ahead to 2025, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio at this level for now as the strength of the underlying loss ratio provides continued opportunity to make meaningful investments in both people and technology that we believe will broaden and deepen our competitive advantages well into the future. Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter were a modest $175 million pre-tax, including a net increase of a little more than $100 million related to re-estimation of prior quarter cats. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $262 million pre-tax with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $147 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in abuse and molestation exposure in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $45 million was driven by better-than-expected results in fidelity and surety. Personal Insurance had $70 million of net favorable PYD with favorability in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income of $785 million was, up 22% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets, which as Alan mentioned, is approaching the $100 billion mark. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2025, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $3 billion after-tax, beginning with $710 million in the first quarter and growing to $790 million in the fourth quarter. Page 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long-standing cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events, and we have increased the amount of total coverage for 2025. The per occurrence loss deductible was unchanged at $100 million and we've placed coverage for $3.7 billion of the $4 billion layer above the $4 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have added $150 million of coverage, while reducing the total amount of ceded premium for this treaty. Also as part of our January 1st renewals, we enhanced our casualty reinsurance program for 2025. Thanks to the reinsurance market's receptivity to our casualty book, we were able to purchase more coverage at a lower attachment point on a roughly margin-neutral basis. I point this out to make you aware that the incremental ceded premium related to the additional coverage will impact the growth rate of consolidated net written premium for full-year 2025 by a little less than half a point. Because the written ceded premium impact all hits business insurance in the first quarter, the impact on net written premium growth in Q1 for the BI segment will be about 4 points or about 2 points on a consolidated basis. And while we're talking about the 2025 year, on a financial modeling note, as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, our pre-tax catastrophe plan for 2025 is 6.9 combined ratio points.

Slide 23 also provides a summary of the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. We've provided this view of historical data in our year-end packages for a few years now, but we thought it might also be helpful to share our planned view for the coming year by quarter, so you'll find that here as well. Obviously, the 2025 plan figures were put together without knowledge of the January wildfires in California. As you know, the California wildfires that began earlier this month are going to be a material event for the industry and will have a material impact on our first quarter earnings. Because the event is so recent and to some degree still ongoing, we'd like to take more time to refine our analysis before providing an estimate. Also of interest for 2025, we continue to value our relationship with Fidelis and are pleased to have renewed the 20% quota share with them. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had in place for both 2023 and 2024. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. For the full-year, we generated our best-ever level of operating cash flow at $9.1 billion. Interest rates increased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $2.1 billion after-tax at September 30, $3.6 billion after-tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $139.04 at year-end, up 13% from a year ago. We returned $494 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $252 million and dividends of $242 million. We have approximately $5 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Recapping our results for 2024, core income was just over $5 billion and core ROE was 17.2%. We delivered our highest-ever levels of written premium, underwriting income, net investment income, core income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. In short, we're extremely well-positioned for 2025 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding out a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Segment income for the quarter was nearly $1.2 billion, our highest quarter ever and up about 25% from the prior year quarter, which was our previous quarterly high. The improvement from the prior year was broad-based, driven by higher net investment income, higher underlying underwriting income and higher favorable prior year reserve development. The all-in combined ratio of 85.2% was a great result and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.2%, an all-time quarterly best. The underlying loss ratio improved by more than half a point from the prior year driven by the benefit of earned pricing. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 8% to an all-time fourth quarter high of more than $5.4 billion. Pricing remained strong with renewal premium change of 9.6%, driven by renewal rate change of 6.9%. Retention remained excellent at 85% and new business of $641 million was the second highest fourth quarter result ever, second only to last year's record fourth quarter. We're pleased with these production results and our ability to sustain strong levels of pricing, reflecting the relative return profiles and environmental trends for each line. Renewal rate increases in umbrella and auto were both well into double-digits and both up sequentially from the third quarter. Rate increases in CMP and GL remained strong and generally in line with third quarter levels, while the rate increases in property were less than Q3. More specifically on property rate, the moderation continues to be driven by our national property book, where returns are very strong after several years of compounding rate and improvements in terms and conditions. Across the book, even with these sustained strong pricing levels, retention remained excellent, as I mentioned earlier, reflecting our strong value proposition and the marketplace's acknowledgment of environmental trends and uncertainty. As for the Individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 12%, up about a point from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal rate change of 5.6% ticked up from the third quarter and was up more than 1.5 points from the prior year quarter. As we expected, retention moderated as we continued to intentionally optimize our CMP risk/return profile in a couple of targeted geographies. New business was healthy and near historical highs. Overall, we remain pleased with the granular pricing and underwriting execution driving profitable growth in Select. The mix we are achieving through these actions positions us for long-term success. In middle market, renewal premium change was close to 10% with renewal rate change of 7.8% about flat with the third quarter and up about a point from the prior year quarter. The rate increases remain broad-based as we achieved positive rate change on almost 80% of our middle market accounts. And the execution was once again excellent with meaningful spread from our best-performing accounts to our lower-performing accounts. Lastly, new business of $357 million was our highest-ever fourth quarter and we're pleased with the risk selection and strength of pricing on the accounts we added to the portfolio. As we close out 2024, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income of more than $3.3 billion, the underlying combined ratio of 88.1% and top-line of more than $22 billion were all record results. As for production, renewal premium change and retention, both remained historically high, while new business premiums reached an all-time best. These results are a direct reflection of our strong value proposition as well as the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these exceptional financial and production results, I'm also extremely pleased with our field's execution and our broader team's dedication to delivering new tools, insights and product enhancements. We've strengthened our competitive advantages in several key areas. Among other achievements, we have developed more granular and predictive price-to-risk models, enhanced submission insights based on quality and appetite, leveraged more segmented and responsive loss analytics methodologies and integrated a customer relationship platform with our cutting-edge underwriting workstation. Our financial and operational performance this year was terrific and our continued focus and investment in strategic capabilities positions us extremely well for long-term profitable growth. We're proud of these results and the best-in-class team that produce them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Klenk - President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended the year with another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $228 million, an excellent combined ratio of 82.7% and a strong 86.8% underlying combined ratio in the quarter. Turning to the top line, we're pleased that"

Turning to the top line, we're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we delivered very strong retention of 88%. We're pleased that Corvus transition from an MGA to writing on our high-quality paper drove higher retention relative to Corvus' historical experience. Management liability renewal premium change was positive and improved a point from the third quarter and new business was consistent with the very strong fourth quarter of 2023. Turning to our market-leading surety business. We grew net written premiums by an outstanding 19% from prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our surety products and services and outstanding execution by our team and growing our high credit quality portfolio. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter in Bond & Specialty Insurance, capping off a year during which we delivered record levels of net written premiums in both our surety and management liability businesses. We're also pleased to have delivered excellent returns while making significant strategic investments in our business, including enhancing our cyber capabilities, upgrading our management liability technology platform and optimizing segmentation and productivity through advanced analytics and AI. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share that Personal Insurance delivered segment income of $798 million and a combined ratio of 80.7% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Both results outpaced last year's strong fourth quarter results. For the full-year, PI delivered record segment income of $1.25 billion and a combined ratio of 94.4%, reflecting substantial improvement in the fundamentals of our business. Net written premiums grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the year, bringing full-year net written premium to a record of nearly $17.2 billion. In Automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 94.2%. The underlying combined ratio of 96.3% improved 6.4 points, compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing, lower losses resulting from favorable frequency across a number of coverages and sustained moderation in physical damage severity trends. This quarter's underlying results included a 1.5 point benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year. For the full-year 2024, the auto combined ratio of 95% was a considerable improvement, compared to the prior year, reflecting the success of our disciplined approach to execution. With another quarter of sustained profitability, we remain focused on growing the auto book. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 67.8% improved 3 points, compared to the prior year as an improved underlying combined ratio was partially offset by the impact from higher catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio improved 4.3 points, primarily driven by favorable non-weather losses relative to the prior year and the continued benefit of earned pricing. This quarter's underlying results included a 2 point benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year. Stepping back, the 2024 full-year property combined ratio of 93.9% was a strong calendar year result. That said, we have more work to do to improve accident year profitability and consistently deliver target returns over time. Our production results reflect our continued focus on generating growth in auto, while improving profitability in property through the execution of a granular state-by-state strategy. In domestic automobile, retention remained consistent, while renewal premium change of 10.2% continued to moderate as intended, reflective of auto profitability. We're pleased to note that auto new business premium increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in new policies and new business premiums in states that are not constrained by our property actions. In Domestic Homeowners and Other, retention rose slightly to 86% and renewal premium change of 14.1% remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. In 2025, we expect renewal premium change to increase to the high-teens, as we continue to seek rate increases and further increase insured values to ensure they remain aligned with replacement costs. The slight decline in homeowners policies in force continues to reflect our deliberate efforts to improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy our property capacity. To recap, in 2024, we delivered record net written premiums and segment income. The substantial year-over-year improvement reflects the success of the significant actions we've taken to improve the fundamentals of the business, as well as the moderation of underlying loss trends. At the same time, we continue to invest in and deliver capabilities that will support the profitable growth of our business. Examples include the re-platforming of our specialty products, continued advancement of our IntelliDrive telematics offering, further evolution of our AI-enabled aerial imagery capabilities and modernization of our infrastructure. I couldn't be more proud of our team or more grateful to our distribution partners for their hard work and dedication in the face of an environment that continues to test and challenge us and our industry. In particular, I'd like to recognize our claim team, who as we speak are on the ground in California, supporting our customers in their time of need. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks, Michael. We are ready to open up for questions now."

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Robert Cox at Goldman Sachs.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just first on pricing. I was hoping you could kind of unpack the renewal rate change a little bit and what you saw over the quarter, that might have been indicative of a trend into 2025, whether it's by account size or product. Just curious what changed in the context of an overall stable figure for business insurance?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nHey, Robert, this is Greg. Given the headline numbers, you can see there isn't meaningful change between the pricing. And so, you know, again, our very granular local execution, we continue to look at them account-by-account basis, and we haven't seen any meaningful shift, other than the color that I gave you in the prepared comments. So very stable.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay, got it. Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow-up on cats, you know, obviously a number of large events here. I was hoping you could just walk us through what you booked for Milton, if that $100 million increase in current year cats was all related to Helene and then, you know, not necessarily a quantitative question, but ultimately like the impacts that you expect might come out of the California fires?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Rob, it's Dan. So I'll start with the PYD. So, you know, no big events in the quarter, as you can see, by no new events. You'll be able to see when the cake comes out in the table. Milton was around $60 million for us, a little less than the preliminary range we had provided on the third quarter earnings call. A number of prior quarter cats had adjustments to them, that's typical. That change that you referenced from my prepared remarks was driven by Helene. Not surprising, not concerning. That was a big event in the last five days of the quarter and with sort of an unusual pattern as it, you know, had sort of did more damage in Georgia and the Carolinas than it did in Florida. So when you get a big event at the end of the quarter, you're trying to say, I have other similar historical events that I can model out how claims are going to come in and then what the severity of different types of claims is going to be. We just didn't have a lot of comparables in terms of Helene, so it's not really surprising to see a move there. In terms of California, look as we said in our remarks, it's going to be a big event for the industry. We think it will have an impact on our first quarter earnings for sure, but to the degree that it's still very early and it's still really ongoing, in some cases it's just too soon for us to provide a number at this point."

I guess for the first question, kind of, building on the last answer, in your prepared remarks, Greg, you talked about the select retention dropping down a little bit, doing part to some changes in your CMP profile. If you could give us a little color on that? And maybe as we look at business insurance, give us some perspective on the retention ratios as it relates to lost business that you're losing on price versus intentional re-underwriting?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nOh yes, Greg, let me take those two pieces first. The Select one, start there. You get into a little bit of competitive, sensitive information if I give you the exact specifics of what geographies and industry classes that were non-renewing. But let me give you a little color over the top. We would only do non-renewals when we can't get the right price to risk through the regulatory process. So you can think about severe convective storm. That's a recent peril that continues to be more severe. We've isolated a couple spots where we've needed to non-renewal components of the small commercial book, but that gives you a little bit of the flavor of what's driving that. We think we bottomed out on those non-renewals of Select. So at that 80% retention, that's kind of the expectation that we have given that we are through the thrust of those renewals. In the back half of 2025, we would see some improvement there. So that's really the driver of what's driving the slight deterioration in retention across business insurance.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGreat. And then I guess as a follow-up, and I've asked this question of you before, Alan, but looking at slide 21, which is your technology investments, not really, can you provide us this chart, don't really put some numbers in there, and we hear you in various comments dribble out commentary about where you're making investments in technology, but I thought maybe we could spend a minute and give us some more granular details on what's going on there, because it seems like it's a pretty important initiative for the company.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes, thanks Greg, and good morning. In terms of numbers, we don't put numbers on that scale, but we have shared that the overall tech spend is over $1.5 billion last year, and I think we shared that in the prior year. And if I had to give you a broad brush response to where is it, I would say broadly speaking, but not exclusively, but broadly speaking, we're digitizing the value chain. And so that's digitizing the customer journey. It's modernizing the foundation. It's advanced analytics. It's automation. It's faster speed to market, getting the right price on the risk, those sorts of things. But at the enterprise level, we're also investing in talent and AI and third-party data, product development. The business units and segments are busy at work investing in new products, partner integration, better funding for customers, things like that."

Any -- I heard the prepared remarks, the high level prepared remarks, but anything you'd want to call out as kind of a notable true up, or I guess this level of releases would kind of imply that the IBNR you guys have added in recent years more so than your peers, you know, kind of is helping?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nSure Mike, it's Dan. So, you know, just to come back to the remarks specific to business insurance, you know, the main driver of the favorability was workers comp. Workers comp has been, as you all well know, a very favorable story for a long time now. It's sort of just a question of how much is it from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the way data developments and changes in frequency and severity. We've said it before and I'll just say it again. You know, we don't really think of PYD as a run rate of any sort, so I expect that number to be different from quarter-to-quarter. That was the big piece of good news in the quarter. The only noteworthy piece of unfavorable development in the quarter, as I mentioned on the call, was strengthening in the runoff book for abuse and molestation. There are always other puts and takes in the quarter, but nothing of any significance or worth calling out.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, great. And I guess my follow-up will stick to workers' comp. You may have answered this in Rob's question, but in the prepared marks, I don't think you mentioned kind of any pricing changes quarter-over-quarter or trends on workers' comp? So is it just fair to assume, given the workers' comp pricing is still a bit negative on real pricing?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI would say, Mike, I would describe it as largely stable. The pure renewal rate change is a little bit negative, and with exposure, you get to something a little bit positive. And there's always some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but I think stable is the way I'd describe it."

I'll take that, so I guess the answer is not really. You know, when we have something that we think you need to sort of call out as non-recurring, we try to do it in prepared remarks. You heard Michael referenced, you know, current year prior quarter adjustments benefiting the fourth quarter in auto and home. We didn't call anything out in BI, because we didn't really think there was anything unusual to call out. So the benefit in the quarter is earned price, you know, really terrific underlying at 57.4%. And even within that, we did choose to add a little bit of IBNR to the casualty line, again, reflecting uncertainty in that line. Not a big move. So a pretty clean jump-off point and really driven by benefit of earned pricing.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Thank you. And then maybe just on that point, just adding more IBNR to some of those casualty lines and then maybe just looping in the decision to increase the reinsurance protection on the casualty book? Could you just walk through sort of the thought process of getting the reinsurance and is it just sort of, I mean, you guys are, it seems like you guys are reacting sooner than many in the industry? And is that just sort of added protection as you lean into growth? Or I'd be interested in sort of the thought process there?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nDavid, let me start and then I'll turn it over to Dan, if I leave anything out. I would say the changes we made, we made because we could. And every renewal of every reinsurance treaty, we take a look at our business, we take a look at the reinsurance marketplace and make the best, you know, risk-reward decisions we could make. And so what we were able to achieve for the price we were able to achieve it, we thought made a lot of sense. But I would describe, you know, ordinary course process and a terrific result."

The tort environment is -- it\u2019s definitely continues to be front and center in front of mind for us. It's an environmental issue that we're all facing. Yes, from a public policy perspective, the insurance industry might be the tip of the spear, but this is really an industry for businesses and consumers. And I think there's a growing recognition of that. It also has contributed to some very difficult insurance markets in a few states, and we've seen a couple of states take action to respond to that. And in a couple of other states, we've had some favorable development in terms of some legislation around third-party litigation financing disclosure, which we think is positive and hope is a trend. So continues to be front and center for us, and we continue to try to get at it."

My first was on catastrophes in the 2025 plan. I think you mentioned there's nothing in there related to California wildfires, but your full year assumption at 6.9 points, I think that's a little bit maybe below the last couple of years. So could you maybe just help us with what's going into that planning assumption?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nSure. Well, there's a lot of methodology and thought and frankly, judgment that goes into that number. And I think it would be premature to assume that what we've seen in the last couple of years that, that high watermark is a new normal going forward. But certainly, we take a look at that and incorporate into our thinking and we've waived the more recent years more heavily as we've come up with the cat plan. So I think that 6.9 points on a point basis would cover the cat losses in seven out of the last 10 years or something like that. So we've got a bias toward the high end of recent experience. But again, we think it would be a little premature to assume that this high watermark is any normal.\n\nWes Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And my follow-up on reserve development in BI, I know you talked about favorability in workers' comp. Are you able to size the gross amount of favorable development for us in the fourth quarter?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Wes, it's Dan. So we were -- you could think about that as comp in the fourth quarter being in the ballpark of around $250 million of good news.\n\nWes Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

I'm wondering if it changes your approach to the market and just how competitive you want to be on place and desire to grow, et cetera?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Alex. It's Michael. I would say, not really. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at the full-year result at about a 94 and you take out PYD, you get to a 98 that is not delivering target returns in the property line of business. We also, throughout the year, have commented on favorable frequency in property, offset by a bit of percent severity. Hard to know how much of that favorable frequency is going to persist. And so that's really why I said we still have work to do in property and our focus on property really remains on improving profitability and generating consistent target returns.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. As a follow-up, I wanted to see if I could ask one on the ongoing wildfires in California. Any additional color you can help us with regarding your exposure maybe to Pacific Palisades in particular, the way you approach the more wildfire prone areas of that market, anything on additional living expenses that might just help us well, I know you're not willing to quantify at this point, that totally makes sense. Like anything that could kind of help us understand.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nAlex, I just don't think there's a lot we can share there. We have, and I think Michael shared this recently we've taken steps to thoughtfully manage our exposure in wildfire prone areas, others have too. So we don't know what that's done to our relative market share in some of these places. So I don't know if there's any real color that we can give beyond what we've already shared."

My first question, I just want to go back to the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio. So you guys saw in the third quarter, right? There was 180 basis points of year-over-year improvement? And you said, right, that there was no real noise to call out. So that was kind of a good run rate? Now it seems like 60 basis points this quarter is a run rate. I know you guys said that you -- there was some conservatism put into the casualty picks, but I believe that was the case in every quarter this year. So what was the change from the 180 to the 60 that now seems like run rate in BI from Q3 to Q4 on the underlying loss ratio?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nElyse, it's Dan. So when we're talking about adjustments to jump off point of run rate, again, we really think it's important to look at the business comparing the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter, the third quarter to the third quarter, not either the sequential quarter or the sequential margin improvement. So we're trying to give you a jump-off points of was there anything particularly unusual in a quarter that you think about that as your model beginning point for the next year's quarter that you'd call out. It's not to say that there's zero besides pricing. There are -- as we've said in each of the quarters this year, there's a number of puts and takes each year, but none of them were individually that significant and so we're down to a point of we're inside of a point of change, and we're trying to say, is there anything in there that really seems like it's abnormal and should be adjusted or are we thinking about it as not a \u201cclean jump-off point\u201d, and that's the color we're trying to give you there, not to the basis point of how much is the improvement going to be in one quarter versus the next.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the California fires for a second. We obviously can look at statewide share -- market share. Is there any commentary, I guess, you would give relative to statewide share for travelers relative to potential share in the impacted areas? And my second question, Dan, on the reinsurance coverage, right, that's an aggregate cover, right? So I know there's like a $4 billion retention and then there's deductibles. But if the fire is a large event, this does earmark your cats to a certain degree, right, for the full-year. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nLet me start on your market share question, and then I'll turn it over to Dan for the reinsurance question. So you could take some estimate of market share and apply it to an estimate of industry loss, and that would give you what I would describe as a point of reference. So pretty blunt instrument, though, for reasons. First, it's obviously pretty sensitive to whatever estimate you have of insured losses for the industry, and that's going to develop over time. And second, when it comes to market share, the publicly available market share is dated information. It doesn't reflect actions we or others have taken to manage exposure and it doesn't reflect any differences that might exist between local market share and statewide market share. So those are the cautions I'd give you in applying that. But it's a reference point, I get it.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nAnd then, Elyse, with regard to the 2025 cat treaty, you're right, one of the, we think, great features of our treaty is that it is an aggregate cover. So while I wouldn't expect recoveries under the treaty from the California wildfires to the degree that they impact first quarter earnings, and it's a big number. There's $100 million per event deductible as I said in my prepared remarks and as you can see on the chart. But yes, this will accumulate towards the $4 billion retention, which if there's a very active second quarter for cats, or a very active third quarter for cats, it's possible that we'd be talking about recoveries under the treaty."

Can you maybe talk about how, if at all, they would impact the company's appetite for Home and Property business in the state. Would you look to further prune exposure to wildfires? Or do you believe that the actions that you've taken to-date positioning well from that perspective?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nI'll start and then Michael, I'll turn it over to you. I think it's going to depend on how the market reacts to it. The insurance market was challenged going into this. There were some recently adopted reforms, and I think that was a good start. It's possible that this is going to be a catalyst for further and meaningful reforms. So I think we're just going to wait and need to see how that shakes out before we make any decisions.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes. And the only thing I would add to that, Yaron, is we've been shrinking in California coming into the event. We have a rate increase for property on file with the department as we speak, which clearly doesn't include the losses from the California wildfires. So all of that will certainly feed into our assessment of actions we need to take going forward.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nMakes sense. And then, Michael, maybe another question for you. It sounds like your appetite for Auto is -- Personal Auto is growing, you're open for business in a growing number of states. At the same time, I'm sure you're seeing the same headlines we are on tariffs and the like. Are you -- is your appetite for Auto taking into account the potential for tariffs? Or is that something that you'll react to if and when we actually see those put in place?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. It's a great question, and I would lean more towards the latter in terms of your question. I think certainly, it's hypothetical, it's hard to predict. We don't know which countries we don't know what amounts and where auto parts and autos come from. It depends a lot on which countries you're talking about. And what level those tariffs are at. And so as opposed to trying to predict it, we're looking at our prospective viewer rate adequacy. We feel great about the margins in the business. Today, we're actively pursuing Auto growth and will continue to do so. And then we'll reflect any changes in our pricing when and if we know what they are and then factor that into the calculus at that point in time."

Can you tell us the degree to which some Travelers' policies might exclude fire or is the Travelers' policy, one that has not been put anyone to the fair plan and has comprehensive coverage?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Josh. It's Michael. So we write two types of property policies in California. We write a standard Quantum Home 2.0 property policy that does include coverage for a wildfire in areas where we do not have an appetite to write policies that cover fire. We do write what we call a DIC policy, which you can think of as a policy that excludes losses from fire and wildfires. Some customers pair that with a fair plan policy, because then they have the Travelers, claim service, they have the Travelers coverage for non-fire losses. And so we do have both types of policies in force in the state.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd just one other question, and I'm not trying to hold number on you, just trying to be smart. What is Travelers appetite for $5 million on in the state of California or whatnot? I don't think Travelers is targeting high net worth individuals, but California is an expensive real estate market. Can you just talk about appetite and what are the normal Travelers target home in that state?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, sure, Josh. It's Michael again, I would say our appetite for and our exposure to $5 million homes in California is very limited. As you know and we've talked about in the past, our appetite really is middle market and mass affluent business. I would say when you get to $5 million homes, we would consider that really more high net worth business, and we're not a significant player in that market.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

And then you talked a bit about Personal Auto. I guess we're kind of hearing a bit of a mixed bag between different companies on where they are with rates and how much they want to grow.

I would say the competitive environment last quarter versus this quarter is fairly consistent. And I would say our observations on what's happening in the marketplace are fairly consistent. I think the good news is that we continue to make progress. As we pursue auto growth, new business was up 6% relative to the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's fourth quarter new business is actually a record for fourth quarter new business for us in Auto. And as I mentioned, in states that aren't constrained by our property actions, we're growing both new policies and new business premium in aggregate. So we're encouraged by the progress and I would say the marketplace has remained relatively consistent over the last couple of quarters."

Miss Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to The Travelers Companies, Inc.'s Discussion of our first quarter 2025 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO, Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer, and our three segment presidents, specialty insurance, and Michael Klein of personal insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-Ks filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation is included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report a substantial profit for the quarter despite the devastating January California wildfires. We delivered core income of $443 million or $1.91 per diluted share, as outstanding underlying results, strong net favorable prior year reserve development, and higher investment income more than offset catastrophe losses. Over the last four quarters, thanks to strong underlying fundamentals, we generated a core return on equity of 14.5%. That demonstrates our ability to deliver healthy returns over time, notwithstanding elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses. Underlying underwriting income of $1.6 billion pretax was up more than 30% over the prior year quarter. That was driven by strong net earned premiums of $10.7 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio that improved 2.9 points to an excellent 84.8%. All three segments contributed to these underlying results with strong and higher net earned premiums and excellent underlying profitability. The underlying combined ratio in business insurance improved to an excellent 88.2%. The underlying combined ratio in our bond and specialty business was a very strong 87.3%, and the underlying combined ratio in personal insurance improved by within six points to a terrific 79.9%. Consistent with the announcement we made in February, catastrophe losses from the California wildfires were $1.7 billion pretax. I'm grateful to our claim team for their continued excellent work taking care of our customers and supporting the community's recovery. We've already paid out nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, including substantial advance payments to our customers who suffered total losses. Even after that, operating cash flows for the quarter were a very strong $1.4 billion. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well. After-tax net investment income of $763 million for the quarter was driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and positive returns from our thoughtfully managed alternative investment portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return nearly $600 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $358 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to make important investments in our business, as we completed another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share increased by 11% compared to a year ago. In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $1.10 per share, marking 21 consecutive years of dividend increases to the compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. Turning to production, excellent execution by our field organizations drove top-line growth with all three of our segments contributing. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums to $10.5 billion. In business insurance, we grew net written premiums by 2% to a record $5.7 billion after the ceded premium impact of the enhanced casualty reinsurance program that we announced last quarter. As we previewed with you, that reduced the segment's net written premium growth in the quarter by four percentage points. As a full year's worth of ceded premium was booked in the first quarter. Renewable premium change in the segment was double digits or high single digits in every line other than workers' comp. Even with strong pricing pretty much across the board, retention improved nearly two points from the fourth quarter to 86% and was higher in every line. That dynamic of strong pricing and retention speaks to continued discipline in the marketplace. New business for this segment was a record $735 million, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In bond specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums by 6% to $1 billion, with excellent retention of 89% in our high-quality management liability business. In our industry-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by 13%. In the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In personal insurance, net written premiums grew 5% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong renewal premium change, particularly in our homeowners business. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to comment on how The Travelers Companies, Inc. is positioned in what feels like an uncertain macroeconomic road ahead. In short, we are entering 2025 in a position of strength. We are a market leader in a diversified portfolio of businesses, each with a strong value proposition to offer to our customers and distribution partners. Our underlying margins are in great shape. In each segment, we have attractive loss ratios and expense ratios that reflect the year's strategic focus on optimizing operating leverage. Our cash flow is strong and resilient. Our investment portfolio is thoughtfully managed to deliver highly reliable returns, including through periods of market stress. We have a fortress balance sheet with a strong capital base and almost no debt coming due in the next eight years. On top of all that, we have the resources and financial strength to continue making strategic investments i"

All of which is to say, just as we have successfully served our customers and distribution partners and created shareholder value over time, including through periods of economic disruption, we are very well positioned to continue doing so now. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you, Alan. Travelers delivered $443 million of core income in the first quarter, despite significant losses from the California wildfires. The higher level of cat losses was partially offset by a significant increase in underlying underwriting income, a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, and higher net investment income. As you heard from Alan, trailing twelve-month core return on equity was 14.5%. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $1.6 billion was up 32% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio that improved by 2.9 points to 84.8%. The underlying combined ratio was our second-best result ever and once again featured very strong results in all three business segments. We were pleased with the first quarter expense ratio of 28.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year, we remain comfortable with an expense ratio expectation of 28% to 28.5%. Our continued focus on operating leverage enables us to maintain this level of expense ratio even as we increase the amount of strategic technology spend to further strengthen our competitive advantages, positioning us for continued success well into the future. We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $378 million pretax in the first quarter, with all three segments contributing. In business insurance, net favorable development of $74 million pretax was driven by workers' comp. In bond and specialty, net favorable PYD of $67 million pretax was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal insurance recorded net favorable PYD of $137 million pretax, with significant improvements in both auto and home. Catastrophe losses for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion pretax, driven by the California wildfires in January, for which our estimate of $1.7 billion is unchanged from the estimate we preannounced in February. After-tax net investment income increased 9% from the prior year quarter to $763 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations, benefiting from both higher yields and a higher level of invested assets. Our outlook for fixed income NII by quarter, including earnings from short-term securities, is $725 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $755 million in the third quarter, and then to around $790 million in the fourth quarter. NII from our alternative investment portfolio was also positive in the quarter. Given recent movement in the equity markets, it's a good time to remind you that results for our private equities, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one-quarter lag. And while not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns tend to directly follow the broader equity markets. In other words, the impact of the decline in financial markets that occurred in the first quarter will be reflected in our second quarter results. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were again very strong, despite the elevated payout related to the California wildfires. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates decreased during the quarter, net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3.6 billion after tax at year-end to $3.3 billion after tax at March 31st. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $138.99 at quarter-end, basically unchanged from year-end and up 11% from a year ago. Share repurchases this quarter included $250 million of open market repurchases. We had an additional $108 million of buybacks in connection with employee share-based compensation plans. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining under prior board authorizations for share repurchases. Dividends were $241 million in the quarter, and as Alan mentioned earlier, our board authorized a five-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share. In summary, our first quarter results once again demonstrate the significant earnings power that results from our ability to leverage our ability to grow premiums across our well-diversified book of business while maintaining very attractive margins. Along with steadily increasing net investment income from our growing investment portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Dan. Business insurance had a strong start to 2025. The segment income for the first quarter of $683 million, underlying underwriting income, net prior year reserve development, and net investment income all improved from the first quarter of 2024. The underlying combined ratio of 88.2% was an excellent result and a point better than the prior year quarter, driven by the benefit of earned pricing. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 2% to a record quarterly high of $5.7 billion, inclusive of the four-point ceded premium impact Alan referenced. As we indicated in our comments previously, we expect the change in our reinsurance program to be neutral in terms of underwriting income. Pricing remains strong with renewal premium of 9.2%, driven by renewal rate change of 6.4%. Retention increased to an excellent 86%, and new business of $735 million was an all-time quarterly high. We're pleased with these production results and our ability to sustain strong levels of pricing and retention. That combination is a reflection of market-wide discipline in response to ongoing environmental trends and uncertainty. Renewal rate change remained high, coming in at well over 6% for the eighth quarter in a row. The small tick down from Q4 was driven by our national property book, where returns are very strong after several years of compounding rate and improvements in terms and conditions. In our select and core middle market businesses, renewal rate change remains strong and in line with fourth quarter levels. From a line perspective, renewal rate change was highest in umbrella and auto, while CMP reached an all-time high and GL remained strong. The execution by our field organization was exceptional, achieving the highest retention levels in our best-performing business and the highest levels in our other accounts. The granular execution contributes to optimizing the portfolio's returns. This success is possible based on the robust data that we have, the advanced analytics, and sophisticated tools we put in the hands of our frontline underwriters, as well as the strength of the talent that we have in the field. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remains strong at 11.6%, up 1.5% from the first quarter of last year, while renewal rate change of 5.8% was up nearly two points from a year ago. As we expected, retention was stable at 80%, driven by our targeted CMP risk-return optimization efforts, which will begin to wind down in the third quarter. New business of $159 million was a quarterly record. Overall, we feel terrific about how we're strategically managing the mix of business to drive long-term profitable growth in select.

Our distribution partners have embraced the industry-leading experience and segmentation benefits we're getting from our BOP 2.0 and new commercial auto product. In middle market, renewal premium change was in line with the fourth quarter at close to 10%, with strong renewal rate change of 7.5%. The rate increases remain broad-based as we achieved positive rate change on more than three-quarters of our middle market accounts. Retention of our high-quality book remained historically high at 89% and increased a point from the fourth quarter, while new business of $434 million was an all-time quarterly high. To sum up, business insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our high-quality book while investing in capabilities that position us well for long-term success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President of Bond & Specialty Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Greg. Bond and Specialty started the year with another strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. We generated segment income of $220 million, an excellent combined ratio of 82.5%, and a strong 87.3% underlying combined ratio in the quarter. Turning to the top line, we're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we delivered excellent retention of 89%. Renewal premium change remained positive and generally consistent with the fourth quarter. As expected, new business was lower than the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder, Corvus production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter and now is mostly renewal premium. Comparison to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted. Turning to our market-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by an excellent 13% from the prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our surety products and services, and outstanding execution by our team in growing our high credit quality portfolio. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter while continuing to make significant strategic investments in our business. With some notable achievements, to name just a few, we released our first product on our new management liability technology platform, a modernized accountants professional liability product and rate plan with enhanced digital capabilities, and a significantly streamlined workflow. Capitalizing on the Corvus acquisition, for the benefit of our admitted cyber customers, we launched an improved cyber risk policyholder portal with enhanced value-added services. And we're leveraging our industry-leading data advantage and deploying multiple artificial intelligence models to drive underwriting enhancements, including as just one example automating the process for certain employment practices liability renewals. Looking ahead, we're planning additional capability and product releases during the year that will further extend our competitive advantages. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the first quarter segment loss of $374 million and combined ratio of 115.2% reflect the impact of the California wildfires, a significant event for us and the industry. Strong underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year development partially offset catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 79.9%, a record quarterly result for the segment, continues to reflect the actions we've taken to improve the underlying fundamentals of our business in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 5% in the quarter, driven by higher renewal premium change. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 83.4% and included a six-point benefit from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 87.5% improved 7.4 points compared to the first quarter of the prior year. This improvement was driven by lower losses resulting from both favorable frequency across all coverages and sustained moderation of severity trends, as well as the benefit of higher earned pricing. As a brief reminder, the first quarter is historically our seasonally lowest combined ratio of the year in auto. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 145.5% includes the impact of the California wildfires. The underlying combined ratio of 72.6% improved five points compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven by the continued benefit of earned pricing and lower non-weather losses compared to the prior year. Our production results reflect our efforts to position our portfolio for long-term profitable growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent periods. Renewal premium change continues to moderate as intended, reflecting improved profitability and our focus on returning to profitable growth in auto. We're pleased to note that auto new business premium increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by states that are not constrained by our property actions. In domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change increased to 19.6% as a result of our actions to align insured values with rising replacement costs, while we continued to achieve strong rate increases. The decline in homeowners policies in force continues to be driven by our deliberate efforts to improve profitability and reduce exposures in high cat risk geographies. While those same actions continue to constrain our ability to grow auto PIP in the near term, we believe the trade-off makes sense for the long-term performance of our diversified first lines portfolio. Before I wrap up, I'd like to thank our team and our distribution partners for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. With their partnership and support, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our clients and to build a larger, more profitable business over time. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for Q&A."

We'll go first to David Motemaden at Evercore.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nThanks. Good morning. Alan, you made some comments just on the macro environment at the end of your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could just talk about how you're thinking through the impacts of the tariffs across your businesses, both personal and commercial lines? And more importantly, how you're thinking about responding in the marketplace.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure, David. Good morning. Thanks for the question. You know, just in terms of background, and then high level, I'd say, as far as the direct impacts go, we think it's pretty manageable for us. It's just a fraction of auto and property losses that are physical damage related, and only a fraction of those are for materials that would be impacted by the tariffs. The most significant impact for us is likely to be a one-time impact on physical damage repair costs. For us, that most notably impacts private passenger auto. From there, the impacts diminish pretty significantly. And just to give you a sense of the magnitude, David, assuming the tariffs as they've been announced remain in place and are largely passed through, and I think there's a question about that, we'd expect, you know, somewhere around a mid-single-digit increase to PI auto severity. Again, that's a one-time impact, you know, not a slope impact. Having said that, we would actually expect the actual impact to be somewhat less. So first, we think participants in the value chain will likely seek to mitigate the impact through some combination of advanced inventory buildups, substitution of goods, reorganization of supply chain, lower tariff pass-through rates, things like that. And second, the actual impacts could be mitigated by other factors, for example, extended lives of cars on the road. Also, just looking at our PI auto margins now, the auto place and if the recent favorable loss trends persist, then we'll see whether they do or not. But if recent favorable trends persist, we may be able to absorb whatever the impact is inside our loss. So I would say for now, we're prepared to watch and react to the extent that we need to, and however the loss trends evolve, we've got the tools and the capability to see it pretty quickly, and we'll reflect it in our pricing models.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nUnderstood. Thanks for that. And maybe just switching gears to the growth in the quarter within business and insurance. Sorry to be super short term here, but when I think about the 2%, is it right to think about just adding back that four points of reinsurance drag and sort of that's like a sort of like a run rate level before I think about different moving pieces as we head into the second quarter such as mix, and price?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nDavid, let me start and I'll turn it over to you, Greg. So as for a starting point, you definitely would add back the four to get to a level. There's always other things in the quarter that are gonna impact premium from one period to another. You know, there's product production booking, for example. There's endorsements, cancellations, all those sorts of things. So that would have an impact. I would tell you to look at the strength of the production in the quarter. I mean, you can look at retention price and it's all very strong levels.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):"

I think it was Dan in the comments around the expense ratio, you mentioned increased tech spend. One of your peers had an investor day and spoke at length about what they're doing on the tech side of the business. I went back to your fourth quarter presentation where you gave a slide on your technology investments and the routine and necessary versus the strategic. I'm under the impression that a portion of your tech spend is just maintenance on legacy systems. Can you talk about what you're doing on the tech spend area? In response to this. And is the strategic just all new or is that partly rehab of legacy systems?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Well, first of all, Greg, thank you. Good morning. I love that you're focusing on that slide as we think it tells a great story. I mean, you can see over the period in that slide, you know, we've done a great job of maintaining the routine but necessary expenditures. And, yes, that is, you know, everything from licensing fees to patching systems, all the things you have to do whether you like it or not. Routine and necessary, I think sums it up. And if you look over that period, we have increased the mix of our strategic spend from I think at the beginning of the first year in that period, I think it's something like a third, and I think, you know, last year was approaching a half. And so, I mean, that certainly would be new expenses, but it would also be the carryover expenses of things that we started in prior years that we continue to invest in. So all in all, you know, we are spending considerably more over a billion and a half dollars a year. Our strategic mix is much more favorable now. And we've done all that inside an expense ratio that we've reduced meaningfully over the period. So, you know, we think we're investing in the right things and doing it pretty effectively.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nAlright. Thanks for the color. My follow-up question and I don't get too hung up on our quarterly number, but the PYD for the first quarter seemed a little bit better than expected. And I know you already addressed the tariff component inside your lost cost, but I'm just curious, has there been any change in your perspectives on what your underlying loss cost trends are across your book? And then maybe speak specifically to the development again in the auto business, which clearly was up a little stronger than I expected at least.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nGreg, it's Dan. So I'll start with the PYD auto piece just to give you a little bit of color there. So, you know, better than we had allowed for. And in auto, you're really talking about better than expected frequency and severity in both physical damage coverage and bodily injury. So sort of good across the board. Just to go back to the loss trend question, you know, we've sort of tried to get away from giving a specific trend number, but I think it's fair to say that trend in the quarter at least behaved pretty much as we would have expected it to. And so that's why you hear both Mike and Greg talking about the benefit of earned price and how that shows through in improved margins because the loss trend really was about as expected.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

When we think about the deductible on your cat program, is it fair to just assume whatever the cat losses were in the quarter and the remainder up to $4 billion is kinda what you got less in your deductible or we think about it a different way?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah, Brian. So the one thing to keep in mind is as we said in describing that program at the end of the year, which is not a change from the way it had worked in previous years, the first $100 million of any event is for our account. So you really would look at the items that we put in the 10-Q table of significant cats because that's anything over $100 million. Take $100 million off of those, and that's what goes towards the $4 billion. That's, you know, basically, that's directionally how it works.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nPerfect. Thanks for that clarification. And then my second question, I'm just curious, and this is for Jeff. Surety bond growth, you know, given what we're seeing, you know, potential for economic activity as well as just some of the, you know, reductions in kind of government spending. Think that'll allow to any impact on surety business here going forward, or is this just not a big government component to it?\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President of Bond & Specialty Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nNo. There's definitely a government component to a lot of the large projects, Brian. So that's a fair question. We're watching that closely. We're working with our contractors. There's a lot of planning that they do, long-term planning that they're focused on. So we're definitely hearing that from them. All of that said, we've had some nice strong growth. We expect the infrastructure investments and bond demand to continue. But and as I've mentioned to you before, we have a really high credit quality book of contractors on the surety side. And so we feel good about our position as we move forward.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

We're also looking at today. I'm not sure. Do you mean too early in the morning or too early in the I I I do think it's it's it's too early for for us to see that. And and I also you know, as I as I really think about that question, I think it's too early to really know what it we're all responding to. I mean, there's obviously a a lot of change, you know, back and forth. So I'm I'm not sure people really know what they're responding to yet.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nRight. I was kind of asking whether that level of uncertainty itself produces a result maybe just because of caution, but I completely take your point. On the timing. I think, listen, I guess, for Michael, I two-pronged question. How quickly do you think travelers can respond if there is an inflection in lost costs compared to maybe the most recent interruption? And is there any reason to switch the book more towards six-month policies because we keep on seeing these fluctuations or these inflections in lost trend.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Thanks, Meyer. I think as Alan mentioned, you know, we see the changes in our loss cost relative. As a little bit of a technical point, right, what you're doing as you factor those increased costs into your experience is including them in the historical experience that you had. So one of the things that impacts how quick you can respond is how good your experience was as you factor those things in. But I don't see a challenge with our ability to recognize and factor those costs into our outlook, you know, as quickly as we see them. To the second part of your question in terms of six-month policies, we did make a change in the last year or two in terms of monoline auto policies being predominantly written on a six-month basis at new business. So that is working its way into the portfolio. I wouldn't say it's dramatically changed the makeup of the portfolio between six-month and annual. But directionally, we are moving a little bit towards a higher percentage of six-month policies in the portfolio as a result.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

This is Greg. What you're seeing there if you're looking at the international within the BI segment, there's two primary drivers of that. One is the Fidelis relationship continues to be very strong. That's one of them. And the other one is Lloyds can bounce around and be a little bit lumpy from quarter to quarter, and we had a strong quarter this month. So that's what's driving those items.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nOkay. That's helpful. And then maybe along the same lines, I'm just trying to understand premiums. You know, notice middle market was down a little bit year over year. You know, I had kinda been thinking that that scenario where pricing is staying, you know, pretty attractive relative to loss cost trend. I mean, hard to tell whether that's just the casualty reinsurance impact. In the allocation of middle market. But could you help me think through that and just relative attractiveness of that market?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. I would say and you you nailed that. You know, we feel terrific about the returns we're producing across the portfolio and specifically in middle market and the growth we're getting there. What you just mentioned is the primary driver of the Casualty Ag Treaty that we called out. Think about middle market, it has a much higher amount of umbrella and excess casualty products, much more casualty-based than you would see particularly relative to select. So it's gonna feel disproportionately that impact in that business.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nAlex, I don't mean to stress for a second that we're immune from going on in the economy and economic activity. But I again, I would point you back to the production statistics. The middle market had very strong retention pricing and new business. I would just point you back there for just for a sense of the growth.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nYep. That's all helpful. Thank you."

So it's Dan. So really what we try to do a pretty good job of calling out, you know, the things that moved in and were noteworthy in any way. In this quarter, usually, that means we're talking about more than one or two things. But this quarter, it really did happen to be driven by comp. It's not to say that there weren't other lines that moved. There are always other puts and takes in any given line and in any given quarter, just nothing that moved big enough to call out one way or the other.\n\nWes Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nThat was helpful, Dan. And maybe just back on the macro and capital management, but curious how management's thinking about buybacks from here and perhaps some heightened macro uncertainty and maybe if there's a bit of pressure on the stock just from broader stock market pressure generally. Is that an opportunity to lean into buybacks or might you wanna be more measured in a period of heightened uncertainty?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. So, you know, we really we have the same philosophy of capital management first also. So no change in the way we think about that. Remember, we entered, you know, 2025 in a pretty strong capital position given how strong the finish to the 2024 year was. You know, we talked about buyback activity in the first quarter. I'd say that was probably dialed back a little bit from what we might have otherwise have done given the significance of the California wildfires and the fact that they occurred so early in the quarter. I feel like, you know, we're gonna maintain a very healthy capital position. Our history is we're gonna continue to generate more capital than we need to run the business and can deploy at attractive returns. And so I'd expect us, you know, not in any particular month or any particular quarter, but I'd expect us to be doing buybacks. And we don't really try to sort of lean in or lean out depending on short-term fluctuations in the stock price. We're really just rightsizing capital over time."

Good morning. I would say that for now, we see that as pretty negligible. I mean, you just look at the mix of the cost drivers in the liability lines, and just not a lot of it is subject to tariffs. And I don't mean to suggest that it's a zero impact, but we think the likely outcome is pretty negligible.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the business insurance underlying loss ratio. How the pressure that you guys have kind of been seeing and the industry has been seeing for the last couple of years in casualty is trending there. Maybe more specifically, the other liability occurrence loss ratios, are they still kind of going up year over year? I know you guys added to the conservatism in those picks last year. And, also, is there any, you know, kind of one-time items, like non-cat weather this quarter?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure, Rob.

In terms of the casualty lines and the way we're thinking about those loss picks, yeah, you're right to remember that last year, we talked about, you know, adding a bit more in the IBNR for those lines given the uncertainty in the line. We've carried that into 2025. So I wouldn't put a fine point and quantify it, but you know, we've carried that sort of philosophy into the way we're thinking about making our loss picks this year.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

And, Michael, I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks, but unpack kind of the reacceleration we've seen in pricing. Do you feel this is more a traveler-specific, you know, as you continue to kind of reshape your, you know, geographic footprint or is this more of kind of industry-wide you feel in terms of reacting to what you said was also higher replacement costs and what we can see is persistently higher catastrophe levels? And just also curious as your pricing power does that include changes in deductibles or terms and conditions? Thanks.\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure. Thanks, Michael. So I would say the change from Q4 to Q1 really is about increasing insurance limits to keep up with replacement costs. And we think that's really in response to broad industry trends. Right? Continued increases in labor and materials, particularly things like roofing costs, roofing labor are big drivers of that. We think that's really sort of a broad-based, you know, industry and economic trend that we're responding to. And, again, the delta from the sort of mid to low teens to the high teens from Q4 to Q1 really is driven by that limit change. As I mentioned, we continue to seek and obtain significant rate in property. Underneath that, and those two come together to form that RPC number.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. And my follow-up is kind of switching gears to social inflation. When we look at statutory data on an industry-wide basis, which I, you know, I appreciate it's a bit backward-looking. It appears that social inflation levels are rising. Would you agree with that viewpoint or are you all seeing that maybe the trend line has stabilized and obviously, we appreciate that the travelers have been very proactive in taking more conservative, you know, views on your reserves and etcetera. But just curious on an industry-wide basis if you if Travelers has a view whether kind of social inflation continues to kind of gear a bit higher. Thanks.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nI would say social inflation is unfortunately alive and well and continues to impact the industry and including us. We see that. I would also say we've anticipated that. So the levels of social inflation we're seeing are generally consistent with our expectations. Thank you for the question."

My first question, within personal lines, are there any kind of, you know, I think you called out lower non-weather losses in home. Any kind of one-off items that you would, you know, put numbers on within the underlying combined ratios in auto and home in the quarter?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Elyse. It's Michael. I don't think really beyond what I called out again, just to reiterate. Right? On auto, we said improved frequency across multiple coverages, and then we talked about sustained moderation in severity trends. The one thing I would say in auto, again, just to reiterate, is Q1 is typically our lowest combined ratio quarter in that line. So if you think of that as a one-off, that's just, I think, an important reminder. Other than that, you know, I think we had, you know, another mild winter in 2025. We had a mild winter in 2024. So that's, again, just something to keep in mind as you look forward. The last thing I would point out on auto is renewal premium change has been declining on a written basis. That will drive lower earned impact from lower earned favorable impact from pricing as we look forward, which again, you can just see as you look in the rearview mirror at those RPEs. Numbers, there won't be as much favorable earned effective pricing in the go-forward quarters. As respects property, again, I pointed to favorable non-weather experience. That's something we've been talking about. It's something we continue to see particularly favorable frequency in non-weather water and fire loss experience.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my follow-up, you know, sticking, I guess, with personal auto on the impact of tariffs. I know in response to an earlier question, right, you guys mentioned, you know, one of the offsets, right, as an advanced, you know, buildup in advance of these tariffs. And you guys, I think, said, you know, mid-single-digit impact on trend. So as you think about timing, just given, right, that there is, you know, obviously gonna be a buildup of parts and it takes time for there to be an impact, think you'll start to see the impact of the tariffs and that higher loss trend in May and June, so, like, in Q2? Or how do you think about just, like, quarterly cadence of the impact on your personal auto margin from the tariffs?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Elyse, two things. One, I just wanna be really clear on this. It's not a change in trend. It's a one-time change in the severity. So I think it's just an important clarification. And two, it's hard for us to really know when this would take effect, but that May, June time frame seems a little short. So probably a little later in the year, sometime in the back half of the year, but I'm not sure I'd call it more finely than that."

Just on the auto business, I think you mentioned it was constrained a little bit by some actions. On the property side. Could you maybe level set for us how much of the auto book is open for new business and how much of the homeowners' book is open for new business?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure. Maybe I'll just step back and give a little broader context in addition. So I would say that we are open for new business in most geographies across the country. And then within that, we have some very specific constraints. On the auto side, we're open for new business in virtually every state. Again, we have a more limited appetite in a couple of key geographies there. Related to whether or not we think we have rate adequacy. But at this point, we're talking less than a handful of states we have those challenges. The property answer is a little more complicated because in property, I've really got three primary issues that we're working through in terms of managing and thoughtfully deploying our property capacities. First is overall profitability. As we've talked about, property is a little bit behind auto in terms of reaching target margins on a state-by-state basis, and so we're managing that. Second is catastrophe exposure and then third is local market concentration of exposure. And so predominantly in property, the places that we are not open for new business fall into those last two categories. You know, we have some specific local geography where we've got outsized market share that we're working to manage down. And then we've got our, you know, sort of, continued optimization of risk and reward as respects catastrophe losses. So that's the color behind it. But I would say, you know, the places that were literally closed for new business are pretty limited. But that more broadly, it's a matter of monitoring and thoughtfully deploying the property capacity in many of those markets.\n\nAndrew Anderson - Analyst (Jefferies):\nThank you. Then just on workers' comp, it looks like it was down 7% year over year. I wouldn't think that's impacted by the casualty reinsurance program, but could you maybe just talk about the pricing that you're seeing there and maybe growth in that market?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President of Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYes. Yeah. Andrew, this is Greg. Yeah. You know, we can comp comp side of the business. So that's what's driving that. You know, fluctuations from quarter to quarter, of course, like audit premium. And audit premium, I just wanna comment on audit premium that goes into net written premium is the change in audit premium. We had historically high levels last year. We still have strong levels of audit premium. That change also factored into that.\n\nAndrew Anderson - Analyst (Jefferies):"

Citrus in California, I guess, a bit of a headwind when it comes to growth. Are you seeing any other geographies for the homeowners that maybe could help you offset that, maybe a geography where you're not really big. Thinking maybe we think Florida is improving a bit from a low base. Are you seeing any offsets that could maybe allow you to grow this in homeowners?\n\nMichael Klein - President of Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Thanks for the question. I would say, you know, to take that question and link it back to my response to the previous one, California certainly is a distinct example of where we're constraining property capacity, but it's not the only one. We have a number of states particularly in the south and in the Midwest, where we're constraining property capacity for the reasons that I mentioned. And, again, most of the time, that's limiting growth. But in some of those cases, it's nonrenewing business in areas where we've got too much concentration. That said, to your point, there are places where we're open for business in both property and auto. And I think that you see that contributing to the new business growth in auto this quarter. Because we are seeing new business growth in those places. It is important to remember, I think, when you think about our line of business growth and production, that we're essentially fifty-fifty property and auto. And so we're different from most participants in the industry. Our actions in property given that mix of business and given our tendency to package auto and property, does mean that our property actions are gonna have an impact on our ability to grow auto. But really at the end of the day, we focus on each state individually looking at the auto and property opportunities and the opportunity to best manage the portfolio. And we are working to take advantage of those places where we don't have the constraints to help support auto and overall portfolio growth.\n\nKaveh Monteseri - Analyst (Deutsche Bank):\nThank you. And my follow-up is on the reserve releases in workers' comp. Could you guys give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of medical claims inflation versus your own assumptions?\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure. So that's continued to behave pretty well for us. And we've made the comment a bunch of times, but it's worth reiterating, you know, that the long-tail nature of comp just means you can't afford to get behind on the assumptions that you're making. So even though we've seen medical cost inflation come in benign to what we had allowed for, we've been pretty reluctant to make a fundamental change to our longer-term view that we're baking into our pricing assumptions and our reserving action. So another quarter where you saw some good news in medical severity, and again, our view is we continue to assume that that is gonna return to some higher normal by historical standard level of inflation on a go-forward basis.\n\nKaveh Monteseri - Analyst (Deutsche Bank):"

I think a lot of the questions I have are asked, but maybe one on commercial auto. I know that you talked about auto PYD as a whole. But if we look at statutory disclosures on commercial auto, as well as your like, a variety of other data. For example, your 10-Q, claims and claims adjusted expenses data and things of that nature. Industry seems to be facing continued headwind from litigation cost and reserve challenges. But it seems like you're holding up fairly okay. Just curious how you think about commercial auto. The industry, but also as well as for yourself going forward. Maybe some commentaries around that.\n\nDan Frey - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Bob, it's Dan. So I'll focus on us rather than the industry. Commercial auto, you know, was a challenge when we started talking about inflation back in 2018, 2019. We really haven't called had much mention of commercial auto in the last couple years really because I think we've reached a point where we started to make sure that we were reviewing and assessing the data as it came in informed by what we went through in 2018 and 2019. And as a result, to your observation, we really haven't had to do much in the way of changing those estimates in the last couple years as to whether or not the industry is in a good place from a reserving perspective. I'm not sure. One thing, you know, that we are sure about the industry in commercial auto is it continues to need price because returns on that line still aren't where we'd like them to be. But as you heard Greg say again today, we continue to get price there. But feel good about where we are on the balance sheet. Just that we have a new commercial auto product that is out in the market, and we feel terrific about it.\n\nBob Hwang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nExcellent. Thanks. I got a my next one is kind of a long-winded attack question. So if you think about the capabilities you've mentioned, right, enhanced digital capabilities, streamline workflow, cyber risk policies, how much of the capabilities are contingent on in-house software development, how much of it is based on third-party capabilities? I guess the way I'm thinking about it is that if we go back to how much we think about maintenance tech versus new technology spend, like, does that ratio eventually change to the point where don't have to spend as much on maintenance technology going forward? Just kinda curious on your tech strategy thoughts there, if that makes sense at all.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYep. Bob, I think your premise is right. I'm not gonna quantify how much is in which bucket. I will say that anytime we're investing in a capability, we analyze whether there's a proprietary benefit to us developing it and owning it. And when there is a proprietary benefit, we do that. When there's not a proprietary benefit, we're, you know, happy to source it from third parties. So I do think the trend you're describing, you know, probably is a fair one. And we'll continue to drive the favorable mix of our investment spending.\n\nBob Hwang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):"

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to The Travelers Companies, Inc. discussion of our second quarter 2025 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our three segment presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeffrey Klenk of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-Ks filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may use some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report exceptional second quarter results, driven by excellent underwriting and investment performance. We earned core income of $1.5 billion or $6.51 per diluted share. Core return on equity for the quarter was 18.8%, bringing our core return on equity for the trailing twelve months to 17.1%. Underwriting income reflects strong net earned premiums and a reported combined ratio that improved almost 10 points to 90.3%. The improvement in the combined ratio benefited from strength across the board, as lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting results, and favorable prior year reserve development all contributed. Underlying underwriting income of $1.6 billion pretax was up 35% over the prior year quarter, driven by 7% growth in net earned premiums to $10.9 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved three points to an excellent 84.7%. All three segments contributed to these terrific results with strong net earned premiums and excellent reported and underlying profitability. Underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance improved by almost one point to an excellent 88.3%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond and Specialty business was a very strong 87.8%. And the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved by seven points to a terrific 79.3%. Our high-quality investment portfolio also continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $774 million for the quarter, driven by reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return more than $800 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $557 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share was up by more than 14% as compared to a year ago. Turning to the top line, through skilled execution by our field organization, we grew net written premiums to $11.5 billion in the quarter, with growth in all three segments. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 5% to $5.8 billion. Renewal premium change remained strong at 7.7%, with renewal premium change of 8.6% in our core middle market business, and 10.7% in our small commercial select business. Those two markets make up 70% of the net written premiums in Business Insurance. Given the high quality of the book, we were very pleased with strong retention of 85% in this segment. New business was a record $744 million, a reflection of the relationships we've built with customers and distribution partners by delivering valued products, services, and experiences. In Bond and Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 4% to $1.1 billion, with retention of 87% in our high-quality management liability business. In our industry-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by 5%, from a particularly strong result in the prior year quarter. In Personal Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 3% to $4.7 billion, driven by strong renewal premium change in our homeowners business. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. In May, we announced an agreement to sell most of our Canadian business to Definity for $2.4 billion or 1.8 times book value, excluding excess local capital. As we noted at the time, the transaction does not include our premier surety business. We also shared that we expect to allocate about $700 million of the net cash proceeds for additional share repurchases in 2026 and that we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in each of the next several years. While it's a relatively small transaction for us, it's noteworthy in reflecting an important point. We are relentless in our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and value creation. Taking a step back, the Canadian marketplace has evolved over the last decade or so in a few significant ways. First, a small number of insurers have built significant scale and market influence, in part through vertical integration with distribution. There were no compelling inorganic opportunities for us to close the market share gap, and we didn't see vertical integration as a realistic opportunity for us. Also, the regulatory environment has become more challenging. While we were confident that we could continue to manage successfully in Canada, the outlook for our Canadian business relative to our other businesses, combined with a very attractive offer from a strategic buyer, made reallocating the capital the better decision. Disciplined capital management isn't only about deciding how to deploy the marginal dollar. It's also about continually and rigorously reassessing the capital we have already deployed and whether it's still delivering the best long-term value. I want to thank our outstanding team in Canada and recognize the value they created over many years. I'm confident that they and our Canadian customers and brokers will benefit from being part of one of the country's leading and fully integrated property casualty insurers. I also want to reaffirm our commitment to our ongoing international businesses. This deal is not part of a broader geographic repositioning; it's simply a smart transaction. The transaction speaks volumes about the way "

The transaction speaks volumes about the way we think about our business. At The Travelers Companies, Inc., we're optimizers, relentlessly focused on ensuring that both our capital and our retention are invested where we can generate attractive returns, profitable growth, and the greatest long-term value for our shareholders. To sum things up, our results for the first half of the year reflect exceptional underwriting performance, record operating cash flow, and steadily rising investment returns in our growing fixed income portfolio. We're building on the strong momentum through continued discipline of our proven strategy. With our diversified business operating from a position of strength, our outlook for continued premium growth with attractive underwriting margins, orderly conditions generally in our target markets, and a positive trajectory for investment income, we remain highly confident in the outlook for our business. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThank you, Alan. We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, both overall and by segment. We generated higher earned premiums and meaningfully improved both the reported and underlying combined ratios compared to the prior year quarter. At 84.7%, the underlying combined ratio marked its third consecutive quarter below 85. The combination of higher premiums and the excellent underlying combined ratio led to our fourth consecutive quarter with after-tax underlying underwriting income of more than $1 billion, up $339 million or 36% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 28.6%, 20 basis points better than last year's second quarter and in line with our expectations. That brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.4%, and we continue to expect a full-year expense ratio of 28% to 28.5%. As we've discussed previously, the second quarter is historically our most active cat period. This year, however, our pretax cat losses of $927 million or 8.5 combined ratio points, while significant, were nearly four points less than the second quarter cat plan we shared with you during our year-end earnings call in January. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $315 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $79 million pretax was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, partially offset by reserve additions in our runoff book related to environmental, abuse, and other long-tail exposures, with no single adjustment being particularly noteworthy. In Bond and Specialty, net favorable PYD was $81 million pretax, with favorability in Fidelity and surety. Personal Insurance had net favorable PYD of $155 million pretax, driven by recent accident years in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income of $774 million increased by 6% from the prior year quarter. As expected, fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher invested assets and higher average yields. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were positive but not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Notably, for the first time, total invested assets surpassed $100 billion, excluding the net unrealized loss. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, has increased from the outlook we provided a quarter ago. We now expect approximately $770 million after tax in the third quarter, and $805 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30 are more than 100 basis points above the yield embedded in the portfolio. Fixed income NII should continue to increase beyond 2025 as the portfolio continues to grow and gradually turns over, with higher yields replacing maturing yields. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.3 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. This marks our twenty-first consecutive quarter with operating cash flows of more than $1 billion, totaling more than $40 billion over that time frame. Interest rates decreased during the quarter; as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3.3 billion after tax at March 31 to $3 billion after tax at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $144.57 at quarter end, up 4% from year-end and up 14% from a year ago. We returned $809 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $557 million and dividends of $252 million. And we have approximately $4.3 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Turning to reinsurance, page 18 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1 reinsurance placements. We renewed our Northeast property cat XOL treaty, which continues to provide $1 billion of occurrence coverage above the attachment point of $2.75 billion. We also replaced our personal insurance coastal hurricane cat XOL treaty with an all-perils countrywide personal insurance treaty that provides 50% occurrence coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1 billion. You may recall that last year's treaty had an attachment point of $2 billion. While in a modeled year, we wouldn't expect this to have much of an impact given the prospect of continued weather volatility, we were pleased to obtain broader coverage at a reasonable cost. Recapping our results, Q2 was another quarter of continued premium growth in all three segments. The quarter also featured excellent underwriting profitability, both on an underlying and as-reported basis, and rising net investment income. These strong fundamentals delivered core return on equity of 18.8% for the quarter and 17.1% on a trailing twelve-month basis, and position us very well to continue delivering strong returns in the future. And now for a discussion of results in Business Insurance, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a very strong second quarter, delivering segment income of $813 million, up nearly 25% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher net earned premiums and a combined ratio that improved 2.5 points from the prior year quarter to a terrific 93.6%. The improvement was broad-based, reflecting higher underlying underwriting income, higher favorable prior year reserve development, higher net investment income, and lower catastrophes. We're extremely pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 88.3%, which improved from the prior year by almost a point, driven by the benefit of earned pricing. Moving to the top line, our net written premiums increased 5% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.8 billion, led by strong growth of 10% in our core middle market business. This was partially offset by a 3% decline in net written premiums in National Property and Other, reflecting our disciplined underwriting. As for production across the segment, pricing remains strong with renewal premium change of nearly 8%, driven by renewal rate change of 5.3%. Renewal rate change and renewal premium change in every line other than CMP and property were about the same or higher compared to the first quarter. Renewal premium change in both umbrella and auto were both well into double digits. Renewal premium change in CMP was a little lower but remained in the double digits. The decline in renewal premium change in property was driven by national property, reflecting the outlook for continued attractive returns after several years of compounding price increases and impr"

The decline in renewal premium change in property was driven by national property, reflecting the outlook for continued attractive returns after several years of compounding price increases and improvements in terms and conditions. Renewal premium change in the property line outside of national property was down some but remained solid. Retention across the segment remained excellent at 85%. Retention in middle market was strong, while retention in our national property business was a bit lower as we ceded some large accounts to the subscription market on terms and pricing that we weren't willing to accept. Lastly, new business of $744 million was a new quarterly record. We're pleased with these production results and particularly our field segmented execution. Our proven strategy focuses on managing our business in a granular manner, balancing retaining our high-quality book of business while obtaining appropriate pricing. Our rate and retention results this quarter reflect excellent execution, aligning rates, terms, and conditions with environmental trends for each line. Our continued high retention levels are an indication of a rational marketplace. We believe our execution is differentiating. It's the best people in the business powered by the best analytics and tools at the point of sale that deliver these segmented production results, ultimately producing these strong returns across Business Insurance. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remains strong at nearly 11%, marking the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit renewal premium change. Renewal rate change of 5.3% was in line with the prior year level. As we expected, retention was stable at 80%, reflecting our targeted CMP risk-return optimization efforts, which will begin to wind down next quarter. New business of $148 million continues to benefit from our industry-leading product offerings, including Bot 2.0, and our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 42 states. In our core middle market business, renewal premium change also remained strong at almost 9%. Renewal rate change of 7.1% was up a bit from the second quarter of last year, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business of $430 million was a second-quarter record. To sum up, Business Insurance had another outstanding quarter. We continue to grow our quality book of business while investing in differentiating capabilities that position us for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Greg. Bond and Specialty posted another very strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $244 million and an outstanding combined ratio of 80.3% in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was strong at 87.8%, up modestly driven by the impact of earned price on our management liability business. Turning to the top line, we're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 4% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, renewal premium change improved to 3.2% while retention remained strong at 87%. These results reflect our intentional and segmented initiatives to improve pricing given the loss environment. As expected, new business was lower than the second quarter of 2024. As a reminder, Corbus production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter and is now mostly reflected as renewal premium. Comparisons to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted for the remainder of the year. Turning to our market-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by 5% from a very strong level in the prior year quarter, reflecting continued robust demand for our surety products and services. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits of our value-added approach and market-leading competitive advantages. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share that Personal Insurance delivered segment income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2025. Significantly improved underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year development contributed to this excellent bottom line result. The combined ratio of 88.4% improved 20 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven by a decrease in catastrophe losses of nearly 14 points and a seven-point improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio was 79.3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions we've taken to improve the fundamentals of our business in both auto and homeowners. Net written premiums grew 3% in the quarter, driven by higher renewal premium change in homeowners. In automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 85.3% and included a five-point benefit from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 89% improved 6.2 points compared to the second quarter of the prior year. This improvement was driven by favorable loss experience across both bodily injury and vehicle coverages, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of higher earned pricing. In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio of 91.3% was a significant improvement compared to the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophes and strong underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 70.3% improved over seven points compared to the second quarter of 2024. This year-over-year improvement was driven by both favorable non-catastrophic weather losses and the continued benefit of earned pricing. Turning to production, our results reflect further progress toward positioning our diversified portfolio to deliver long-term profitable growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent periods. Renewal premium change continues to moderate as intended, reflecting improved profitability and our focus on returning to profitable growth in auto. We're pleased to note that auto new business premium increased 12%. In addition, for the first time in more than a year, we wrote more new business policies than in the prior year quarter. The new business momentum was primarily driven by our continued efforts to improve auto growth. The relaxing of some of our property restrictions also contributed to the new business momentum in auto. In domestic homeowners and other, retention remained relatively consistent. Renewal premium change of 19.3% reflects our continued actions to align insured values with rising replacement costs and secure rate increases in geographies where we have the need. The decline in homeowners policies in force continues to be a result of our deliberate actions to manage exposures in high cat risk geographies. We're pleased with the progress we've made. While we will maintain restrictions on property capacity where we can't achieve appropriate risk-reward, we expect to relax many of our rate and non-rate actions in most markets by the end of 2025. To sum it up, this was a great quarter. We delivered strong segment income as our team continued to improve the fundamentals of our business while further positioning our portfolio for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nGreat. Thanks, Michael.

We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGood morning, everyone. So I think for the first question, I'll zero in on business insurance and pricing. Looking at the renewal premium change both in business insurance ex-national accounts and select accounts in middle market, I feel like pricing's holding up pretty good. Maybe there's some pockets of weakness that you're seeing or some pressure. But Greg, in your comments, you talked about in the large national account market, losing some accounts to the subscription market. When you talk about the pricing environment, how much of the select or middle market business has exposure to potential market price competition? And, you know, and just some additional color on where you're seeing pricing pressure in the middle markets business.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYes. Good morning, Greg. Yes. First of all, it wasn't cash. It was national property that I referenced. And so, yeah, typically, you would see, you know, a shared in layer a large property schedule be built into a tower and definitely seeing that some of the softer element of the property business, in those larger schedules. That would leak a little bit into the top end of middle market, but not much and not be relevant for Select. \n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nGreg, just to come back and paint a picture here. And I think Greg laid out a lot of detail in his answer, but just to create the context again, I think as he shared, price in national property was lower. Workers' comp pricing was about the same, but price change in every other line including the component of property that's outside of the national property business, was actually quite strong. And in that context, I would also point to retention which we've always shared as a real indicator of market stability. So you know, we are quite comfortable with the very, very strong execution.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOh, that's apparent in slide seven on your ROE slide. Can I pivot to the personal lines business? And I think Michael, you said in your comments, you're gonna relax some restrictions by the end of the year? Can you sort of foreshadow what that looks like in terms of premium production or how that might affect either your renewal, your retention rates, or your policy count growth?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSure, Greg. Thanks for the question. I think, you know, the reason I made the comments around the plans to relax some of our restrictions in property by year-end was just to give you a little bit of a feel for the progress that we're making. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our progress there. And we continue to see progress in our ability to improve profitability and manage volatility in the property line. The other reason I mentioned it is as we've talked about in the past, those property actions have been a headwind to auto production. And so while most of our progress this quarter in auto really was a direct result of our efforts to grow auto, some of the states we've begun to relax have also shown signs of progress in auto growth. So the point there on the property side is we've got a game plan in terms of the places we need to reduce exposure to manage volatility. We've got a game plan in terms of pricing, in terms of conditions we need to make changes to improve profitability. And we're making good progress in executing that plan and most of those actions should be completed by the end of 2025.\n\nOperator - Operator (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):"

How concerned are you about the durability of that? And if some of that weakness that you're seeing in large account, national account property starts to trickle down more into middle market and even further down?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYes. David, I think it's sort of missing the forest for the trees. I mean, the overall landscape is very positive and really consistent with what we're seeing in terms of returns. Now you know, we would expect the overall property market to sort of move in a direction. But historically, the property outside of national property has just performed differently as you'd expect.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. Thank you. And then maybe, just a follow-up question for Greg. So on the business insurance underlying loss ratio, very strong at the 58.4%. I think in 2Q last year, there was about one point of light non-cat weather. Any of that happen again this year in the second quarter that may have flattered the results a little bit? Or is this sort of a cleaner number?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nDavid, it's Dan. I'll take that. So you're right in remembering that we did point out a little bit of favorability in last year's quarter. We saw a little bit of favorability again in this year's quarter. I don't know if it's a new normal, but we've now seen several quarters where we've had a little bit of favorability there. Again, it wasn't a big component last year. So, yes, we see, you know, a little bit of favorability again this year, but plus or minus a point, the combined ratio is still outstanding in business insurance.\n\nOperator - Operator (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):"

Brian, the tort inflation is alive and well. Hasn't gone anywhere and continues to show up in the numbers. I would say you know, we've got an expectation for it. We're pricing for it. Appears the whole market's pricing for it. If you look at what pricing's doing, and so, you know, all the social inflation we see is inside the numbers that you're looking at.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. So you're pricing for it is not having much effect on margins. Okay. Second one, Michael, I'm just curious. I appreciate the comments about what's going on with personal auto. Do you expect kind of retention to kind of trend back towards, call it, the mid-eighties? It's kind of, I think, where personal auto has been. Is that kind of where we should think about things heading?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah, Brian. I think it's a great question. Certainly, you're right to recall that historically in auto, we've would have run more, say, an 84 retention versus an 82. I would tell you that you know, coming into 2025, our expectation was we would have seen retention recover as pricing moderated. Clearly, you haven't seen that in the numbers. I think that's reflective of the overall competitive environment in auto. But we continue to focus on both new business production and retention improvement as we see margins in auto continue to improve. So again, our focus is on returning auto to growth and we've got a number of efforts underway to drive that. But we are still a couple of points off the historical run rate of retention in auto.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

How confident are you that there's no maybe telematics related adverse selection if you're growing a new business, but retention hasn't yet come back to where you expected?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nI think it's a good question, Meyer. I would tell you that you know, underneath the production levels that we're generating, you know, we look at retained business. We look at new business. We look at the profile underneath it. We don't see any signs of adverse selection in our profile metrics for either the business we're retaining or the new business we're writing. So we really don't see any evidence of that.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay. Excellent. And then I guess, Roland, and on the commercial side, is there any sense that when lines of business soften in sort of the current cycle, and I know it's very line of business specific, does it seem to be softening faster than we've seen after past hard markets? I know right now we're focused on property and, you know, a couple of years ago, but I'm wondering whether there's a theme there of this sort of rapid softening that we hadn't seen.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nNot I'm not sure I get the question, Meyer, but I don't think so. What's your hypothesis? That it's softening faster because of what?\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nSo I'm not sure what the because of it would be. But in the past, you'd have, like, very sudden and abrupt rate increases when the market got hard, and then it would totally soften. And the problem was that it softened for too many years at a moderate level. And I'm wondering whether for the lines of business are seeing softening now, whether it's moving faster than it had in the past. I have no good suggestion in terms of why that would be happening. I'm just wondering if it's happening.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. I think the bigger trends here, if you look back over a very long period of time, the amplitude of the pricing cycle, I think, is shrinking. You know, the last time we made a bottom, we didn't really go below zero and price has been positive for years now in most lines. The other dynamic you see really is dispersion of pricing by line as a function of rate adequacy and returns. And so that's really what I think we're seeing. I think it's less of some market dynamics. And big shifts up or down. I think it's pretty rational relative to what we're seeing in terms of returns.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay. Perfect. That's very helpful.

I think for the whole industry, you know, some of the growth in property over the last couple of years has been pretty helpful for underlying margins at least. Even overall margins. Would you expect over the next twelve months just given what's going on with property and that being a little bit more pressure in terms of price, would you expect any reversal in that? Any help you can provide us in just making sure we're capturing that dynamic over the next twelve months?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah, Alex. It's Dan. So you know, we give you every quarter written premium by product in business insurance. And we did make the comment maybe a year, maybe a year and a half ago or so when property was growing faster than the rest of the book largely because of significant price increases that were occurring, but we're also taking some new business that had a modest benefit to margin and mix. And maybe a quarter or two ago, we got a question of, you know, has that sort of gone away as the level of price increase in national property has moderated? To which the answer was yes. And if you look at property growth now, it is no longer outsized relative to business insurance overall. So the short answer is it doesn't have much of an impact in terms of mix change. It was never big enough that we actually called it on any meaningful way, but it was a slight good guy maybe a year and a half ago, and that's sort of gone away. But that's inside of the terrific results we just posted this quarter.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. Helpful. Second one I have is on workers' comp. I was just interested if you're seeing any impact from some of the heightened claim environment in California, I think, related to cumulative trauma claims and so forth. And also maybe just broadly, if some of the medical cost pressures that we're hearing from the health insurers talking about are finding their way into workers' comp loss concern at all?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nHey, Alex. Yeah, this is Greg. Regarding cumulative trauma, you had clearly, we're seeing that in California, and it's not a new quarterly trend. It's something we've been seeing for a few years now. We've been very responsive with underwriting and claim strategies to make sure we're managing that dynamic. I think if you look at the overall rate indications of the bureau in the state that are just been approved, the cumulative trauma is definitely a dynamic underneath that. So I think it's just a good exemplar where, again, you know, our evidence-based culture and our collaboration has us in a really well-positioned position right now. Alex, the thing I got generally on workers' comp is loss trend continues to come in favorable to our expectations. And consistent with, you know, the trends we've been seeing, you know, really over a couple of years.\n\nOperator - Operator (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):"

Good morning, Wes. Yeah. We're not gonna give you an outlook in terms of where, you know, middle market pricing is going to go. I'll just give you some color underneath that, Ken. You pointed out the two well, the three dynamics. We have strong rate exposure change that's driving good premium change. And then retention continues to be near historical highs on that business, which I think just demonstrates the strong value that we're bringing out into the marketplace. And new business. Our underwriters have been incredibly active in the marketplace, and you put those three into action in the quarter, and you get a terrific number like 10%.\n\nWes Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nThanks. Fair enough. And maybe just coming back on social inflation and loss cost. For Travelers, is this as pronounced in middle and small accounts as it is for national? And I guess if there is a discrepancy, is there any way to think about it in terms of rule of thumb and differences in loss cost trend?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. I do think that you've probably seen it maybe a little bit more pronounced in larger business where there are larger limits involved and it's a more potentially attractive target for the plaintiff's bar.

And that shouldn't be surprising where inflation trends have been coming down also. So I think it's more linear with the longer-term economy than anything short-term right now.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Cantor Fitzgerald):\nAnd I guess just one for Dan. On the sale of the Canada business, should we think about that as having any type of formal impact on the combined expense ratio, the underlying loss guess, of these other figures?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. Not much of an impact, Ryan. So for two reasons. One is just a very small component of the overall mix of our business. So, you know, the inclusion or exclusion of those results is we don't expect to have a significant impact on margin really one way or the other. Which is one of the reasons that, you know, we said when we announced the deal, we expect it to have a favorable but modestly favorable impact on EPS going forward.\n\nOperator - Operator (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):"

And irregardless of whether you pick the M&A bucket, maybe, Alan, you can just, you know, kind of give us, you know, a current update on just views surrounding M&A.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nSo you can just think about that capital as being reallocated to our other capital needs of supporting our business, supporting our growth, supporting other capital objectives that we have. It's not really big enough to change our view towards M&A one way or the other, frankly. So I don't think it makes M&A either more or less likely. But we continue to be very active in looking for things that would meet our objectives. And as we've been pretty consistent about for a long time, we would be interested in opportunities that would improve our return profile, improve volatility, or provide us with other strategic capabilities. So there's really no change to our M&A strategy or approach.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my follow-up, you know, is kind of coming back to just, you know, medical inflation. Now are there any considerations from the OBB legislation? And then obviously, we've seen combined with just the fact that we've seen some companies already point to higher utilization stemming, you know, from some changes in Medicaid availability.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nWe really haven't seen any nor would we expect any significant or even meaningful impact from Medicaid at all. Typically, workers' comp claims tend to come from people that are employed and aren't on Medicaid. So that wouldn't be an issue. And even if you have somebody who was both employed and on Medicaid, they almost always default to workers' comp anyway because it's a better healthcare alternative for them. So there's really nothing in OBB or in the Medicaid world generally that we think is impacting workers' comp.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nAnd the one thing I'll add, Elyse, there was a change to the Medicare fee schedule, but that was within expectations and historical norms, so no surprises for that either.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

Was that mainly linked to market volatility in April and the proceeds that you had from Canada? Or should we think of that level as being kind of a new baseline going forward?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nHey. It's Dan. So a couple of things on that. So one, we don't have proceeds from the Canada transaction. We said we'd expect that transaction to close in the early part of 2026. So that's when you'd see the incremental $700 million for share repurchases sort of start to become available. Second, we don't really forecast a level of share repurchases. What we're doing is rightsizing capital. And so also related to the first part of your question, we're really not market timing in terms of what the stock price is at any given moment. We have a long-term view of stock price, intrinsic value, likely growth in book value, our view of what stock price is likely to be, and is when we reach a point where we have excess capital, because we continue to generate excess capital. As Alan just said, we'll look for opportunities to deploy it either to grow the business organically, to look for inorganic opportunities, and make new strategic investments. When we've exhausted all those opportunities, it's not our capital, it's investors, and we're going to return it to shareholders. But that's really what we're doing, and we're not leaning in or leaning out based on stock price at any particular moment as long as we're comfortable that the value relative to our view of long-term is still there.\n\nKaveh Monteseri - Analyst (Deutsche Bank):\nOkay. And then if I could pivot to personal lines, you did mention relaxing some restrictions on the property side and did say it's going to have an impact on rates and non-rate actions by year-end. But does that also include relaxing the ratio of how much business you write in property versus auto? I think you did mention in the past that you would like them to move in line just to keep a pretty good balance in your portfolio between the two. Is that changing as well? Would you be more likely to write more auto even if you can't write as much on the property side? Or that's no change to that view.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYes. So this is Michael. Thanks for the question. I think when we've talked about shifting the mix of business in the past and the mix of the portfolio in the past, our focus really has been shifting it more toward auto to get the portfolio back in balance between auto and property. When you look at the PIF changes over time, you see progress in that regard. Right? While we do still see a reduction in auto PIF, it's about 25% of the reduction in property. So that demonstrates progress in mixing toward property. As we Sorry. I'm making towards auto. As we relax the restrictions in property, our goal would be to deploy that property capacity in support of writing package business, which is our primary strategy in personal insurance. And so we would expect that the relaxing of some of the property restrictions to bring with it both property and auto opportunities as we look forward.\n\nOperator - Operator (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nWe have time for one more question, and that question comes from the line of Vikram Gandhi with HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nVikram Gandhi - Analyst (HSBC):\nHi. Morning, everybody. My question relates to cyber. If you guys are seeing any signs of more moderation in the rate reductions for cyber? Whether any of the recent losses might help down the sentiment for the better.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nHi. Good morning. This is Jeff Klenk. I'd say that cyber remains a competitive price environment from a market perspective. As I pointed out in my prepared remarks, inside our management liability business, we've been taking some segmented and disciplined focus on a couple of specific lines of business. Cyber is one of those that we believe the loss environment is not fully reflected in the pricing in the marketplace. So that's our perspective on it. What it means for the future of that market, I wouldn't forecast.\n\nVikram Gandhi - Analyst (HSBC):\nOkay. Thank you. And my follow-up is related to the investment book. So in terms of the ratings mix for the investment portfolio, I see a notable downward movement from the triple-A bucket to double-A. I'm assuming that would have been driven by the Moody's action on The US. Could you confirm if that was indeed the case? And what does that do to your capital model and the capital requirements on your internal model?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (The Travelers Companies, Inc.):\nYeah. It's Dan. So that's correct. That's the driver. Both levels of credit quality are still super strong. We're very comfortable with the overall mix of the portfolio and the overall credit rating of the portfolio. We're well within our internal guidelines and really don't view the US government credits as necessarily any less likely to be collected than they were previously. So it's moved down one notch. You're correct. That's the driver. And not really a level of concern for us.\n\nVikram Gandhi - Analyst (HSBC):"

Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2020 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers. Com under the investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer chairman and CEO Dan Frey CFO and our three segment presidents. Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-Ks filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report excellent third-quarter results. We earned core income of $1.9 billion or $8.14 per diluted share. Our return on equity for the quarter was 22.6%, bringing our core return on equity for the trailing twelve months to 18.7%. Very strong underwriting results and higher investment income drove the bottom line. Underwriting income of $1.4 billion pretax more than doubled compared to the prior year quarter, benefiting from both the lower level of catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying result was driven by higher net earned premiums and an underlying combined ratio that improved 1.7 points to an exceptional 83.9%. Underwriting income was higher in all three segments. Our high-quality investment portfolio also continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $850 million for the quarter, up 15%, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return almost $900 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $628 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share was up 15% compared to a year ago. With strong results over the past year and a particularly light cat quarter, we have a higher than usual level of excess capital and liquidity. Consequently, we anticipate a higher level of share repurchase over the next couple of quarters. Dan will have more to say about that in a minute. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums to $11.5 billion in the quarter. In business insurance, we grew net written premiums by 3% to $5.7 billion, led by 4% growth in our domestic business. Excluding the property line, we grew domestic net written premiums in the segment by more than 6%. The declining premium volume in property continues to be a large account dynamic. In fact, we grew property in both middle market and small commercial. We've seen this dynamic in the large property market before, and we won't compromise our underwriting discipline. Over time, particularly as catastrophic events inevitably unfold, the value of that discipline and the cost to those who abandon it will become unmistakable. Renewal premium and change in business insurance was 7.1%, driven by continued historically high RPC in our middle market and select business businesses. Excluding the property line, renewal premium change in the segment was a very strong 9%, and renewal rate change was a very strong 6.7%. Greg will share additional detail by line. Retention in the segment was 85%. Given the high quality of the book, we were very pleased with that result. In Bond and Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums to $1.1 billion with higher renewal premium change and continued strong retention of 87% in our high-quality management liability business. Net written premiums in our market-leading surety business remained strong. In personal insurance, written premiums were $4.7 billion with strong renewal premium change in our homeowners business. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. As we head toward the end of the year, our planning for 2026 is well underway. As always, that process involves assessing the environment ahead. There are uncertainties out there: economic, political, geopolitical, not to mention the loss environment. We are very confident that we're built and very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We're operating from a position of considerable strength. Profitability is strong, reflecting our leading underwriting expertise and the operating leverage we've built through a sustained focus on productivity and efficiency. Our competitive advantages have never been stronger or more relevant. Strong underwriting is the flywheel that sets everything in motion. Our premium growth at attractive margins has generated strong cash flow, which enables us to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders, and grow our investment portfolio. Since 2016, we have successfully invested $13 billion in technology, returned more than $20 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, and grown our investment portfolio by nearly 50% to more than $100 billion. Scale matters, increasingly so. We have the scale to win in an environment where technology and AI will continue to segment the marketplace. We have a track record of identifying the right strategic priorities and driving value from them. You can see that in the 300 basis point reduction we've achieved in our expense ratio since 2016, even while we were significantly increasing our overall technology spend. Importantly, our size gives us the data to power AI, creating a virtuous cycle: better insights, better decisions, better outcomes, more resources to invest. For example, our long-time focus on organizing and curating data has given us access to more than 65 billion clean data points from decades of history across multiple business lines. We leverage that to sharpen our underwriting and shape our claim strategies. With the vast majority of our business in North America, we hold a leading position in the largest and most stable insurance market in the world, an advantage that insulates us from much of the risk arising from the economic instability and geopolitical uncertainty around the globe.

Our fortress balance sheet and exceptional cash flow provide us with the financial strength to invest consistently in the business regardless of the external conditions. Our financial strength also enables us to manage comfortably through large loss events like the January California wildfires. When it comes to the loss environment, from weather volatility to the impact of social inflation on casualty lines, no one is better positioned. Diversification provides powerful protection. In fact, our business mix produces a consolidated loss ratio that's actually less volatile than the loss ratio of our least volatile segment. That's the power of a balanced and diversified portfolio. Equally important is our demonstrated ability to confront the loss environment head-on. We have the data, the analytics, and the discipline to establish reserves and loss picks appropriately and generally ahead of the market. That matters because until you have an accurate view of the loss environment, your risk selection, underwriting, and claim strategies are all operating with the wrong inputs. Since our early identification of the acceleration of social inflation in 2019, we've grown the business and delivered significantly improved margins. Getting an accurate and timely view of the loss environment isn't just about the balance sheet. It's foundational to running the business effectively. Our internally managed investment portfolio was another source of strength. Our disciplined focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns has served us exceptionally well through various markets, especially during periods of market turmoil. More than 90% of our portfolio is in fixed income with an average credit rating of AA. We're highly selective. We don't reach for yield. We hold the vast majority of our fixed income securities to maturity. And we carefully coordinate the duration of our assets and liabilities. The track record speaks for itself. Our default rates during the most challenging environments over the past two decades were a fraction of industry averages. This consistency comes from a world-class investment team, with extraordinary tenure and a shared long-term perspective. In short, the franchise we've built, the capabilities we've developed, and our depth of expertise create advantages that are durable across operating environments. Before I wrap up, I'll share that we're just back from one of the industry's premier conferences, where we had the opportunity to meet with dozens of our key agents and brokers, who collectively represent a substantial amount of our business. We left as convinced as ever that our position with the independent distribution channel is an unmatched strategic advantage. We heard clearly that our strategic investments are resonating and that looking ahead, we're focused on the right priorities to extend that advantage. I want to acknowledge and thank all of our distribution partners. I also want to reiterate our unwavering commitment to being an indispensable partner for them and the undeniable choice for their customers. To sum it up, we're very well positioned and very optimistic about the road ahead. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThank you, Alan. In the third quarter, we once again delivered excellent financial results on a consolidated basis and in each of our three segments. Core income for the quarter of $1.9 billion resulted in core return on equity of 22.6%, reflecting both excellent underwriting results and strong investment income. We generated higher levels of written premium and earned premium while delivering excellent combined ratios on both a reported and underlying basis. At 83.9%, the underlying combined ratio marked its fourth consecutive quarter below 85. The combination of higher premiums and the excellent underlying combined ratio led to an 18% increase in after-tax underlying underwriting income, which surpassed $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 28.6%, bringing the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.5%. We continue to expect an expense ratio of around 28% for the full year 2025 and expect to manage to that level again in 2026. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were fairly benign at $42 million pretax, consisting mainly of tornado hail events in the Central United States. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $22 million pretax. In Business Insurance, the annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $277 million. Excluding asbestos, business insurance had net favorable PYD of $152 million driven by continued favorability in workers' comp. In Bond and Specialty, net favorable PYD was $43 million pretax with favorability in Fidelity and Surety. Personal insurance had net favorable PYD of $104 million pretax driven by favorability in auto. After-tax net investment income of $850 million increased by 15% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again the driver of the increase, reflecting both the benefit of higher invested assets and higher average yields. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also up from the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we grew our investment portfolio by approximately $4 billion. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, has increased from the outlook we provided a quarter ago. And we now expect approximately $810 million after tax in the fourth quarter. For 2026, we expect more than $3.3 billion, with quarterly figures starting at around $810 million in Q1 and growing to around $885 million in Q4. New money rates as of September 30 are roughly 70 to 75 basis points above the yield embedded in the portfolio. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter were a new record at $4.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.8 billion. Interest rates decreased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3 billion after tax at June 30 to $2 billion after tax at September 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $150.55 at quarter end, up 8% from year end and up 15% from a year ago. Also of note for Q3, we issued $1.25 billion of debt back in July, with $500 million of ten-year notes and $750 million of thirty-year notes. This was simply ordinary course capital management, maintaining a debt-to-capital ratio in our target range as we continue to grow the business. Sticking with the theme of capital management, we returned $878 million of our capital to shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $628 million and dividends of $250 million. As Alan shared, our very strong earnings over the past year have provided us with an elevated level of capital and liquidity well in excess of what we had planned to use for investment and to support continued growth. As a result, we expect to increase the level of share repurchases in the fourth quarter to roughly $1.3 billion. Also, keep in mind that we previously shared our plan to deploy about $700 million from the sale of our Canadian operations, expected to close in early 2026, for additional share repurchases as well. So if we look across the three-quarter period from Q3 2025 through Q1 2026, our repurchases in Q3 combined with our current outlook for the next two quarters has us repurchasing a total of somewhere around $3.5 billion worth of our stock. Using the average share price over the past thirty days for purchases during the next two quarters, that would result in a reduction of our outstanding share count of about 5% in the nine-month period.

Of course, the actual amount and timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the timing of the closing of the transaction in Canada, actual quarterly earnings, and other factors we disclose in our SEC filings. Recapping our results, Q3 was another quarter of excellent underwriting profitability on both an underlying and as-reported basis, and another quarter of rising net investment income. These strong fundamentals delivered core return on equity of 22.6% for the quarter and 18.7% on a trailing twelve-month basis, and position us very well to continue delivering strong results in the future. And now for a discussion of results in Business Insurance, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a very strong quarter, delivering a record third-quarter segment income of $907 million and an all-in combined ratio of 92.9%. The quarter reflected relatively benign catastrophes and the continued strong contribution from our exceptional underlying underwriting results. This quarter's underlying combined ratio of 88.3% marked the twelfth consecutive quarter where we've produced an underlying combined ratio below 90%. We're pleased that our ongoing strategic investments have contributed to this sustained level of profitability. In particular, through meaningful advancements in data and analytics, we continue to advance our underwriting tools. One specific highlight is the development and utilization of sophisticated models that derive risk characteristics, refine technical pricing, and summarize historical and modeled loss experience, all of which is provided to our underwriters at the point of sale. Moving to the top line, our net written premiums increased to an all-time third-quarter high of $5.7 billion. We grew our leading middle market and select businesses by 7% and 4%, respectively. These two markets make up 70% of the net written premiums in business insurance. We saw a decline in net written premiums in National Property and Other, which, as you heard from Alan, reflects our disciplined execution in terms of risk selection, pricing, and terms and conditions. As for production across the segment, pricing remained attractive with renewal premium change just over 7%. Renewal premium change remains strong in select and middle market. From a line of business perspective, renewal premium change was positive in all lines, double digits in umbrella, CMP, and auto, and up from the second quarter or stable in all lines other than property. As you heard from Alan, excluding the property line, renewal premium change in this segment was 9%. Retention remained excellent at 85%, and new business of $673 million was about flat to a very strong prior year level. We're very pleased with these production results and particularly our field's execution for our proven segmentation strategy. Across the book, pricing and retention results this quarter reflect excellent execution, aligning price, terms, and conditions with environmental trends for each lot. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change of 10.8% was about flat with the second quarter. Retention ticked up as expected as we near completion of our targeted CMP risk return optimization efforts. And lastly, for Select, we generated new business of $134 million, up 3% over the prior year. As we've mentioned previously, we've made meaningful strategic investments in this market in both product and user experience. Our new BOP and auto products have been well received in the market, and we're pleased that the industry-leading segmentation contained in both products is contributing to profitable growth. We're also very pleased with the success of Travis, our digital experience platform for our distribution partners. As we continue our strategic rollout, Travis is already producing over 1 million transactions annually. In our core middle market business, renewal premium change of 8.3% was also about flat sequentially from the second quarter. Price increases remain broad-based as we achieved higher prices on more than three-quarters of our middle market accounts. And at the same time, the granular execution was excellent, with meaningful spread from our best-performing accounts to our lower-performing accounts. We're pleased that retention of 88% remained exceptional given the level of price increases we achieved. And finally, new business of $391 million was our highest ever third-quarter result and up 7% over the prior year. We're pleased with the new business risk selection and strength of pricing and overall with the combination of strong returns and customer growth in middle market. On a strategic note for middle market, we continue to enhance our industry-leading underwriting workstation with models that assess new business opportunities for risk characteristics with the propensity to produce the highest level of lifetime profitability. This information helps our field organization focus on the highest priority opportunities, resulting in a greater likelihood of success in winning more accounts that contribute to strong margins. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial and production results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Klenk - Executive Vice President, Bond & Specialty Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Greg. Bond and Specialty delivered very strong third-quarter results. We generated segment income of $250 million and an outstanding combined ratio of 81.6%, nearly one point better than the prior year quarter. The strong underlying combined ratio of 85.8% drove very attractive returns in the segment. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums in the quarter to $1.1 billion. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, renewal premium change improved to 3.7% while retention remained strong at 87%. These results reflect our intentional and segmented initiatives to improve pricing in certain lines, with a focus on employment practices liability, cyber, and public company D&O. We're pleased with the strong underlying pricing segmentation achieved by our outstanding field organization on both renewal and new business, enabled by our advanced analytics and sophisticated pricing models. New business was lower than in 2024, as Corvus production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter and is now mostly reflected as renewal premium. Comparisons to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted for the remainder of the year. Outside of the Corvus impact, we're pleased with early returns on multiple tech and operational investments we've made to drive account growth. For example, in our private and nonprofit business, we're leveraging predictive analytics and AI to enhance our customer segmentation and sales effectiveness. We're pleased that these initiatives drove a 40% increase in new lines of business sold to existing customers as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to our market-leading surety business, where production can be lumpy based on the timing of bonded construction projects, net written premiums remain strong relative to the record high quarter in the prior year. This reflects our customers' continued confidence in our industry-leading surety expertise and value-added service offerings, as well as benefits from digital investments we've made to enhance distribution experiences in our small commercial surety business. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management dilige"

So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits of our market-leading competitive advantages. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we delivered third-quarter segment income of $807 million, an excellent result that reflects the continued impact of our disciplined approach to selecting, pricing, and managing risks. The combined ratio of 81.3% improved 11 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower catastrophe losses and a lower underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 77.7% was five points better compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued improvement in both homeowners and other and auto. Net written premiums of $4.7 billion in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on improving profitability in homeowners while seeking growth in auto as we execute our strategies to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns across the portfolio. The ceded premium impact of the enhanced personal insurance excess of loss reinsurance program we announced last quarter reduced net written premium growth in the quarter by one point as the full year's worth of ceded premium was booked in the third quarter. In auto, the third-quarter combined ratio was very strong at 84.9%, reflecting lower catastrophe losses, a strong underlying combined ratio, and favorable net prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 88.3% improved by 2.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by favorable loss experience in bodily injury and, to a lesser extent, vehicle coverages. Similar to last year's third-quarter result, this quarter's underlying combined ratio included a two-point benefit related to the re-estimation of prior quarters and the current year. The year-to-date underlying combined ratio was also 88.3%, reflecting sustained profitability in an auto book that is larger than it was five years ago, both in terms of premium dollars and policy count. Looking ahead to 2025, it's important to remember that the fourth-quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been six to seven points above the average for the first three quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving. In Homeowners and Other, the third-quarter combined ratio of 78% improved by 13.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily because of lower catastrophe losses and improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Net prior year development was favorable but lower compared to the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 68% improved by almost 6.5 points compared to the prior year quarter. The year-over-year favorability in homeowners was primarily related to the benefit of earned pricing, as well as favorable non-catastrophe weather. Overall, these outstanding results reflect favorable weather conditions throughout the third quarter, along with our actions to manage exposures in high catastrophe risk geographies to help optimize risk and reward. Turning to production, we're making progress in positioning our diversified portfolio to deliver long-term profitable growth. While our production results don't quite show it yet, we're confident that the actions we're taking will build momentum toward this objective. In domestic auto, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change of 3.9% continued to moderate and will continue to decline in the fourth quarter, reflective of improved profitability and our focus on generating growth. Auto new business premium was up year over year for the fourth consecutive quarter, as new business momentum continued in states less impacted by our property actions. In Homeowners and Other, retention of 84% remained relatively consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change remained strong at 18%, as we continue to align replacement costs with insured values. We expect RPC to remain elevated in the fourth quarter and then drop into single digits beginning in early 2026 as values will have largely aligned with replacement costs. We continued to execute actions to reduce exposure and manage volatility in high-risk catastrophe geographies in the quarter, causing further declines in property new business premium and policies in force. Most of our property actions will be completed by the end of the year, at which point the downward pressure on both property and auto growth should begin to moderate. As we conclude this year and head into 2026, we're focused on building momentum toward generating profitable growth. To that end, we have a range of actions currently or soon to be in market, including the following: adjusting pricing, appetite, terms, and conditions to better reflect improved profitability in both Auto and Home; removing temporary binding restrictions and winding down some of our property new non-renewal actions in certain geographies; appointing new agents and partnering with existing agents to consolidate books of business; continuing to modernize our specialty products and platforms; and investing in artificial intelligence and digitization to deliver better experiences for our agents and customers. These messages resonate as we share them in the marketplace, reinforcing our commitment to being the undeniable choice for consumers and an indispensable partner for our agents. To sum up, we delivered terrific segment income as our team continued to invest in capabilities and deliver value to customers and agents. These results position us well to build on a long track of profitably growing our business over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abby.\n\nAbbe Goldstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Travelers):\nThanks, Michael. And with that, we're ready to open up for Q&A."

When you go beyond the balance of this year and you start thinking at 26%, 27%, what does the Travelers business model look like in terms of top line growth on a consolidated basis? And how are you thinking about them?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nHey, good morning, Greg. It's Alan. Thanks for the thoughts and the question. So we're not going to give outlook on the top line, as you can imagine. But clearly, we understand that in order to meet our objective of delivering industry-leading return on equity over time, we need to grow over time. So it's a priority for us. And if you look back over the last couple of years, we've been very successful with that. In our, you know, we, as you noted by segment, we've talked about what's driving the results this quarter. But I guess what I would say is we are very confident that we've got the right value proposition. We're investing in the right capabilities to make sure we're positioned to grow this business. So we feel very good about the execution in the quarter. We feel very good about what we've accomplished in recent periods, and we feel very good about the outlook.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. The other I seem to ask this like every other quarter on the technology front, but you keep bringing it up, talked about the digital initiative you have going on in business insurance. Talk about some of the stuff going on in personal insurance. I think one of your peers came out earlier in the third quarter and talked about the potential of artificial intelligence to deliver human resource savings and headcount reductions over time of maybe up to 20%. I'm just curious if we can just go back to, I know you've got best use case on technology and AI, but go back to how you're thinking about this in the three to five-year period in terms of what it might mean to your expense ratio?\n\nAlan Schnitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Travelers):\nYes. So Greg, I'll tell you, we are very bullish on AI, and we're leaning into it. You know, we're spending, you know, more than a billion dollars a year on technology. A lot of that is focused on AI. We expect significant benefits from it. And I think we've got a long track record, as I said in my prepared remarks, of identifying the right strategic initiatives and driving value from them. We're not going to tell you what our plan is for the expense ratio beyond next year, but I'll also tell you that more than our focus is on the expense ratio, it's on creating operating leverage. And that's what gives us the flexibility to deploy those gains however we want to deploy them. And so maybe it'll be efficiency, maybe it'll be productivity, but we are very bullish about the opportunity for investments that we have underway. We're very bullish about the data we have to fuel the AI. And think that it'll make a big difference in the years to come.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

What do you guys see in property pricing outside of national property this quarter?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes, certainly. Well, on the first one, David, it is a metric that we're not going to give every quarter, and we're not going to go back and give that. We offered it up this quarter just to give you some color and let you know how much property the leverage it had on the pricing for this particular quarter. As we've shared with you, the large property has definitely been a market where typically leads in terms of when softening may happen, and it certainly has been the case over the last couple of quarters. In the select and middle market, to directly answer your question, we continue to get positive price increases there. But it's certainly, we're feeling some deceleration. But again, certainly still seeing positive increases.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Thank you. And then maybe this is just sort of related to your answer there.

But I'm surprised we saw the deceleration in growth in middle market. I was hoping you could just impact that a little bit. Is that just sort of the property dynamics you just mentioned?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nYes. And if you're looking at overall quarter of middle market, I think you're reading that wrong. The quarter alone was up for middle market 7% relative to year to date of five.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Yeah. No, I was just looking at the because I know 1Q had the reinsurance dynamic. So I was just comparing it to 2Q, the 10 decelerating to seven. That's what I was looking at there.

Really what matters for us is in aggregate across the enterprise is that favorable or unfavorable, and we've got now a very long track record of generally having that favorable. As it relates to loss trend, we haven't explicitly commented on loss trend for a while because we think it's just too narrow a way to look at the business in terms of what's pure rate versus what's some blended number of loss trend, but it hasn't moved dramatically in recent periods. Alan's talked about that in prior quarters. We do take a look at it every quarter. Some lines do move up a little bit. Some lines do move down a little bit over time.

But if we look at the RPC trends, they remain very high on I'm assuming there's terms and conditions changes that you're incorporating in kind of those double-digit RPC increases. But the last few years haven't been great for you all in the industry. Consensus kind of has you guys pegged at a 95 combined ratio for the foreseeable future in home. If you can kind of remind us what do we expect RPC to eventually fall? Are those terms and conditions changes going to help? Is 95% the right combined ratio that you guys are targeting given how profitable auto is? Thanks.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure. Thanks, Mike. It's Michael. So just to unpack the RPC part of your question for starters, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, RPC remains elevated. Again, it's rate and exposure, right? So RPC remains elevated largely because we're raising insured limits to keep up with rising replacement costs. And my point about RPC dropping to single digits in 2026 is we'll have largely caught up in getting replacement costs in line with insured values. And so the change in RPC as we head into 2026 will really be those the premium impact from increasing coverage A, the dwelling limits on property coming back to more normal levels. Yes, baked into RPC is also a reflection of a number of the other actions we're taking on the book. I think increasing deductibles, particularly across the Midwest, think different strategies around targeted limits on how big a coverage A we're going to write in some hail-prone geographies, other things like that are all rolled into that figure. And again, I think it's just reflective of the actions that we're taking to improve the profitability of that book. As respect to target combined ratio, we're not going to really disclose the target combined ratio by line. We are certainly encouraged by the progress we've made, particularly in improving the underlying combined ratio in property. It's down period to period, quarter over quarter for something like the last ten or eleven quarters in a row. So it's demonstrative of the progress that we're making there. And again, continue to be pleased with our progress there."

Or what other tools are you using to encourage that?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Meyer. Thanks for the question. Yes. So typically, and again, book growth consolidations in the personal lines space are pretty much standard operating procedure. We had stepped away from them. The reason I mentioned it is because we had stepped away from them as we were working to improve profitability. And I think it's an important point to recognize that we're back actively engaged in the marketplace in those conversations with agents looking for situations where their book of business may be disrupted for one reason or another. It is fairly typical in a book consolidation scenario to offer enhanced commission on that book roll for the first term as that business comes over."

And a follow-up on Dan's comment about elevated level of capital liquidity. Driven by your earnings that's well in excess of your investment needed to growth. As you know, capital is a big focus for me. And I've really not seen so much excess capital for the entire sector. Is it fair to assume that your excess capital position surpasses the buyback targets you shared and could we expect concurrent deployment of capital on the technology side and or M and A.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes, Tracy, it's Dan. So I think I understand the question. So I guess I'd start by saying, look, there's no change at all to what has been now our long-standing capital management philosophy, which is we've got a business that's generating terrific margins. We generate a lot of capital. We generate more than we need just to support the growth of the business. First objective for that excess capital is going to be to find a way to deploy it and generate a return. And so we'll make all the technology investments that we think we can and should make. Always be open to M and A, open to any opportunity to generate returns on an excess capital. Once we've exhausted all those opportunities, then it's not our capital, it's the shareholders we're going to give it back through dividends and buybacks.\n\nTracey Banque - Analyst (Wolfe Research):"

And if easing those can result in a noticeable uplift in growth?\n\nGreg Toczydlowski - President, Business Insurance (Travelers):\nRobert, this is Greg. I'll start off and then Michael can talk about the PI. We've been talking about the select mix optimization for some time now. And as we begin to finalize some of those actions, you saw a slight tick up in our retention. We're not really going to quantify what that means for overall growth, but that was the reason that we pointed out the slight pickup in retention.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYeah. And Robert, Michael, up here on the personal lines side. I think the important point to note in terms of the impact on growth in personal insurance as we relax those property restrictions as our goal is to leverage that property capacity to write package business. And so if you my suggestion, if you want to sort of dimensionalize it, is just look back historically at retention in new business levels in property and in auto. You can see that retention remains depressed right now given the actions we're taking. Again, the property actions depressed retention in both lines. And you can see particularly in property the new business levels are pretty significantly depressed relative to what they've run historically. And so those levers, I think, would give you a way to kind of dimensionalize it.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay, great. Thanks for the color there. And then I just wanted to follow-up on the business insurance underlying loss ratio. When you think about the margin improvements during this year, are we seeing improved picks in casualty at all? Or is the improvement year to date largely been a shift lower in some of the shorter tail exposures?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nHey, Rob, it's Dan. Look, I think if you look at the improvement in you're talking about business insurance specifically, right?\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nYes. Is that correct?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYes. I think the single biggest factor we'd say in terms of that sort of 50 basis point improvement on a year-to-date basis has been the continued benefit of earned price. So in the casualty lines especially, and we've talked about this a couple of times, we're continuing to include some provision for a level of uncertainty in those lines that we think is going to serve us well in the long term as opposed to taking those picks down the improvement in the loss ratio. You have other things that impact every quarter too. Mix will change a little bit. But headline number the main driver of the improvement year over year has been the continued benefit of earned price.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

And just how do we think from here, you know, just given, you know, slowing pricing, which I know is mostly driven by fiber property, do we think about just the underlying loss ratio and BI? Should we think about that starting to deteriorate as rate gets closer to trend?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nYeah. Good morning, Elyse. Let's just start with where the margins are in business. I mean, they are pretty spectacular margins. And I don't think we're to parse out that level of detail. We're certainly not going to get into what the outlook for margins is. But I'll tell you at these margins, we really like the margins and we really like the business that we're putting on the books at these margins.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then I guess, you know, my second question would be, I guess, maybe shifting to personal auto. Have you guys did you guys see any impact of tariffs at all in the quarter, whether it was September relative to July and August? And how are you guys currently thinking about a potential impact of tariffs on the margins in that business?\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure Elyse, it's Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say we haven't seen a ton of impact to date from tariffs. But our results for the third quarter do include a small impact from tariffs. That said, it's well below the single-digit severity numbers that we discussed a couple of quarters ago. There certainly is the potential for that impact to grow the longer tariffs remain in effect. As you know, it's a very fluid situation. Tariff changes weekly, daily, fairly frequently. So predicting is challenging, but we are keeping a very close eye on it. To your point, there are some external industries that show some moderate increases. Others look largely unaffected. So we're going to continue to closely monitor it. But there is a little bit of a provision in the third quarter results for tariff increases, but it's not yet at the level that we had potentially forecast. And just to be clear, Michael, correct me if I'm wrong, we've got a provision in there because we expected that we might see it. We're not really seeing it in any meaningful way.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nYes. It's significant. Again, we're seeing it on the margins, and so we booked the provision for it. But again, well below the mid-single-digit level that we had described before.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

There are other states that have restrictions on proper on profitability. Just curious about how you account for that as well.\n\nMichael Klein - President, Personal Insurance (Travelers):\nSure, Paul. It's Michael. I'll start with sort of response on the overall situation. Maybe Dan can chime in on accounting. The Florida excess profit provision and the statute isn't actually a new thing. It's sort of standard operating procedure in Florida. It's actually fairly infrequent that people have to return premiums given the statute. What I would say about our business in Florida is we're pleased with our auto business in Florida. But we don't expect to need to make a return of premium to policyholders in Florida due to excess profits for the 2023 to 2025 accident year period for which we would make the filing in 2026. The other thing I would say is given the size of our business in Florida, think of our Florida auto business less than 10% of our PI auto business. Think of the Florida PI auto business 1.5% of Travelers' overall premium. I mean, it's just not going to be a significant issue for the organization even if we were to need to make a return of premium, which we don't anticipate.\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nThen Paul, it's Dan. With regard to the accounting, I guess I'm going to not give a definitive answer. And one of the reasons I won't give a definitive answer is if you go back to COVID, when we and some of our peer companies returned premium because frequency and losses declined so rapidly, so quickly, not every company accounted for that the same way. So we had a view of how that should be accounting for. That's what we reflected in our results. Other peer companies had slightly different view of how that should be accounted for. And reflected it differently in their results, by which I mean some companies took that as an expense, some companies took that as a return to premium. And as Michael said, since we've not had to deal with the Florida excess profit issue, we haven't done a real deep dive on how we think it would come through the P and L. But most importantly, I think as Michael said, we ever had it, we wouldn't expect it to be much of an impact on our consolidated results in any event.\n\nPaul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nGreat. That's super helpful. That's all I had. Appreciate it."

Is that a projected retention based on where you're pricing the business today, or have you already seen retention bottom and it's improving here?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nJosh, it's Dan. So retention is a way that we try to give you color relative to what's the change in net written premium. So a couple of things we know definitively. We know definitively at any point in time how many policies are enforced. We give you that number. We know definitively at any point in time how much premium made it into the ledger. We give you that number. Production statistics like retention, renewal premium change, new business, are all in the disclosure say. They're all subject to actuarial estimate of what do we think the ultimate retention is going to be. Because you could start on day one of a policy and look like you'd retained all of them, but we know that there's some peer period of those that are going to cancel early in the term and either go somewhere else or drop their insurance. So it's very challenging to do, I think, you're trying to do at a very specific level and go A plus B equals C. Production statistics are really color around what's happening with the top line. And I'm sorry, can't give you a more helpful answer than that.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nIf I look back at 3Q 2024, is that a more because now you have all that data.

So if you went back in true in business insurance, true in personal insurance, if you looked at historical quarters, you could almost do a triangle of what was retention as originally reported because it's an estimate. We true those up as time goes on.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd can you confidently say, and I'll leave it at this, that retention has improved from where it was a year ago, or it's still not certain?\n\nDan Frey - Chief Financial Officer (Travelers):\nI think we're pretty confident in saying that retention has improved from where it was a year ago.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

So we do think that that's our most sophisticated product in auto that we brought into the marketplace. So that helps us from a segmentation point of view.

But it's a very different ballgame for us than marketing spend other places. Our direct-to-consumer business is less than 10% of our overall business. So we are on the margin increasing marketing spend there to drive more growth.

It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our March 31, 2023 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplements. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. We had an excellent start to the year, highlighted by double-digit operating earnings growth that led to record results. We had double-digit premium revenue growth that was global, broad-based and driven by strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses and our International Life business. World-class underwriting results with an 86.3% combined ratio, record net investment income and life income that more than doubled. North America P&C rate and price increases reaccelerated in the quarter, it was an word standout performance that I expect will continue. We grew operating income almost 12% to $1.8 billion, and that drove a 15% increase to $4.41 per share, both records. In context, of what was an active CAT quarter, our published combined ratio reflects simply outstanding underwriting performance from our P&C businesses. The 83.4% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio was a record. On the Investment income side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up over 30%. Our portfolio yield is now 3.8% versus 3% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.5%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates. Life Insurance premium revenue more than doubled, while Life earnings doubled to $244 million, driven by our business in Asia and predominantly the addition of the Cigna operations which are mostly A&H and product makeup. In this time of economic and financial market volatility and uncertainty, Chubb is a safe haven. Our business model and the fundamentals of our business are very strong and broad-based. Our earnings and revenue are growing. We have an exceptionally strong capital position and a conservative level of leverage and our operating cash flow of $11 billion in '22 and over $2.25 billion this quarter speaks to our strong liquidity. Our unrealized loss as a percentage of tangible equity is 17% and will amortize back to par over a short period. Rising interest rates of our brand and most important, as you know, you can have a run on the bank in our business. So again, this speaks to an attractive profile that distinguishes Chubb. Peter is going to have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and a rising ROE. Now turning to growth and the pricing and rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 16.5% in the quarter on a published basis or over 18% in constant dollars, comprised of 11% growth in our P&C business globally and 129% growth in life premiums. P&C premium growth in the quarter was balanced and broad-based. North America, Europe and Asia, all produced double-digit growth. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums were up almost 12% or 6.2% excluding Agriculture. Adjusted for the impact of one-off loss portfolio transfers in our major accounts division, year-over-year North America regular commercial flow grew 7.6%, which is representative of the minimum rate growth we expect for the balance of the year. And by the way, the 7.6% is broken down as 10% growth in P&C and minus 2% growth in financial lines. Our major accounts and specialty division grew 6.3% or 8.7% adjusted for the LPTs. And that was 11.4% P&C and minus 7% financial lines. In our middle market and small commercial business, premiums were up 6.5% or 7% in P&C and up 2% in financial lines. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was 97%. On the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business was up almost 10%, an exceptionally strong result. And in fact, the strongest organic growth in over 15 years. Turning to our International General Insurance operations, net premiums were up 10% in constant dollars or 6% after FX impact with commercial up 10.8% and consumer up over 8.5%. Growth was led by our Asia Pacific region with premiums up over 18.5%. And with commercial lines up about 15% and consumer lines up over 22%. And Europe produced overall growth of over 10%. In terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, rate and price increases reaccelerated. Pricing for total North America Commercial P&C, which includes rate of 6.4% and exposure change of 4.5% increased 11.2% against a loss cost trend of 6.7%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty, excluding financial lines and workers' comp was up 16.9%. Property pricing was up 27%, with rates up 16.4% and exposure change of 9.1%. Casualty pricing was up 9.9%, which includes 7.4% of rate and 2.3% of exposure. As I said last quarter, for professional lines and workers' comp, which includes risk management, the competitive environment is aggressive and rates have continued to decline in recognition of favorable experience. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America, financial lines and aggregate were down about 2% and in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and risk management, pricing was up 6.4%, with rates down 0.5% and exposure up about 6.8%. Internationally, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, pricing was up about 8%, with rates up 4.8%, and exposure change of about 2.9%. While loss costs across our international commercial portfolio, or trending at 6.5%. Turning to our Consumer businesses. In North America, high net worth personal lines business, again, net written premiums were up almost 10%. With our true high net worth client segment, up over 15%. Retentions were 104% on a premium basis and about 91% or on an account basis. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capacity. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 13%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. International consumer lines premiums again grew over 8.5% in the quarter in constant dollars. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter, with premiums up about 20%. Asia Pacific was up 34.5% while the U.K. was up over 12%. Premiums in our international personal lines business were down 1.5 points, and it was impacted by our business in Europe. In our International Life Insurance business, again, premiums and income overall more than doubled. Our business in Korea and the majority of Asia is off to a good start to the year. I was just i"

Our business in Korea and the majority of Asia is off to a good start to the year. I was just in Korea two weeks ago, our leadership, the franchise, the strategy, the execution and the growth are all in really good shape. And this is a very large business for Chubb. In summary, we had an excellent quarter and have had a strong start to the year with a lot of momentum heading into the second quarter. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings, which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C underwriting income, investment income and life income. Add to that our business model, financial strength, stability and liquidity, and I believe you have in Chubb, both the reassurance of safety, and the attractive prospects of a long-term growth company. I'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, Evan, and good morning. Before we begin, I want to note that previously reported numbers in the financial supplement we just filed were adjusted to reflect the impact from the adoption of LDTI accounting, which primarily relates to our Life Insurance business. The cumulative impact of LDTI on our book value and overall results is immaterial. Please refer to Page 31 of the financial supplement for detailed information. Turning to our first quarter results. As you've just heard, we are starting out the year an exceptionally strong financial position. Our P&C divisions, expanding life business and strong investment performance produced operating cash flow of $2.3 billion. We grew our assets to over $200 billion, and this includes invested assets of about $116 billion that continued to benefit from the current rate environment and generated our fourth consecutive quarter of record net investment income. I would note S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed our AA ratings and stable outlook, reflecting our strong financial position. Relative to capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $772 million to shareholders, including $428 million in share repurchases at an average price of $212.81 per share and $344 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share increased 5% and 8.7%, respectively, from last quarter. The increase reflects our record core operating income and net realized and unrealized gains of $1.7 billion in the investment portfolio, partially offset by the capital return to shareholders I already mentioned. Our core operating ROE for the quarter was 12.6%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 19.4%. A year ago, Evan stated our target for 2023 core operating ROE, excluding excess capital or on a deployed capital basis to be 13% and core operating return on tangible equity to be 20%. In this first quarter of 2023, we estimate the deployed capital ROE results to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% and 23% to 23.5%, respectively. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $1.2 billion and topped last year's record quarter -- last quarter's record by over 7%, reflecting higher reinvestment rates that impact recurring income as well as certain items totaling approximately $35 million, including higher-than-expected private equity distributions that vary from quarter-to-quarter. We now expect our adjusted net investment income on a recurring basis to rise from this quarter's 1.165 to 1.2 to 1.22 next quarter and we expect it to continue to rise from there for the remainder of the year given our positive cash flows, portfolio turnover and the current reinvestment rate environment. Let me make a few more comments on investments given recent economic and market events. We continue to maintain our consistent conservative approach to our investment process and our portfolio remains high quality with an average rate A rating. Our overall exposure to banks is 8% of invested assets with two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of that in G-SIFIs. We have no exposure to Silicon Valley Signature or First Republic Banks. We have no exposure to Credit Suisse contingent capital securities and do not invest in Tier 1 bank Cocos as an investment policy. Our exposure to regional banks is less than 1% of our portfolio and is in high-quality names. Our total direct exposure to commercial real estate is 4% of invested assets and 87% of that total is in investment-grade securities with an average rating of AA. This portfolio is skewed to multifamily and industrial sectors with under 20% related to the commercial office segment. High-yield credit is currently 14% of our portfolio and is targeted to the upper tier of the high-yield market, rated BB with a current average rating of B+ broadly diversified with over 900 issuers and mandated to outperform in down markets. Back to our underwriting business. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $458 million split 76% in the U.S. and 24% internationally. In the U.S., the loss activity consisted of winter-related storms and other severe weather events. Internationally, results were primarily impacted by storms in New Zealand and Australia. Prior period development in the quarter was a favorable $196 million. Included in that total is adverse development of $6 million related to the 2022 accident year cat losses comprised of $119 million adverse development from Winter storm Elliott, and $113 million favorable from Hurricane Ian. Excluding cat-related development, we had favorable development of $202 million across all lines, commercial and consumer, with $228 million favorable related to short tail lines and an adverse development of $26 million in long tail lines, $10 million of which was from corporate runoff lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 92% or 82% after adjusting for cats prior period development and a large payment related to the Boy Scouts of America settlement. Our core operating effective tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter at the low end of our expected annual range. I would highlight the first quarter often has a lower tax rate than the full year, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for this year to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Lastly, relative to Wati, we closed on some of our outstanding shares during the quarter, which brought our ownership interest to 64%. We continue to apply equity accounting for the first quarter, and we'll consolidate Wati once we go over two-thirds ownership, which we think will likely occur in the second quarter when we anticipate exceeding 80%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions."

Your line is open.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGood morning, Evan. So really encouraging to see the reacceleration in North America commercial pricing. It sounds like most of that was rate versus exposure. I guess I also heard that you said you expect a 7.6% sort of minimum growth in North America commercial throughout the course of the year. So wondering if you could just unpack how you see that progressing between both rate on existing policies as well as just growth in terms of adding new incremental units of exposure?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. No. David, as you know, we don't give forward guidance really. And I gave you a little flash, but I'm not going to go further than that. I was pretty clear, I expect the trend you see in pricing, and I expect the trend you see in sort of pattern and growth to continue. And you got a sense of P&C lines growing and you got a sense of professional or financial lines. And beyond that, it's not simply about North America and look at the company globally, and frankly, look at the International P&C and I expect the pattern to continue, look at consumer lines, and I expect the pattern to continue. Look at life, and I expect the pattern to continue. Investment income, and I expect the pattern to continue.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nOkay. Great. I appreciate that. And then as my follow-up, Evan, in your letter, you spoke about how Chubb enhanced its ability to collect and assess loss cost at more quickly and accurately and then that helps you be more insightful in pricing and reserving. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how you enhance the stability. And if that played in, I heard you may have ticked up the loss trend a little bit in North America commercial. Wondering what insight gave you to do or this enhanced ability to view loss trend data, how that played into potentially changing? How you're viewing trend going forward?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. And I talked about this, you're right in the letter and on previous calls, and that is like so many businesses. If you take a bigger picture view of it, insurance and among other financial companies and nonfinancial, we're coming out of a -- and have come out of a period of very low inflation. Zero cost of money fundamentally are overwhelmed by liquidity. And in the low inflation environment, you don't have to be necessarily as insightful on loss cost any -- at a particular moment in time, lag has less of an impact on you. You have to watch it very carefully, and we always -- but the time element of date of when of data when you get it, you could be a little more relaxed. It's a quarter old -- two quarters old, less important. In an inflationary environment, which we experienced and began while ago, that's a killer. And for those of us who've experienced inflation at time values can mean everything in accuracy. And that's where we really immediately when we saw it jumped on it and measured that time lag in data, which you have to get to the source of input when you're looking at inflation, whether it's on the physical side of when a repair is actually occurring to an automobile or a home or it's on the liability side very quickly in the development of that. You have to be on top of the trend and you really have to unpack severity from frequency and then you had the impact of COVID on frequency. So -- and then you add to that the tools we have available terms of external data and the use of it and our ability to manipulate and use data internal and external more insightfully and more quickly. You add the capabilities and analytics of this organization with claims and actuarial and underwriting together, and I think it's a competitive weapon and advantage particularly the speed at which we can react. And I think any modern financial organization that distinguishes itself. That's part of the action.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

Any -- given industries experiencing higher reinsurance costs, both on property and on the casualty side and maybe that's not the case for Chubb. Feel free to correct me. Is Chubb contemplating any changes in its strategy, maybe retentions? Or is this still TBD as things progress?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, no material change. And we obviously aren't going to -- as you can appreciate, I'm not going to discuss our own reinsurance program. That's for our own protections, that's proprietary. But our retentions have not changed in any material way. And we've got a big balance sheet. We take a lot of risk net. And we really don't buy reinsurance for earnings protection so much. We buy it for -- more for balance sheet protection. And depending on the line of business volatility and that's been a steady policy of ours and we maintain it regardless of cycle.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. Follow up on market conditions. You gave us a lot of good color. If we -- the acceleration in pure rate accelerated a lot more than I think there might have been a tad bit of a loss cost pickup just on the North America commercial side. But maybe you can kind of lend some more color on, do you feel the markets being more rational in terms of kind of adjusting to loss cost trends and also higher reinsurance pricing? And it sounded like you were optimistic that things have -- competitive conditions have gotten a little bit better quarter-over-quarter. Thanks.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Property, certainly and short tail certainly responding. I think in larger account business, responding a little better than in middle market, though middle market has a stability to it. It's more in P&C lines. I think that financial lines, certain areas of financial lines, it's -- and so in those areas, I generally like the tone. We're seeing excess casualty, particularly in larger comp business respond. I'm imagining in time, middle market will need to and will. So rate is pretty -- our rates are increasing there. When I look at professional lines, and you have to unpack it between financial lines between professional liability and there are all kinds of classes in D&O, both private and public D&O. I think public D&O market, there are a lot of players with no data and no experience and they're receiving many of them capacity by those who don't seem to have their eye on the ball. And there's an area where I think the market is overshooting the mark and of course we'll always trade in that case, volume for and under the right underwriting. And it's not an area that I think is devoid of risk, particularly as you look forward, everything from recession and volatility in financial markets to climate change and claims of greenwashing and all of that. So it doesn't that -- and that's just a line on the margin. So it's a mixed bag. Comp is overall experience is good. Exposure is growing. And on the other hand, you got to be careful on exposure because wages are rising. That means indemnity, severity, prize and I've said it before, I point the market could shoot the market comps. So you got to be a little cautious. But overall, in direction, you see the direction in P&C lines. And I think that direction is a tone that will continue and a pattern that I expect will continue.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

And so that's overall. And then -- and so I'm happy to answer overall. And by the way, I said to you 10% growth in P&C lines. And I said financial lines, professional lines, financial lines in aggregate down. So I think in areas where we like the pricing, you're seeing the business grow And I'll leave it at that. I'm not going to go deeper than that. I think I gave -- I just gave what investors need to know.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. And then my other question was on the G&A expense side. Seem to be a modest pickup in North America, both personal and commercial. Are there any specific platform investments you can call out? Or is it just wage inflation hiring?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. The expense ratio, you'll know -- was up because pension expenses -- fundamentally is pension expenses with the rise in interest rates that picked up. And that's just -- that's something that you can't control really. It's just -- it's an accounting adjustment for future pension costs on. We have a defined benefit pension plan that's closed for many years, it was legacy Chubb that had that and so that's the impact. That's all.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. So is that a reasonable run rate to think of for the rest of the year?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, reasonable. You'll note the pattern of expense ratio. It's usually a little higher this quarter than in future quarters when I look at it.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think the pension will be consistent each quarter.

You talked about the Life results. Maybe you can give us an update on the Cigna acquisition, how the integration is proceeding and if there's any update on sort of ROE targets related to Cigna now that it's in the Chubb family?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I'll just take the last part first. As you know, the egg is scrambled now. And so we don't really spike that part out. But look, I'm -- I am energized by what I see in Asia and what we have bubbling. And by the way, I'm going to do third quarter earnings from Asia. I'm going to do it from Singapore because I'm going to spend six or seven weeks out there. The integration is going so well. And we're so energized by what we see in the power of the organization with the two parts pulled together. The integration has gone extremely well. And of course, all the efficiencies, that's the easy part in a sense, that's all right on target. But it's the -- growth and the breadth of capability, our direct marketing business. We're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia. There's not a doubt to me, both through telemarketing, through digital, life and non-life, the breadth of product there. The number of partnerships that we have between the organizations and the compelling offering, given the breadth and the ability of our life and nonlife together, work together like one organization. No one else really has that. The customer database we have between the companies that numbers in the millions of customers to cross-market and cross-sell to that we're just actively doing through telemarketing and digital. The growth of our agency organization, whether it's in Korea through independent life agency distribution or in places like Thailand and Vietnam with tens of thousands of agents that are growing. When I look across Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, even Hong Kong, that's small, but the combination of the two and growth is accelerating in these areas, the number of partnerships that we have. So when I add it all together, I feel really good about what we have as franchise and capability and the potential of it over time. And by the way, a lot of the same features I see in Latin America, a much smaller region just the geography and the size of economies. But wow, it's excellent. And then by the way, I'm sure you noticed that in the quarter, Europe grew 10%. That's 40% of their business renews in the year and they do in the year, and they grew at 10%. So it's really broad-based, and I like what I see.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nYes, the Europe numbers are kind of surprising against the backdrop of the macros news that we read about here and there. I spent some time during the discussion talking about all the data resources, the analytics you have. And one of the topics that's become more popular and more recent is this ChatGPT. So maybe you can segue and talk about how you're deploying AI across your organization and the opportunity you have to drive further efficiencies as you utilize these types of tools?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I'll touch on it a little bit. ChatGPT is generalized AI, which is text-based analytics and deep thinking. We use other kinds of AI, deep learning, and others beyond that, that are numbers-based, math-based as well. We've been experimenting in the use of various forms of AI is the point against different areas of our business, depending on the kind of opportunity or problem or enhancement of power that we're trying to address from underwriting and insight in risk cohorts to claims to -- cut to marketing and analytics for customer interface and customer service or telemarketing. And we've been doing this for the last five years. We have a variety of use cases that have proven themselves out. And we continue to iterate with it. We have a lot of data, and we have an ability to enhance that data with external data. It's not simply about AI tools. It's about data and your ability with that. So therefore, you keep pulling a string in your data infrastructure becomes so important. And data engineering becomes so important because it's a fuel that AI needs to feed on itself in all its varieties to become insightful and powerful to you. And in most cases, it's not going to replace our highest skilled knowledge workers. We won't do that for quite a while. But it certainly enhances the abilities and the capability. I'm not worried about my job. It certainly enhances their capabilities. And now we're in the dawn of the period where we use these tools at scale. And the things that we have built and experimented with, the momentum builds and they start rolling out at scale. And that means insight. That means speed, that means accuracy, that means cost, that means momentum. And think of that in terms of a number of years, it's not months.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):"

It sounds like on the primary property side than perhaps to write more property reinsurance business, but I was hoping you could just expand on that comment and correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. No, you're correct. We're -- we got a finite balance sheet. We can't take infinite amount of risk. And we like the risk reward and the total opportunity. On the primary side, we're much more biased on the primary side than we are on the cat REIT side. And so that is correct. So our cat REIT and CAD and property excess and property quota share business. So not just straight cat REIT. Those are areas where we're taking more exposure. But -- you're right, overwhelmingly, when we look at the market and the risk reward, we're more primary oriented.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my second question, Peter, I know you said that you guys will consolidate the Wati ownership when it goes above 80%.

Or can you just give us a sense of the expected contribution on once that is consolidated or any help you can provide there?\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. We typically don't -- we have not disclosed Huatai's earnings specifically. We'll have more comments after it closes and we consolidate it. And what I've said historically is it won't have a material impact on a net basis to us in terms of earnings.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWhat we say -- is it will be pretty neutral initially.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

The second question, I'm just curious, I'm trying to kind of do some mental math here on this, and that can be dangerous, but looking at your 11% and change pricing in North America commercial versus the 7.6% premium growth, was there something going on with mix or something would cause pricing to be greater than the premium growth?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThere's always something going on with max.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nSo is it a mix issue or something going on?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nAnd remember, I gave you, I gave you P&C growth versus financial lines growth. And I didn't give you any more than -- I'm not going to go deeper than that. And then I gave you rate and trend and you have renewal retention rate, I gave you that. New business varied by area. So the -- is there anything more to it really? Not really. Now in property, and I should say this to you, as you ask it. In property where you see the rate, rate includes -- because we can measure it so accurately. The change in terms and conditions, so of deductible changes, that's worth rate. And so you could exceed this exposure actually go down there. And if you're following me. Done so, that also when you want to roll around math in your brain that may help you a little bit.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nThat's really, really helpful. And then can I just one follow-up. Cyber market. Can you just tell us kind of what your thoughts are there now in the cyber market. Is that an attractive market at this point from a pricing and what's happened with term condition in the last couple of years?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. The terms and conditions, there's a lot of noise in particular, it's around cat exposure and war and definitions of war or I think war is a misnomer. It's hostile actions by nation states. And that would be more of the term and conditions of what's going on. But beyond that, the cyber loss environment is not benign. Ransomware frequency of loss and severity is picking up, it was temporarily down. Cyber pricing and underwriting has responded to the external environment, I think, reasonably well. And if it maintains discipline, then I'm not concerned. But I would assume that all cyber underwriters see what we see in terms of the loss environment, and you're going to be aware of it. But other than that, it's -- I think, reasonably disciplined in underwriting and pricing.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):"

I'm just curious, like over the past, call it, five years or so, if you could -- just kind of walk us through how your thought process has evolved? We appreciate that business a little bit more. I guess it comes from a place where the Cigna deal, it felt like a nice little financial acquisition, but I didn't think it was going to put you in Singapore for seven weeks. So you're clearly more enthusiastic about this business. So yes, how has your thinking evolved to really think that's a growth hedging for Chubb?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. First, I want to take a step back on that and say, Asia is on my mind. It's not simply the life business. Half of the business is P&C, that is robust. Asia itself, I don't hold me in the number. I have it in my head, but it's roughly a $10 billion region for us. Important, it's massive, region and scale. It's the greatest -- it has the greatest growth potential economically. I think, of any region in the world over the next decade, two decades. So it has a volatility to it, naturally. India, China, Southeast Asia, the dynamism of developed Asia, Korea, Japan. It's just -- it's massive. Australia is part of Asia to us, back to the Australians. And it's non-life and life. And I look at it as one organization, it's Chubb. The way they work together is awesome. We began our life business about a decade -- I began it over a decade ago. I mean, heck, I was pounding on the door of Vietnam to get one of the few life licenses they gave out in 2002. 2003, I was banging on that door. And we've been at it since growing organically and then through acquisition and the Cigna just turbocharged it. At the same time in our non-life business. We are growing from dust and A&H business that could have been incubated in a life company or a nonlife company. Cigna's to a large degree A&H business. Our Life business is a combination of agency distribution on direct marketing and the direct marketing is non-life and life. And the life products themselves are much more back to the future. It's because Asia is different and their traditional life products that have much better ROE characteristics to them. They have very low guarantees. They have traditional savings. They have a lot of risk element to them that we like, A&H, in particular, whether it's dread disease or hospital cash. Very limited basic medical. The customer buys along with savings and savings rates are high in Asia. You have a very young population. The youngest in the world and a growing labor force. And it's combined with a very family-oriented culture and ethic and that drives long-term savings. And you have low social safety net. And so private insurance means more. That all plays to life and to non-life. And frankly, operating my office from there and I'm going to be out of both Hong Kong and Singapore is simply there is such opportunity, and I travel back and forth have for decades a few times a year, but this is just to be more insightful and deeper about it in terms of strategy as we go forward. And my colleagues, many of them will do the same -- global company.\n\nRyan Tunis - Equity Research Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nThank you. And just quickly, I guess this is more nuance might be for Peter. But you mentioned some LPT activity in North America commercial. Just curious if that had any impact on the loss ratio year-over-year?\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nVery -- it was minor in terms of its impact that the loss ratio down expense ratio up. That's what happens with it. But very, very minor. You can measure it at 10%.\n\nRyan Tunis - Equity Research Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix. Actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As I mentioned on our last call, I\u2019m coming to you this quarter from Singapore, our regional headquarters for Asia Pacific. The outlook in Asia for growth across our businesses - commercial P&C, as well as consumer, non-life and life, both short and long term is significant. The region is simply energizing. We have a large organization of talented executives and a strong, diverse capability focused on the execution of a broad set of strategies throughout the region. As you saw in our press release, we had a simply outstanding quarter; in fact, another record quarter performance with double-digit premium revenue and earnings growth as a result of world-class P&C underwriting results that produced an 85.4 combined ratio, record net investment income and a doubling of our life earnings. Our premium revenue growth was so well spread and broad-based, driven by outstanding double-digit growth in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses in both North America and internationally, and over 100% growth in our life business. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.8 with a return on tangible equity of 21%. Core operating income topped $2 billion, up 14% or 16.5% on a per-share basis. Both were record results. For the first six months, we produced operating earnings of $3.9 billion or $9.32 per share, up 13% and 15.8% respectively. Our underwriting performance resulted from a combination of strong premium growth, excellent current accident year margins with a combined ratio of 83.3, and favorable prior period reserve development particularly in North America.  On the investment side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up $290 million or 31% over prior year. Our portfolio yield is now 4% versus 3.2% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.8%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates and compound income without changing our risk profile, and then life earnings doubled to $254 million, driven by our business in Asia, which is overwhelmingly supplemental A&H. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and ROE. Now turning to more color around growth, pricing and the rate environment, consolidated net written premiums for the company increased 16.1% in the quarter on a published basis, or 16.8% in constant dollars, made up of 10.5% growth in our P&C business globally and almost 130% in life premiums.  Global P&C premium growth in the quarter was very well balanced and broad-based; in fact, our strongest quarter for growth since the third quarter of \u201921. North America, Asia-Pac and Europe all produced double-digit growth. It\u2019s worth noting since 2019, we\u2019ve grown our commercial P&C business by 50%.  In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines were strong in the quarter in both North America and internationally, while financial lines globally continued to soften. We have been diligent about staying on top of loss costs and our positive prior year reserve development reflects a steady conservative approach to reserving. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums excluding ag were up 10.5%. P&C growth was 14% excluding financial lines, while financial lines premiums decreased, reflecting the disciplined response to the underwriting environment. Total premium in our E&S business, the Westchester, grew 12%, while our major accounts division grew 14%, or 11% excluding loss portfolio transfers.  In our middle market division, premiums were up 5% with P&C growth of 9%. Our middle market workers comp book was flat and financial lines premiums in middle market declined about 1.5%.  Overall pricing for total North America commercial lines increased 12.8%, including rate of 8.7% and exposure change of 3.8%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty excluding financial lines was up 17.7%.  We are trending loss cost in North America at 6.7 and it varies by line. In general, we are trending loss cost in short tail classes at 5.8. In long tail, excluding comp loss costs are trending at 7.3 and our first dollar workers comp book is trending at 4.7. Let me provide a bit more color around rate and growth. Property pricing was up 31.5% with rates up 22% and exposure change of 7.8%. Major accounts and E&S property together grew premiums over 40% in the quarter, while middle market property grew 11.4%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.3% with rates up almost 9% and exposure up 2.2%. We grew casualty in the quarter 8%. In workers comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up just over 5% with rates up 5% and exposure up 4%. Primary workers comp premiums declined 2.9% in the quarter.  For financial lines, the competitive environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O, and rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North American financial lines in aggregate were down about 4.5%. Our fin lines book shrank 3.7%. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was very strong at 98.5%. On the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another strong quarter with premiums up almost 11%. Our growth was balanced across a broad range of geographies and our retention was very strong at 104% on a premium basis and over 90% on an account basis. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 14.7% while the homeowners loss cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. There is a lot of attention placed on consumer auto experience, so I thought I would comment briefly on it. For us, auto is a small part of our high net worth business, and you may have noticed that we had a modest reserve release in our prior year\u2019s reserves for our North America personal lines segment in the quarter. This release was primarily in auto, and we are comfortable with our reserves and loss PICs for auto. Turning to our international general insurance operations, net premiums were up 11% in constant dollars, or 9.3% after FX. Our international"

Our international retail business grew over 10.5% while our London wholesale business grew about 14%.  In our international retail business, growth was led by Asia Pacific with premiums up 17.5%, made up of commercial lines growth of over 12% and consumer P&C up more than 23%. Europe produced overall growth of 10.5% with the continent up more than 12%. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across international commercial portfolios. Our retail business pricing was up 8.9% with rates up 5% and exposure change of 3.7%, while loss costs across our international commercial portfolio are trending at 6.6%. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter with premiums up over 16%. In Asia, our A&H business grew 31% driven by our direct marketing and travel insurance business and the consolidation of Cigna Thailand. In the U.K. and Europe, A&H premiums were up 11.5%. In our international life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums tripled to over a billion dollars. Since I\u2019m here, I want to conclude with a bit more about operations in Asia, which have very strong growth and momentum across our businesses, both consumer non-life and life, and commercial P&C. We have significant opportunity for growth, both short and long term, in a broad variety of markets across a broad range of customers and distribution channels. Our total premium in the region is about $9 billion and well balanced with half non-life split 50/50 consumer and commercial, and the other half life.  Our overall presence and capabilities in north, Southeast Asia and Australia are spread across 11 markets with distinct and significant areas of growth opportunity in each. Across the region, we have a broad range of product capabilities focused on different customer segments with varied and meaningful distribution strength, including the diverse and growing list of partnerships with financial institutions and e-commerce leaders that give us access to hundreds of millions of consumers.  We have strong digital capabilities and a fast-growing digital insurance business encompassing more of our products. We are the largest direct marketers of insurance, mostly A&H products to consumers in Asia through both non-life and life companies that are unifying to offer more products to more customers. From a macro perspective, the region is so dynamic and vast with a diversity of cultures and large economies, some with large young populations, some with large aging populations that have a different set of needs. Broadly speaking in Asia, there is an innovation-oriented mindset, a strong work ethic and a deep dynamism. Supply chains and capital flows are growing deeper across the region. There is growing infrastructure investment. As a result, regional commerce and trade is growing and becoming more connected between Southeast Asia, North Asia, India and Australia. There is a lot to be optimistic about. Summary - we are having an outstanding year with record quarterly and first half financial results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way and underwriting conditions are favorable in a lot of areas of our business. We have a lot of momentum heading into the second half, and as I look ahead, we again are confident in our ability to continue this pattern of growth in revenue and earnings and in turn drive double-digit EPS growth.  I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Peter and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThank you Evan, and good morning. As you\u2019ve just heard, Chubb delivered another quarter of strong underwriting and investment performance, leading to record results which generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow this quarter and $4.8 billion through the first half of the year. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $724 million in share repurchases at an average price of $197.04 per share, and $354 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.2% and 3.1% respectively for the quarter and 4.3% and 6.5% respectively through the first half of the year, reflecting record core operating income net of the capital returned to shareholders noted earlier. In addition to the quarterly ROEs Evan just gave you, our year-to-date core operating ROE and return on tangible equity of 3.2% and 20.2% respectively exceed the target range Evan has laid out in the past.  Adjusted net investment income from the quarter was $1.24 billion or $20 million above the top end of our guidance, primarily from higher private equity income. The increase over last year of 30% was driven by strong cash flow, our accelerated portfolio turnover, and higher reinvestment rates. In the third quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to rise from $1.24 billion this quarter to around $1.27 billion on a recurring basis, and to continue to grow from there. Relative to our invested assets, we continue to tactically execute our portfolio turnover strategy while maintaining a conservative credit posture. During the quarter, we reclassified our $8 billion held-to-maturity portfolio to available for sale, to have even more flexibility to put money to work at higher yields. These securities had $397 million after tax of net unrealized losses that reduced book value at the time of the change. It\u2019s important to note that the transfer itself has no economic impact as the underlying securities remained unchanged and are of a very high quality, with an average rating of AA. We will look to sell parts of this portfolio only where and when we think it makes economic sense, and not all of the unrealized loss will become realized. Turning to our underwriting business, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $400 million principally from weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $260 million pre-tax, which was split about evenly between short tail and long tail lines and included $146 million for North American commercial and $61 million for overseas general. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $60 million principally related to molestation claim development. As I noted, the PPD and overseas general for the quarter was $61 million versus $173 million last year. The larger favorable PPD in the quarter last year was concentrated in the 2020 accident year and included favorable development from COVID-related economic shutdowns. The year-to-date favorable PPD for overseas general was $204 million, comparable to last year\u2019s $233 million and $181 million in 2021, all in short tail lines for these years. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter was 89% or 83% after adjusting for cats and PPD.  Turning to our life segment, year-over-year segment income growth came primarily from the acquisition of Cigna.  Our core operating effective income tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is at the top end of our guided range of 18% to 19%. We now expect our annual operating effective tax rate for 2023 to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%, excluding the impact of consolidating Huatai. On July 1, we completed the acquisition of additional shares of Huatai Group, increasing our aggregate ownership to 69.6%. We expect the closing of additional shares this quarter, which will bring our ownership up to 83.2%.  Beginning in Q3, we will consolidate Huatai\u2019s results within our financials. We currently estimate consolidation will result in a small amount of accretion to operating income and EPS, book value and ROE, and a modest amount of dilution to tangible book value which we estimate will recover within the next few quar"

Good morning.  I guess first question would be on the--thanks for the commentary on loss trend in the commercial side. It sounded like it stayed flattish and yet the rate environment accelerated sequentially. I\u2019m just curious, any context on why the rate environment is accelerating if loss costs are kind of staying steady - I know that\u2019s just for you, and does your loss cost, also PIC include higher reinsurance costs, if you\u2019re experiencing higher reinsurance costs? Thanks.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell you know, the rate, it\u2019s all baked into it, of course; but the rate environment accelerated in property, and I think that speaks for itself, as you know, where it\u2019s about the loss environment particularly around cat and inflation costs and property generally, and reinsurance costs have moved up in property, and I think that\u2019s a--you know, in total that\u2019s a very rational response. In casualty, loss cost trends have been moving higher and I think it\u2019s reflective of the trend we\u2019ve been observing over the last number of years. It\u2019s not a new story, it\u2019s a story we\u2019re aware of and on top of, but I think it\u2019s rational. You know, you see comp and professional lines, I talked about going the other way, so I think the market frankly and the reacceleration is a rational response to the external environment.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. My one follow-up is on--you touched on catastrophe losses. They actually looked a bit lighter than at least what the consensus models for kind of a normal 2Q for Chubb, whereas some other competitors, maybe more regional based, have experienced much, much higher than, quote-unquote, normal catastrophe levels. Any commentary on your cat load this quarter, was it just--was it kind of in line with expectations?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou know, cat losses are never in line with--particularly with expectations. They\u2019re either greater or less than you might imagine in any quarter on the average annual loss PIC you would choose for that. This was a very heavy cat quarter for the industry, and I think most companies have reported significantly higher cat losses than average. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any particular magic as to why Chubb\u2019s was lower. We underwrite well, we have a good spread of business, we select risk well; but that doesn\u2019t mean we choose where a--it translates to we choose where a tornado is going to land and come down. If it had moved 10 miles to the east or west, we could have had greater losses. It\u2019s a variation. It has variability quarter on quarter, and we had a very good experience this quarter. Thanks for the question."

I guess my first question, just looking at North America, commercial\u2019s underlying loss ratio, the improvement there, is there a mix component there? Is it mostly rate over trend? Could you maybe elaborate on that a bit?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThe current accident year loss ratio, it reflects the totality of the commercial business, so it\u2019s a mix of all the lines, right? Property and casualty rate and price exceed loss cost, and that is potentially a positive to the ultimate loss ratio margin. In the case of comp and financial lines, rate and price lag the selected trends, and in that case the ultimate margin is potentially shrinking or it\u2019s neutral. Our loss PIC reflects all of that, and we\u2019re patient and we lean towards conservatism in our loss PICs. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. Then my second question, just with regards to rate adequacy particularly in financial lines and property, just because of the very different directions we\u2019re seeing rates moving in those lines, are the rates adequate in both of those today?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think for the business we\u2019ve written, yes, the rates are adequate for our portfolio, and our loss PICs reflect that.

It is - it\u2019s about 8:30. \n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nIt\u2019s almost bedtime, right?  For my first question, in your prepared comments, you spoke about innovation and specifically in Asia, and there\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace--you know, it\u2019s been ongoing, but it seems to have accelerated this year around artificial intelligence, large language models, generative AI, and we obviously closely monitor your expense ratio, so maybe you could spend a minute and talk about your perspectives on these very important technology developments and how you think about it for your company, not only in North America but on a global basis.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, and thanks for that question. We\u2019ve been employing AI for quite a number of years now - five or six years, anyway, and particularly it\u2019s algorithmic AI, not generalized or large language models. It\u2019s employed in the operations side of the business, to a degree in the underwriting and claims side and the marketing side, chatbots, etc. There have been a lot of experiments and use cases that prove themselves out, and we\u2019re now in a stage where we\u2019re scaling and will over the next two or three years to receive what we think are significant benefits out of that, insightfulness and abilities in underwriting and in claims in discrete areas in the service side of our business where we see cost and lower level work that can come out or improve in its accuracy. All of that is things we know and we\u2019re scaling the tools. At the same time, as you can imagine, we are on the large language models and the potential benefit that that will ultimately bring beyond algorithmic, particularly in underwriting and claims and the ability to work--either replace work that is done or make it more accurate, or work alongside underwriters. It\u2019s not a silver bullet, and we\u2019re doing this on a global basis, some regions more in marketing, some more focused on portfolio underwriting. But yet, whatever anyone is doing spreads to the other, and it\u2019s just where we start on one and end with another. The generalized and large language is going to be iterative, it will be over time. If you think about insurance and the parameterization risk or factor around what we do, how many lines of business, the exposures, the geographies you cross, and so by its nature it\u2019s going to be iterative and take longer than some of the breathless rhetoric that I hear, but we\u2019re focused on that as part of what a modern insurance company is going to look like and is looking like.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nI feel like we could probably have a long conversation on that topic. Appreciate the comments. I need to pivot as my follow-up question to the reinsurance business--\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nCome and see me sometime, we\u2019ll talk about it.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay, let me know when you\u2019re available. \n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nTomorrow for breakfast, if you want to show up! Go ahead.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nI don\u2019t know if I can make it there tomorrow. Reinsurance - you know, you look at what\u2019s going on in the market, and I know you\u2019re very close to it, it seems like especially in property cat, it seems like these conditions, some of the hardest market conditions we\u2019ve experienced in 20-plus years, and yet if I look at your global reinsurance business and look at the growth, it seems like you\u2019re not really growing your exposures, you\u2019re just growing your rate. Maybe you could provide some perspective on how you\u2019re looking at the reinsurance business in the context--and maybe your perspective is the rate\u2019s still inadequate, but give your perspectives on the reinsurance market. That\u2019d be helpful.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, look - I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said, but you\u2019ll notice at the same time, our property insurance business is growing, like, 40% right now, and that\u2019s a combination of rate and exposure, and some of that exposure is not premium, by the way, it\u2019s structural changes and it\u2019s unit count. It\u2019s a lot of exposure growing.  In property cat, that\u2019s growing more exposure as we grow that, and it\u2019s growing it in the tail. When we look at the risk-reward--and by the way, the property insurance as we grow it across geographies is also growing exposure in the tail. We prefer to put our emphasis on the property insurance business, and the spread of risk we\u2019re getting, we\u2019ve never seen better pricing and better risk-adjusted returns than we see right now in large account, E&S, middle market, in a variety of geographies across the globe. We\u2019re putting more emphasis on that than we are on property cat. We don\u2019t think the risk-adjusted returns are as favorable - plain and simple.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

Just wanted to ask, I guess sort of related to the last question, just about premium growth in North America commercial and the difference between the 14% growth excluding financial lines, and I think you said it was about 18% increase in price excluding financial lines. Maybe you could just talk about the drivers of that disconnect.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. You know, there has been a lot of chatter I\u2019ve noticed about that in the last number of months. It\u2019s actually pretty straightforward - the majority of the difference between the two numbers is a result of structural changes. Included in our price is the impact of things like deductible changes and attachment points, where we can put a value on it, and so it acts like rate or it acts like exposure. It doesn\u2019t add to premium necessarily, that portion of it, but it adds to potential margin, or another way of saying it, it supports loss cost.  The point of talking about rate and exposure that way, rather than by the way putting exposure over into loss ratio and saying, here\u2019s the loss ratio trend, which is different than loss cost trend, is to give a sense about that, and so here is the price we get, rate plus the trend, and yet a portion of the rate, depends on line of business, or of the exposure is actually not premium. As I said, it acts like premium but it\u2019s not premium. That\u2019s the difference between the two. Did I say that clearly for you?\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYes, yes. That makes sense. I guess maybe just a quick follow-up on that, any way to size terms and condition changes versus, I guess, the premium increase change, or if I were to look at the rate increase?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIt\u2019s in rate or it\u2019s in exposure. We look at it, but we don\u2019t go that far and start disclosing that. What you\u2019ve got to know is look at our overall premium growth, our retention rates that we give you - it\u2019s very healthy, and then what you can see is, wow, this is the amount of rate and price that goes against loss cost, so you can get a transparency around that. You don\u2019t add the two together, they\u2019re not comparable that way. They\u2019re answering two different questions.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it, okay. Yes, that makes sense. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. \n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nThen I guess just maybe on the North America commercial current accident year loss ratio ex-cat, was there--I know the second quarter tends to be an LPT--you know, heavy LPT quarter. Was there any of that or anything else, like non-cat property losses either way within the 70 basis points year-over-year improvement?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, and it\u2019s interesting - we\u2019re kind of looking at each other like, we haven\u2019t noticed that the second quarter in particular is a heavy LPT quarter. They kind of come lumpy through the year.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou\u2019re welcome."

First of all, where exactly does that live in the disclosures - is that in financial lines as well, and curious if you could give an update on the size of that book and how you\u2019re feeling about that business from a rate adequacy standpoint.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, as you statutorily have seen, we write a sizeable book, and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve disclosed the total global premium but what I would tell you is, is we\u2019re one of the top--you know, I don\u2019t have the updated numbers, so I want to be careful, but we\u2019re in the top 3 of cyber writers, maybe the top 2 of cyber writers globally. The business is growing in certain segments for us, but the overall business is growing and the rate environment has leveled off. Terms and conditions on what we underwrite are form. We were first to--really leaders to roll out a form that addresses systemic risk to a greater degree and addresses the severity in ransomware and other one-offs. The underwriting, we\u2019re vigilant about it. The growth, we\u2019re growing it. The pricing, it\u2019s pretty good in most segments. There\u2019s some segments that need rate, and in those areas we\u2019re leaning back a little bit. That\u2019s what I\u2019d tell you about cyber.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Appreciated the commentary, the line-by-line commentary on loss trend, but if I heard you correctly, I think you said workers comp, you\u2019re trending at around 4%--\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think I said about 4.7%, from memory.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nOkay, well that\u2019s, I guess, a little bit higher than I would have thought that line was running at. Are you seeing any type of pick-up in inflation there? Are you trending it differently than you have in recent quarters, or--?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWe\u2019ve increased it in the last--earlier in the year. You know, there\u2019s two things: one, mindful of medical inflation, and number two, payroll increases. On one hand, that benefits exposure change, as we just talked about rate and price, and on the other hand, wages go up and that translates to severity on the indemnity side. Those two things together rationally are going to push up your PIC on loss cost and comp.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

As you sit right now in Singapore and you look at your opportunity set, how would you rank concerns of capital deployment priorities, underwriting capacity given your views of achieving rate adequacy versus acquisitions in emerging markets, could even be JVs?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, I\u2019m not--first of all, we have plenty of capital flexibility. That is not a question. We are not constraining organic growth whatsoever, and I can tell you--I would make two comments to you. We are not on the acquisition hunt. We are focused on what we--there is so much opportunity around what we\u2019ve got and strategy around organic growth. In Asia, we are just full up, it\u2019s fabulous. In North America and other parts of the world, we\u2019ve got plenty of growth opportunity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after. We\u2019ve got a great rate environment to take on more exposure in areas like property, and we are taking--it\u2019s not a question of capital, it\u2019s a question of are you willing to take on the volatility that goes along with it, and we are because we think we\u2019re getting paid well for that. It\u2019s a good thing to invest in with shareholder capital, and that\u2019s our priority. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Then, you used the word JV. I read the same article, and you know what? Don\u2019t believe what you read.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nOkay, thanks. Yes, I wasn\u2019t implying that you don\u2019t have strong capital. I\u2019ve noticed that you reported $49 million of unfavorable reserve development for molestation claims - it\u2019s not a large number, but I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing right now on reviver statutes. Based on the work we\u2019ve done, are those charges reflecting the 11 states where new statute of limitation reform laws went into effect, or do the reserves also reflect the 38 states introduced new reform bills this year? \n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. You know, Tracy, it\u2019s more case specific. The only thing the reviver statutes as they open up them does, it opens up the top of the funnel, so more potential losses from years past, legacies going way back, events flowing to the top of the funnel, and then eventually some ripen, some percentage of them ripen into claims and cases, and ultimately in incurred. When we see a liability, we\u2019re going to reflect it.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nVery basic question here - does statute of limitations only apply to child abuse, or is it more broad-based?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, it depends on the state. It varies. Some have opened it up more broadly and some, it\u2019s only about--most, it\u2019s only about child abuse. \n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it, thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWait a minute - I think I have a colleague who may be correcting me about that. No? Okay. No. The answer was right."

Evan, looking at--you know, with Huatai going to be consolidated here and ownership increasing, life insurance is becoming a pretty meaningful component of your overall earnings mix - I think you\u2019ve got north of 10%. I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could give us a quick snapshot of what the business mix looks like there, how much is savings products versus indemnity products, short tail, long tail, is much of it capital intensive? Just give us some perspective on how we should think about that life insurance business.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou know, about 80%, 90% of the business is straight up accident and health business, the same kind of business we write on the non-life side. In the life side, you write a longer duration policy, and they\u2019re all individual policies, so on the non-life side I may direct market the same kind of products and they\u2019re annually renewable and they have a certain lapse rate to them, and on the life side I may sell through them agents and/or through direct marketing, and it\u2019s dread disease and it\u2019s hospital cash and it\u2019s cancer and it\u2019s accident insurance, and it will be sold predominantly--most of the book we have are individual policies and they are longer duration, which adds great stability, a long term asset. Then there is a percentage, but it\u2019s a minority percentage of the business where it\u2019s tied to a savings and protection policy, but yet we load it up with accident and health riders, so you\u2019re going to buy a large amount of protection, the stuff we love, alongside a very traditional, much lower risk savings product that\u2019s either on a par basis, where okay, any interest rate risk is fundamentally to the customer and we share the upside with them, or it\u2019s got extremely low guarantees, like in the 1% range or 2% in a whole life policy, that\u2019s it.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThe overwhelming majority of this business is risk-based accident and health business. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, that\u2019s really helpful. Then this one is more focused, I guess, on your personal lines business. I\u2019m just curious, could you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing happening in the regulatory environment, given the level of rate we\u2019ve seen going through in, like, personal auto and homeowners? Are you starting to see any pushback by regulators?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. It varies by state. I think it\u2019s pretty well known to you, it\u2019s not hidden. We are employing where we want to grow exposure and we need more flexibility of terms or of rates. We are using E&S to a greater extent as a tool to be able to take more exposure and do it in a thoughtful way and shape portfolios, and we do that both in states where exposure is concentrated in cat, and we\u2019re also doing it in states where the regulatory environment doesn\u2019t allow us greater flexibility to be able to actually serve the public\u2019s need. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou\u2019re welcome."

But we have a really distinct, strong brand, and Meyer, I think the recognition of our brand and service, all things being equal, more customers, it\u2019s proven, in our cohort want to buy Chubb, and then it\u2019s a question of price and terms. There have been competitors who have been overly competitive in the area, and I think of--you know, in the past, naively so or for other reasons, have underpriced risk. We\u2019re in a market know, I think, where there\u2019s greater discipline in the business, and that creates opportunity for us, in addition to the notion of others who may have gotten it wrong and they\u2019re pulling back.

I like the level of rate we are securing and the terms and conditions against the various cohorts of casualty we write, and I think we\u2019re--I know we\u2019re staying on top of loss development and loss trends, and then we reflect it in the pricing and the terms.

We\u2019ve been doing this for how long, how many decades, through all kinds of cycles, and look at our reserve policy and look at our reserving track record.

      "raw_bytes": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and welcome everyone to our September 30, 2023 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.com -- investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial statement -- supplement. And now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another outstanding quarter. Our performance was marked by double-digit global P&C premium growth, world-class P&C underwriting results, including an 88.4% combined ratio, record net investment income, and strong life operating income, all leading to record operating earnings per share. Once again, our premium revenue growth was well spread and broad-based, with excellent results in our commercial and consumer businesses in both our North American and international operations. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.5%, with a return on tangible equity of 21.2%. Core operating income of $4.95 per share was up 58% over prior year. And for the first nine months, we have produced record operating income of $5.9 billion, or $14.27 per share, up 27.5%. In the quarter, our underwriting performance was driven by a combination of strong earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins, which included an ex-cat current accident year combined ratio of 84.3%, or 83% excluding agriculture, favorable prior period reserve development in both North America and Overseas General and relatively average cat losses compared to our expected. P&C underwriting income of $1.3 billion was up almost 84%. Our positive reserve development speaks to the strength of our reserves and our reasonably cautious or conservative approach to reserving. As I've said for years, we generally strive to recognize bad news early and are slow to recognize good news. We're in a balance sheet business. Our loss reserves are the most important part of the liability side of our balance sheet. On the asset side, record-adjusted net investment income of $1.4 billion was up $361 million, or 34% over prior year. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% at the end of the third quarter versus 3.4% a year ago, while our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.2%. We have very strong liquidity, and our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. We are growing income without a change to our invested asset risk profile. In the quarter, we increased our ownership in Huatai Group to 69.6% and now we're consolidating results, which were accretive to EPS and ROE. Earlier this month, we closed on additional shares and our ownership stands now at over 72%. I expect this to increase further and reach between 83% and 86%. A summary of the financial impact of Huatai is provided for you in the earnings release and the financial supplement. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior-period reserve development, investment income, book value, ROE and Huatai. Now, turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 9% in the quarter, made up of 8.4% growth in our P&C business globally and about 15% in our Life division. Global P&C premium growth, which excludes agriculture, was 12.3%, with commercial lines up almost 10.5% and consumer lines up about 17.5%. In agriculture, crop premiums were lower than last year due to the timing of when we recognized them. Year-to-date premiums are in fact up modestly. As to the higher combined ratio in agriculture this quarter, we simply recognized a quarter earlier than last year what we think is the likely development for the year based on what we know today about crop conditions and pricing. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines, in aggregate, remained strong in the quarter in both North America and our international divisions, while decreases in financial lines in North America continued. We remain vigilant and diligent about staying on top of loss cost inflation. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 8.7%. P&C growth was 10.5%, excluding financial lines, which were up 1%. Our very large middle market division had its best quarter of the year with premium growth of 16.3% and middle market financial lines up 1.5%. Our major accounts and specialty division grew 7.2% with P&C up 8.4% and financial lines flat. Overall, pricing for total North America commercial increased 9.3%, including rate of 5.9% and exposure change that acts like rate of 3.2%. Let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Pricing for commercial property and casualty was up 13.9%. Property pricing was up 23%, with rates up 16.6% and exposure change of 5.5%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11%, with rates up 8.7% and exposure up 2%. In workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 5.5%, with rates essentially flat and exposure up 6%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.7%, same as last quarter. And again, that compares to pricing of 9.3%. In general, we're trending loss costs in short tail classes at 5.8%. And long tail, excluding workers' comp, loss costs are trending at 7.1%, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending at 4.7%. For financial lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O. Rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines, in aggregate, were down 4.8% and 3.8%, respectively. We're trending financial lines loss costs at 4.7%. Renewal retention for our commercial businesses in North America was 92.7%, and our new business grew 14%. On the consumer side, our high-net-worth personal lines business had another excellent quarter, with premiums up over 9.5%, with strong retention and new business growth. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 15%, while our selected loss cost trend was similar to last quarter at 10.5%. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Net premiums were up about 21.5%, and this includes a 7.5% contribution to growth from the Huatai consolidation. Our international commercial business grew 17.5%, while consumer was up 28.4%. In our international retail business, growth was broad-based with all major regions producing double-digit growth. Latin America led the way this quarter with premiu"

Latin America led the way this quarter with premiums up 23%, made up of commercial lines growth of 16% and consumer up more than 28%. Europe and Asia Pac had strong orders with growth of 14.2% and 10.2%, respectively. We continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio, with pricing up 9.3%, rates up 5.7%, and exposure change of 3.4%. Property and casualty lines, pricing was up 11.7%, with rates up 7.1% and exposure up 4.3%. While financial lines pricing was up 2.3%. Loss cost inflation across our international commercial portfolio remains steady from last quarter, trending at 6.6%. Within our international consumer, our A&H and personal lines divisions both had strong quarters, with premiums up 16.5% and over 40%, respectively. Personal lines growth in Latin America rebounded sharply with premiums up 43% on the back of growth in our Mexican auto portfolio where we're taking significant rate actions to reflect the loss cost environment. In our international life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums were up nearly 20%, including the impact of the Huatai consolidation. Life segment income was up nearly 15%, $288 million. In summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to outstanding year-to-date results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way, mindful of risk environment and underwriting conditions, which are favorable in many areas of our business. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings globally, which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C underwriting income, investment income, life income. I'm going to turn this call over to Peter, and then I'm going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, Evan, and good morning. First, I want to note that we completed our first quarter with Huatai Group as a consolidated subsidiary. The results of Huatai are reported at 100% within our financials, with only certain key metrics reported at the company's 69.6% ownership interest, including consolidated core operating and net income, book and tangible book value, and ROE measures. Turning to our results, Chubb reached two milestones this quarter: invested assets reached $130 billion, and adjusted net investment income topped $1.4 billion. Operating cash flow was a record $4.7 billion, reflecting our record investment income and strong premium collections. During the quarter, Moody's affirmed and moved our outlook from stable to positive. And as you know, S&P affirmed our groups rating with stable outlook earlier this year. Core operating ROE on a deployed capital basis is approximately 15.5% and the related operating return on tangible equity is approximately 27%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.6% and 7% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, reflecting outstanding results for both periods. Tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, decreased 4.2% for the quarter with 7.5 percentage points coming from the dilutive impact of consolidating Huatai. With the consolidation on July 1, Chubb had additional goodwill and intangibles of $3.5 billion pre-tax. In Q3, we already earned back almost two-thirds of that amount and expect to earn back the rest within this current fourth quarter. Huatai had a modest impact on results this quarter in line with expectations, adding $0.12 or 2.5% to core operating income per share, third of which related to the favorable impact of purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which will decline over the next year. As previously noted, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was a record $1.415 billion or $140 million above the top end of our guidance, of which $100 million is related to Huatai, which was not included in our prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to be approximately $1.435 billion to $1.45 billion on a recurring basis, including Huatai, and to continue to grow from there. We remain consistent and conservative with our investments, with 83% of our fixed income portfolio rated investment-grade and an overall average credit rating of A. This quarter, we recognized an unrealized loss on our portfolio of $2.2 billion after-tax, reflecting rising interest rates. We also recognized a modest favorable $18 million recovery of expected credit losses net of an immaterial impairment charge in the quarter, which attests to the overall quality of our portfolio. Huatai's investment assets added $12.7 billion gross or $6.4 billion attributable to Chubb to our investment portfolio. With over two decades as a strategic partner with Huatai, we have deep insight into Huatai's portfolio, and it fits well with our overall conservative approach to investing. 87% of Huatai's investment portfolio is fixed income related, and is very high quality, with an average credit rating of A and with 98.5% rated investment-grade. Turning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pre-tax catastrophe losses of $670 million, principally from weather-related events and wildfires in North America. Total catastrophe losses were split: 82% U.S. and 18% internationally. Prior-period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $261 million pre-tax. The PPD in our active businesses this quarter consisted of $316 million favorable development in short-tail lines and $55 million of unfavorable development in long-tail lines. Our corporate run-off lines had adverse development of $61 million, principally related to environmental exposures. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 73% and was 84% through nine months. This quarter reflects the impact of strong premium growth on reserves and the timing of our crop insurance payments. Our core operating effective income tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which is within our guided range of 18.5% to 19% for this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions."

      "raw_bytes": "[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBob Huang - Equity Research Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGood morning. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is actually on reserving. You obviously talked about recognizing bad news first and good news later. Curious about your thoughts on the recent development. European reinsurers have talked more about the cautionary view on the U.S. casualty reserves. Social inflation has been around for years, but this is clearly something that European reinsures are talking more about now. Just given their recent renewed caution, so to speak, on the U.S. casualty side, are there any adverse trends that you're seeing across the industry that would justify this view? Any specific factors that you would like to call out? Curious about your view on this. Thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, this is hardly a new topic, and I'm not going to really rehash old ground. We've been talking about this for a number of years. So, no, there's nothing new. And just look back on our quarters, look back on what we use for loss cost development. Reinsurers who just simply -- and we've been saying it, they've lagged in recognition. And so, they're just beginning to catch up to it. Welcome [indiscernible]. I really don't know what to add beyond that. There's no news to us. And frankly, I don't think there's really that much news to them. They've just been slow to be willing to recognize it. And when you fall behind on casualty, it's very painful. You got to catch up.\n\nBob Huang - Equity Research Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay, got it. That's actually very helpful. My second question is on cyber insurance. There has been a few very notable cyber breaches within consumer sector, casino, gaming, and more recently, a cybersecurity firm also had a pretty serious headline breach. Given Chubb is a industry leader in cyber insurance, curious -- and also given that your recent partnership with SentinelOne, curious about your view on how the recent headline news could impact pricing environment as well as the industry as a whole? And then, how you think about Chubb positioning in cyber insurance going forward?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah, cyber is a relatively new line for the industry. It's been around a number of years, but when you view it relative to other lines of business, it's relatively new exposure. And by the way, it's an evolving exposure. The world is more interconnected in everything today, for example, than it even was -- more so than it was three years or five years ago. The world is a hostile environment, geopolitically and from a criminal element point of view. The ability to use cyber as a tool of mischief or worse and for ill-gotten gain is evolving. The tools that those actors use are evolving. At the same time, the industry, and Chubb included, are improving our ability to manage the risk and to underwrite and provide risk management capabilities around these exposures. So, on one hand, the criminal element is gaining more tools. And at the same time, law enforcement and those like our industry are gaining better tools and better insight. It's both. So, it's evolving. It's an active environment from a loss point of view, frequency and severity of loss. And industry pricing and industry coverage has to reflect that. I notice it in some segments of the business where I think there is discipline. And then, there are other segments of the business that I think could use more discipline. And the good news about crop, around crop cyber, unlike, say, casualty, it reveals its secrets quickly. And so, if you're too loose in your underwriting and you're just chasing the market share, you're going to get caught pretty darn quick. And I'll stop right there.\n\nBob Huang - Equity Research Analyst (Morgan Stanley):"

Good morning to you as well.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nYeah. So, I was listening to your comments and you mentioned -- you highlighted the Mexican auto business. You obviously highlighted the success of your North American personal lines business. It feels like we're dealing with a once in a generation hard market in the auto insurance market. And I know you have a specialty business for your personal lines in North America, but I'm wondering if you have any thoughts of branching out into other areas of the market considering all of the dislocations that are occurring there?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIn general, personal lines market in North America, that's not a market for us. We don't bring anything to that party. And frankly, I think it is a well-served market. Some would suggest it's over-served. We have a -- not a -- it's pretty big niche, high net worth in the United States, and our capabilities and our insights are just so specially built for that, that we have a real true franchise advantage. We're distinctive, and that's what we look for. When you get outside the United States, general auto -- general market auto and homeowners, it's a commodity business, and most chase it for volume rather than for a decent return on underwriting. We're very selective of how we do it. We constantly search and research environments around the world where it can suit our approach to underwriting and we can bring a distinct advantage to the marketplace and build a franchise of size that has a competitive advantage. For a number of reasons, Mexico is one of those for us where we insure over 2 million autos, and we run a combined ratio that is the envy of the industry.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nThanks for the color there. I guess, I'm going to pivot to this follow-up question on -- back to the reinsurance business. I think I asked you about this in the previous quarter, but it's just striking to me when I look at your global reinsurance business and I don't see a lot of growth in the top-line. I know you are growing your property exposures, but where there's a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace about where we are with the 1/1 renewals with pricing and reinsurance, I thought I'd ask you about your views on how you think pricing for reinsurance is going to evolve over the next year. If I look at your top-line results, it probably isn't -- probably don't have a favorable view, but throw that out for you to comment on, please.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah. Greg, last year in the third quarter, so just the level set, there were, as you know, much larger cat events. And so, we collected a lot of reinstatement premium last year in the third quarter that we didn't have those level of cat events this year. So, if you adjust for that, our reinsurance business actually grew in the third quarter by 20%. So, just to level set about that, we're not running away from the reinsurance business. On the other hand, as I have said, I think it's a, for Chubb, it is a better trade to us to grow our insurance property and catastrophe-related exposure than it is to do it through our insurance -- our reinsurance operations. And so, we have put much more capital or taking more exposure on the insurance side where we've got great transparency, we've got great distribution reach, we've got underwriting expertise up and down the food chain from personalized to small commercial to large industrial commercial, the E&S, across North America, across the globe. And so, we're participating heavily and choosing to do it there. On the -- and we'll see what 1/1 produces, and if we like the risk-adjusted returns on a relative basis to insurance, then we would lean in and do more in the property cat area. But it's not -- the money's not burning a hole in our pocket by any means. On the other side, reinsurance casualty, as I just said, look, it's not a new story to us about casualty, and nor to our -- those who run our reinsurance business. They have the insights of Chubb's insurance business. And so, we've been very, very cautious and we've shrunk our market share significantly. If casualty re-improves to a point where it reflects the environment and you can earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, you'd see us right more there. Other than that, we've got plenty of handles to pull in Chubb, and we remain patient and cautious. It's the only way to outperform in the insurance business, as far as I know, overtime.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):"

      "raw_bytes": "Evan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGood morning, Evan. I guess I'll ask a question specifically on the North America commercial segment, and it's kind of has to do with, I guess, reserves too, taking off with some of the other questions. But if I just look at year-to-date, and this definitely isn't a Chubb-specific phenomenon, but I'll cite Chubb stats, reserve release levels running, let's just say, 50% below last year, 50% below even Chubb's like historical five years looking at our model. I guess it implies something has changed, And I guess the question we get from investors -- and by the way I'm cognizant the absolute combined ratio is great. But the question we get from investors is, if reserve release levels have changed so much, why haven't loss cost inflation assumptions changed materially? Is that anything you'd like to comment there?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nLoss cost inflation, let me tee off of that for a second. I think your mental model may not be exactly right. Loss cost inflation over the last two years and maybe longer, you've watched it step up our disclosed loss cost inflation. And when it steps up, it first impacts your view and therefore your pricing and your loss ratios for your current accident year. You then have to apply it going back on your in-force reserves. But your in-force reserves continue to develop. And as they develop, if they develop with more inflation in the current calendar year than you imagined, and you think it has credibility, then you have to adjust those reserves going back. And then, that informs your inflation factor you're going to use in the current period. And that's why you see inflation as loss cost inflation has evolved over the last few years with the notion of increase of frequency of severity in particular. You had the pandemic and those who I think were smart were careful and didn't imagine that patterns had changed even though you couldn't observe them and kept trending the same. But you trended the same and if inflation was a little worse when you look back on it, then you have to keep adjusting for that. We have produced, what I can tell, $600 million through three quarters or more of prior period reserve, positive development. That's on a trend of a net $800 million. And we've had legacy run-off exposure, asbestos, environmental, molestation, all of that included in that. I think when you look back historically on Chubb, the reserve development is pretty steady and pretty prudent there.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nThat's very helpful. I appreciate you partially correcting the way I was thinking about it. I guess my quick follow-up is, you've talked more than some of your peers about exposure acting as rates. And maybe it's not fair, but some of your peers say that only some exposure act as rate. I don't know if that's a conversation you want to have or you want to delve into whether you think the vast majority of Chubb-specific exposure really does act as rate more so than others, or anything you want to add there? Thanks.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, I think both comments are consistent. It depends on what line of business you're talking about. And we adjust our exposure, it's adjusted exposure. And therefore, it adjusts to reflect only that portion of the exposure that acts like rate. And that will vary by line, different for general casualty than it is for workers' comp. Different for property, how you look at it -- how you view it. So, the percentages and the ingredients, it varies by line of business. And that's reflected in how we look at it for ourselves and disclose it to you. And then, by the way, depending on the line of business, we also, to make it one step more complicated, but you don't need to worry, we just show you a net of it, we also, there's economic, and then we have insurance adjustments that can take exposure down. We increase retentions of a client in casualty. We increase deductibles in property. That's actually reducing exposure and that adjusts and gets netted.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

We just had better information. By the nature of this growing season, for instance, winter wheat -- you know that in the third quarter, and winter wheat, as an example, is under pressure this year relatively. And so that goes into the loss ratio number. California had storm events and et cetera that revealed losses earlier. So, we just had better data to be able to adjust this year in the quarter than we -- in the third quarter than we did last year where it really emerged very late, I think tail end of harvesting.\n\nPaul Newsome - Equity Research Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nOkay, that's great. And then different topics, a little bit on the reserve front. [indiscernible] and the other peers are talking about healthcare inflation being a good guy of late and helping out workers' comp reserves, in particular. Are you seeing some of the same effects there as well where the healthcare piece, which crosses all sorts of things in your business, is coming a little bit better than expected?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. We're -- in fact, we've used, and we -- not this quarter, we had done it in the past. We've reflected on a bit higher medical inflation trend, recognizing that medical inflation overall is more elevated. And what you see in a current period when you're booking an accident year, is only so relevant because comp has a tail to it and medical has a tail to it. And so, you reflect that -- at least here, we reflect that prudently and how we think about medical inflation when we construct our loss picks.\n\nPaul Newsome - Equity Research Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nAppreciate letting me ask questions.

So, we're hearing from some executives that they're voicing concern about medical loss environment looking ahead. While it's currently benign, there is a concern that it may be picking up. So, how are you thinking about that with regards to both kind of prior accident year reserves and forward appetite? And honestly, I'll leave it to you whether you want to discuss this on a company basis or what your views are with regards to the industry and how it has to approach this? And maybe even touch on which lines other than workers' comp, that I think we're all aware of, could be most impacted by that shift?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYaron, I think I just answered it. So, I'll repeat myself. We adjusted our loss picks to reflect in our inflation numbers we use. We adjusted to reflect our view of higher medical inflation already, and we did that a number of quarters ago. And we're steady in the use of that because we already raised it.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay.

If everybody wants to give me their's, I'll find on it, but I don't have much.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nWell, I guess I could maybe phrase it a different way. Since you have adjusted for this already, I would think that your pricing is also accordingly adjusted. Are you finding that your prices are still competitive with the industries? Or is the industry still essentially pricing for a lower loss inflation?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI don't see -- you're conflating two things. What people actually charge in the marketplace? And what their loss picks are, what their charge reflects? They may be reflecting the same things I reflect and they're willing to underwrite to 100%. And I'm not. So, I can't take that bait you're putting out there.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):"

Makes sense. The other question I had, North America Commercial, the underlying loss ratio improved year-over-year. Nonetheless, was a bit elevated relative to the first half. Were there any one-offs this quarter or in the first half? Or should we look at the year-to-date as a reasonable run rate?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYaron, take a step back, if you would, with me for a second. Look at the combined ratios we are putting on, they are world-class. They are unbelievably good. They're believable, because they're real. They are tremendous. North America's loss ratio year-on-year has improved almost half of it from what is a really world-class to begin with. It speaks for itself. These are great combined ratios. And when you look at sequential this or you look at that, I just don't relate to that.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nFair enough. And certainly great combined, no...\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIt's like -- it's tremendous. And you take that kind of -- those kinds of underwriting margins, you add stronger premium growth to it, you look at what I think is responsible pricing across the portfolio, ex cat for an accident year for insurers right now are going to look lower because everybody is more cat-levered in their pricing -- in their combined ratio because they're writing more property and they're getting the price on -- probably they're writing more property and taking more cat exposure, of course. And the real action to me is, therefore, what's your published combined ratio? Are you charging adequately? And by the way, that includes are you charging adequately for your property and property cat exposure? There'll be volatility quarter-to-quarter, but over a period of time and masked within there, what are you picking for your casualty combined ratios? And how are you underwriting for that? And when you mix the two together, you better be running a pretty darn good current accident year ex cat combined ratio. That's more of the way I would be thinking about this if I was on the outside.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):"

I mean, it's been pretty competitive here for a while. I know that we've talked about the cyber losses coming through. What are you seeing there?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, I'm not seeing. It's pretty -- this industry just has -- does what I think is a pretty dumb stuff at times. And financial lines is a very broad category. It has everything from public D&O to private D&O, non-profit D&O, errors and omissions of all kinds, cyber insurance. So, it's a real dog's breakfast of a lot of different lines. And each one goes to its own drum right now a bit. There are large pockets in there that I think are stable and/or managed adequately or handled decently. Then you have a couple where, my God, the number of MGAs that have pens today and the amount of capacity that proliferates. And by the way, a lot of that capacity coming back to the same balance sheet aggregating back, and you've got this sort of circular firing squad, which we tend to do now and again. It's in those areas that I don't see green shoots. And then the rest behaves reasonably to me. So, I wouldn't lump -- my first message to you, don't lump financial lines altogether. And then secondly, there's a couple of dumb areas.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. And then my second question, Evan, a little bigger picture here, just thinking about just generally, the general casualty lines here. As you kind of pointed out, really attractive combined ratios that you're printing and in the industry in general. And now we're also looking at long-term interest rates that are, gosh, decade high, right? Are we seeing any weakness at all from a pricing perspective? Do you anticipate that's going to start happening here in the next 12 months, just given the return profile of the business and how attractive it is?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI haven't seen it really, because higher interest rates are also a proxy for loss cost inflation. So, you've got an industry that I think is trying to stay on top of loss cost or has that impetus behind them to stay on top of loss cost in casualty. And other than in workers' comp, it hasn't been totally benign as you well know, and it's been around for a while. So, I think that higher yields are ameliorating. And by the way, if you do the math and you translate the higher yields to what it means to earn the same return, what combined ratio affect you would get to achieve the same return, it's modest in combined ratio relatively, 1 point here, 1 point there, it's not like, wow, I can raise my combined ratio as 5 points to achieve the same 15%, as an example, risk-adjusted return. No, you can't, and we run the math.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):"

Where do you see the growth opportunities looking ahead?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah. Well, we touched a bunch on it last quarter, and I'm going to just -- it doesn't change in two or three months. So, I'm going to reiterate it a bit to you. We operate in 12 countries in Asia. Half our business is commercial, half is consumer. And the consumer spreads across non-life and life. We're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia easily. And our life and non-life operations work closely together. We have huge digital capabilities that have grown out at dust. And the world is converting in direct response marketing from phone-based to digital to a combination of the two. Our agency operations for distribution, our brokerage operations for distribution, we play up and down the food chain of lower middle market right through to the largest corporate and we segment distribution and product that way. And it is across 12 distinct markets. Asia and North America are the two regions, I think that will have the greatest economic growth potential over the next decade or two. And Asia, get out of China, Asia is very vibrant, very dynamic. North Asia, older population. Southeast Asia with over 700 million people, young populations, and those economies are growing more quickly and they're emerging. Look at Vietnam today. Look even where Indonesia is going today. Singapore, those markets are all -- and Thailand, those markets are so dynamic with a lot of opportunity, but it's hard work. You have to really know those markets, and we've been there for decades. And we have spent the time to build and build and build capability on a local market basis. It's nothing to say you're in Asia. It's where are you in your capability in Thailand or Vietnam or any of these markets. They're distinct and you've got to have local capability, knowledge and a good command and control around underwriting. I'm very energized about what I see for this company over time in Asia. And I think it will continue to represent over time a greater share of our business. Thanks for the question.\n\nAlex Scott - Equity Research Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and welcome everyone to our December 31, 2023 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. We had an outstanding quarter and finish to the year, in fact a record year. Our quarter\u2019s results included double digit premium growth, record P&C underwriting and investment income and strong life operating income, all leading to exceptional operating earnings on both the per share and dollar basis. Our results, both earnings and book value related were also positively impacted in a significant way, by a one-time deferred tax benefit related to Bermuda\u2019s new income tax law.  While the quarters results are impressive and important, the full year results that really matters most. All things being equal, one quarter hardly tells a story. Our full year results were simply stunning. Core operating income top $9.3 billion, up 45% or $8.2 billion, excluding the tax benefit, up 28%. P&C underwriting income was a record $5.5 billion, with a combined ratio of 86.5% and investment income was up 33% and top $5.3 billion. As you can see, the balance between underwriting income and investment income was about 50-50, a very healthy balance. Life income was over $1 billion, while consolidated premium revenue growth was 13.5% for the year.  For the year, our core operating ROE was 15.4%. And our return on tangible was 24.2%. Tax benefit contributed, so excluding that our core operating ROE was 13.6%, and our tangible ROE was 21.6%. Excellent numbers.  Finally, for the year, per share of book intangible book value each group by over 20%. All divisions of the company in major geographies contributed to these outstanding results last year. And I want to congratulate and thank my colleagues around the globe. Our results speak to the global nature of this organization, which is one of the things that distinguishes Chubb.  Our fundamentals are very strong, in the quarter itself was simply a continuation of the year. For the quarter for operating income was $2.3 billion, excluding the tax benefit, or $5.54 per share, up 36% and 39% respectively. The one-time tax benefit then added $1.1 billion or $2.76 a share. Our underwriting performance in the quarter was a result of stronger earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins with the published combined ratio of 85.5% and a current action at year of 84.3%. We had strong prior period reserve developments in both North America and Overseas General and relatively light CAT losses. P&C underwriting income for the quarter was $1.5 billion.  Our prior year reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $177 million and $773 million, respectively, which speaks to the consistent strength of our loss reserves. At year end, our loss reserves were in an exceptionally strong position, as strong as they have ever been.  On the invested asset side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.5 billion was up $369 million, with 33% over prior year. Our portfolio yield at the end of the year was 4.3% versus 3.6% a year ago, and our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 5.3%. We have very strong liquidity and our investment income run rate continues to grow, as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. Peter will have more to say about financial items.  Now turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 13% in the quarter, with P&C up 12.5% and life up 20%. Of the P&C 12.5%, consumer loan lines were up 20% and commercial P&C was up 10%, which is in fact stronger than the full year average of 8.6%. Our premium revenue growth in the quarter was well spread globally. And from a broader perspective, for the full year, growth was 13.5%, with P&C uptown and life up 52%. Again Chubb is a globally diversified company. And our growth last year demonstrates the broad base nature of our operations.  North America, commercial P&C, a very large and important business, representing 40% of the company, grew 7.5%. The balance of the company, the other 60% grew 18%. U.S. high net-worth personal lines grew 11%. International consumer P&C grew 18%, international commercial P&C grew over 11%, and life grew 52%.  In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, the pattern was the same, as we have experienced all year, price increases in the quarter, and property and casualty lines exceeded loss costs in both North America and our International division. While globally, rates and prices continued to decrease in financial lines led by D&O.  Getting to the detail for the quarter and beginning with North America. Premiums were up 9.4% or 6.2%, excluding agriculture. Consisted of growth of 12.1% in personal insurance, and 4.4% in commercial insurance. Within the 4.4% P&C lines were up 6.3% and financial lines were down 2.1%. Unpacking the 4.4%, which was obviously slower than previous quarters, first, our middle market division had another strong quarter, with P&C premiums up 9.8%, while financial lines were essentially flat. Our E&S business had a strong quarter with growth of 16% in our wholesale brokerage lives. On the other hand, our divisions which serves large corporates, major accounts grew only 1.4%. Growth in Major was adversely impacted by about 7.5 points, or $125 million of premium from underwriting actions, we plan for and took in a segment of our primary and excess casualty business.  One-half of the reduction in premium was the result of increased client retentions, with the balance due to loss business. For clarity, these actions in fact, contribute to future growth in underwriting income.  Regarding future, North America commercial growth, as we said in the press release, given current market conditions and our capabilities across all segments of commercial P&C, including large accounts. E&S and middle market, we fully expect to return to more robust growth, beginning with the first quarter. Overall pricing for total North America commercial increased 7.3%, including rate of 5.1%. An exposure change that acts like rate of 2.1%.  Let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Pricing for commercial property and casualty was strong. Up 12.4%, property pricing was up 17.3, with rates up 12.9 and exposure change of 3.9. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.4%, with rates of 10.8% and exposure of 1.4%. And workers"

And workers comp, which includes both primary and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.6%, with rates of 1.1% and exposure up 3.5%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.6%, with short tail classes at 5.5% and long tail excluding comp at 7.3%. We are trending our first dollar workers comp book at 4.6%.  For financial lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly Indiana, and rates continue to decline. We know this business extremely well, at our trading growth for underwriting margin, at income, where we need to. In the quarter rates and pricing from North America financial lines in aggregate were down 6.1% and 5.5% respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at 5.1%.  For our agriculture business, late season, drought related developments in crop insurance, resulted in an elevated combined ratio for the quarter in the year. For context, we published a 95.4% combined ratio for the year and earned an underwriting profit of $146 million. Similar to the previous year\u2019s result. Crop insurance is a CAT like business, by its nature vulnerable to weather volatility, but with very good risk reward dynamics if managed well. Crop insurance has been a great business for Chubb. Rain and Hail is an amazing company, and since acquiring them in 2010, for about $1.1 billion, we burned almost $2 billion in operating profit with an IRR of 26%.  On the consumer side of North America, our high net-worth personal lines business had a simply outstanding quarter and year. In the quarter, premiums were up over 12% and new business growth was up 34%. There is a continued flight through our product, service and capability. We are the gold standard period. Again for the year the business grew almost 11% and published a combined ratio of 89.7% or 80.1% on a current accident year ex-cat basis. In our homeowner\u2019s business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss costs trend remains steady, 10.5%.  Turning to our international general insurance operations, which had an outstanding quarter. Net premiums were 19.3% and the combined ratio was 85.9%. Our international commercial business grew 13.2%, while consumer was up 29.5%. For the year, Overseas General grew 14%. And our international business growth this quarter was broad base, with all major regions producing double digit growth, again, illustrating the global nature of the company. Asia led the way with premiums up 37%, made up of commercial lines growth of 21% and consumer up 56%.  Europe and Latin America had very strong quarters as well, with growth of 15.5% above for both. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio. With pricing in our retail business up over 7%, Property and casualty line pricing was up over 10%, while financial lines pricing was down about 2%. Loss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8%. The P&C lines trending 6% and financial lines trending 4.9%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our A&H and personal lines divisions, both had strong quarters, and for the year, their growth was 14.4% and 21.4%, respectively. Growth again was led by Asia. In our international life insurance business, which is basically Asia, premiums were up 26%. For the year, we reported life income of just over $1 billion or about $950 million, adjusting for some non-recurring items.  So in summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to another record setting year and we are well positioned, to continue producing outstanding results going forward. Underwriting conditions overall are favorable, though they vary by business and geography. It\u2019s an underwriters market, and that's what we are. We have hit the ground running in \u201924, and while we are in the risk business, and volatility is a feature of that, we are confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a double digit pace, through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income, life income.  Now I\u2019ll turning the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back, to take your questions. \n\nPeter Enns - CFO (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you've just heard from Evan, our strong performance continued into the fourth quarter. And we ended the year with record results in all three sources of earnings. P&C underwriting income, investment, income, and life income. Additionally, our book value of nearly $60 billion and book value per share of $146.83 were both all-time highs.  Before I go into further detail on our results, I want to touch on the $1.14 billion, onetime deferred tax benefit recognized in the quarter. This tax benefit is a result of the Bermuda corporate income tax law enacted in December, which requires a one-time step up of the tax basis for assets in Bermuda to fair value. This one-time benefit represents a permanent increase to book value and tangible book value, and will be realized over a 10-year period starting in 2025. Please refer to Page 1b in the financial supplement for the impact of this benefit on our key metrics.  During the quarter per share book and tangible book value increased 12.2% and 20.2%, excluding the tax benefit. This increase reflects strong operating results and net realized and unrealized gains of $4.9 billion in our investment portfolio due to declining interest rates, partially offset by $1.1 billion of dividends and share repurchases. For the full year book and tangible book value per share increased 18.2% and 17.5%, excluding the tax benefit. The increase also included the diluted impact on the tangible equity related to Huatai consolidation on July 1, which has since been fully recovered.  Turning to investments our portfolio grew over 20% since last year, reaching $137 billion at year end and benefiting from record full year adjusted operating cash flows of $12.2 billion and the addition of the Huatai portfolio of approximately $7 billion net to Chubb. In addition, we experienced unrealized gains on our portfolio during the year of $3.1 million which again highlights the transient nature of these mark-to-market movements for a high-quality fixed income portfolio. This year, we continue to take advantage of an attractive interest rate environment, raising our portfolio yield to 4.3%, our highest since the third quarter of 2011. Our adjusted net investment income of $1.49 billion in the quarter included approximately $55 million of higher-than-normal dividend income and private equity distributions. Looking at, we expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.45 billion and to go up from there. Turning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pretax catastrophe losses of $300 million, principally from weather-related events, split 54% in the U.S. and 46% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $323 million pretax, with 81% in short tail lines predominantly from property and 19% in long tail lines. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $146 million pretax, including $99 million asbestos related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 87%. Our reported effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the Bermuda deferred tax benefit mentioned earlier. Excluding the tax benefit, our core operating effective tax rate would have been 17% for the quarter and 18.2% for the year, slightly below our guided range, reflecting higher income in some low tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of certain employee-related benefits due to rising equity markets. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for calendar 2024 to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%.  I'll now turn the c"

Please go ahead. \n\nMike Zaremski  - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe a first question on loss cost trend. We always appreciate all the granular color you gave. So in North America, it looks like short-tail loss trend came down a little bit, whereas the long-tail loss cost trend just inched up a little bit higher. And I feel on the -- if I look back over longer periods of time, the long-tail loss trend has -- I guess, directionally been inching higher for years now, I guess, ex the onset of the pandemic potentially.  But just curious, the underwriting result is excellent. Very clear that you feel like this is a good underwriting environment. What gives you comfort that if the long-tail loss inflation continues kind of inching higher that it is still a great underwriting environment in the year to come?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nWell, there's no certainty guaranteed. But, our loss cost trend in casualty, when I look at it, has been reasonably steady over the year. And you'll say it inched up really more on mix of business than anything else when I look at the individual cohorts. That's the vast majority, and it's not a material change. So -- and we have a lot of visibility on loss cost. There are some pockets that have been more elevated over the last number of years. It's nothing new. We have spoken about it continuously. But overall, I think casualty loss cost tracks while they are elevated due to the external environment, as we understand it to be, is reasonably steady elevated. And so that's what gives me a lot of confidence about it.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful color. Lastly, my follow-up, with the -- with great earnings levels, maybe Peter or Evan, you can update us on the drag from excess capital and whether we should be just kind of continuing to deploy a mix of it into to buybacks and then hoarding some for opportunistic M&A, if there's really no change to that.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nSo we had disclosed, I think, on the last call, the drag by showing the difference in reported ROE. I would say it's up somewhat from there, just reflecting a combination of new S&P models and some other factors. But it's somewhat above -- modestly above what we reported last quarter.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

And if there was any impact from some of the corrective actions on reserves?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nThere was no connection in the reserve changes to the underwriting actions that I flagged in my commentary, and that was in the press release. And by the way, there was another question. So I've noticed was our loss ratio in the quarter impacted by those changes.  No. I'll remind everyone loss ratio is based on earned premium, not written premium. And so any benefit we might see, which is very, very modest. Look at the size of our commercial business. We're talking about premium impact of $125 million. So you think of the loss ratio impact from it, very minor, but still it contributes. And wherever you see something that is a price right, we're structured, right. It's axiomatic P&C. You address it.\n\nDavid Motemaden  - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGreat. Okay. That's helpful. And I appreciate that on the go-forward impact. And then I guess, just my follow-up question, just on the growth in North America commercial on your expectations for 2024. Wondering maybe if you could just talk, I saw the casualty rates ticked up nicely in the quarter, but overall rate is down. I guess -- would you expect growth, if I were to look at 2023, 7.5% growth in North America commercial. Would you think the environment is good enough to produce higher growth than that or lower growth? Or I guess, how are you thinking about it for 2024?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nDavid, nice try. I don't give guidance as you know around any of that. The 7.5% is an interesting. You look at the growth rate prior to the fourth quarter action, it was more robust than that. And our thinking starts from there. And then you think about -- when you said about the rate action, yes, casualty was better. Property on the short-tail classes were therefore down a little bit, but I got strong double-digit growth in the property-related lines, rate and pricing, which is keeping pace with values. That's what that exposure changes. It's about keeping pace with values. And so it's a well-priced business and a well-priced book and you're getting rate on rate on rate. So of course, that's going to slow down but the underwriting environment for it and the rate to exposure, the risk reward is quite good. If you have the balance sheet and you have the ability to take on the exposure and the confidence as we do. I feel very good about North America as we go forward. So well underwritten business.\n\nDavid Motemaden  - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

In the press release and your comments, then you mentioned the fact that Chubb's loss reserves are as strong as they've ever been. So I'm curious what metrics you're looking at to make that determination. And the reason why I guess I'm asking is, I've kind of considered Chubb to always have strong reserves. So what's -- is there something that's changed inside your reserving philosophy or structure that gives you confidence that they're better now than they have been in previous years?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nNo, nothing has changed in that regard. You go through different underwriting environment. And the loss cost that is earned in over the years. I look at the mix of business, I look at our data and insight as the company has grown. And frankly, I just say all the loss reserve studies we do and then independently reviewed by external actuaries and by auditors. And I look at the end result and the strength of it. And it's a very simple statement to make. When I look back and track it over years that our reserves are as strong and as robust as we have ever seen.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. And then another calls out, you talked about the large account excess casualty business. And I know you provided some color on your comments. So just looking for a little bit more detail. There's obviously been noise in the market about casualty and maybe the success casualty is one of the sensitive subjects that's hitting the marketplace. But any additional color there would be helpful.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nSure, Greg. If you look back over time, some of the things that I have said, and I'm going to repeat them because I think they maybe to some degree for some people to go in one ear and out the other, and then there are moments where it really sticks. When you look at the external litigation environment, the target, first and foremost, is corporate America. Not small business, not midsized business, but larger business. There's a general attitude among segments of the population against corporations. Trial bar like Willy Sutton, if they're going to ask them, \"Why do you rob banks?\" he said, because that's where the money is. And so they go after large corporations. Number two.  Number three, we know there has been a trend of increased frequency of severity which hits both primary but excess casualty. Nothing new, I've been talking about it for quite some time. And then there's a lot of visibility that particularly acute in exposure that has wheels, anything with wheels. It could be logistics companies, trucking, companies anybody who's got fleet and the larger the vehicles in the fleet, the more of a target, it is and has been. That's what you're -- that story has continued. And there's been inflation in both frequency and severity in that, nothing new. And that is the theme in large accounts. And it's pretty focused and directed. It doesn't mean balance of casualty doesn't have elevated loss cost, which has been, I just addressed, which has had a lot of visibility and is steady. But it has been more acute in isolated segments.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

But it's clearly been a place that's frustrated you more recently. I'm just curious, there's no risk here that any of the actions you're taking could somehow change the significance -- the strategic significance of that franchise several years down the road? Is there?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nOh my God, no. You're overthinking. No. And this is -- you look at the actions that we just flagged, half of it is exposure change and half of it is additional written premium that we lost. Since then, by the way, the market is beginning to catch up at similar actions and no impact to the franchise. It's not like we're wholesale underwriting our book of business.

Quite strong. I'm not going to go into any more detail other than to say that and we triangulate it numerous ways, but it's quite strong. From everything we know, all the models and the balance of input and our analysis of the portfolio, hikes of occupancies, geographies it's in, perils it's exposed to, you add it all up.

And how much opportunity there is for that shift in 2024?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nYes. It's -- I'm not going to give you a dollar amount or a data point that way, except that directionally, we are writing more business on E&S. It is growing at a rapid clip. It will continue to. Our preference is always to offer our customer first admitted, but where the states and regulation don't allow us to tailor coverage for those who were exposed in a more outsized way to catastrophes. Remember, affluent people want to live in beautiful places that are right on the edge of civilization in nature, and its more CAT-exposed and where we can't tailor coverage in line with exposure, we'll use it and price it adequately. We use the E&S. And that's what we're doing. But again, I think that -- and I wish it was more flexibility within regulation, within jurisdictions so that we could serve this customer base on an admitted basis versus be forced to E&S to give them what they need and that they want to buy.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Understood. That's very helpful. Second question is sort of the same theme. Within agriculture, at least on the crop side, can you talk about how you can manage through climate change risks where you don't have flexibility in pricing or policy language?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nBut there's a difference. In agriculture, we have a ton of data. We have a couple of very fundamental advantages. Number one, we can select risk. And so we can determine -- we have to take all commerce. So we can determine what risk to retain and which risk to share with the government. And that's what helps you with this election is what helps you in managing to price adequacy. And the second thing, we have scale. And you only get reimbursed so much of their expenses out of the government program because of our scale and our technology and automation, we operate efficiently. So we limit any expense-related exposure to the company. And that allows us to operate on a favorable risk.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much."

And I think you said you would like to have the flexibility of continuing to offer the product in the admitted market. What's the difference from your perspective? Why would you like the admitted market over E&S?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nWell, it's customer friendly. And I think just from a customer point of view, they just feel it's easier to place with us. You don't go through -- you have to go through more administrative process to place it on E&S. Remember, there are -- you can't just jump to E&S, you have to be able to leap through admitted market hurdles to get to E&S. And it's simpler and I think for them, from their own point of view, it's more comfortable. Now to keep it in perspective, the vast, vast majority of our portfolio is admitted. And then it's on the margin right now that it is not admitted. But my point is I don't like the trend. More will go on non-admitted climate change continues and states take the wrong action to try to cover up price and deflect price signals and ability to risk share with people who -- out of the well and choose to live in places that are more exposed. And I think there would be more flexibility and recognition of that consumer base and their needs and their desires and not force them to go through all they have to go through to place on [indiscernible].\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nMakes sense. I appreciate the answer. And then if I could shift gears to China. I think you called out about $100 billion of AUM that are managed in China, mostly third-party capital. Just curious how you're thinking about that book in the face of, I guess, some selling consumer and business sentiment in China and maybe the equity market performance there. How do you go about -- are you making any shift in how you're managing the book with that?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nYes. It's -- first of all, let's not think of it as book. It's an asset management business, that $100 billion. We have an asset management company that does retail, does mutual fund and very large institutional money management including state pension money. The vast majority of it is fixed income. We underwrite the credit exposure extremely carefully, you don't chase yield. We do it in a conservative way the way we've been fiduciary managers of our policyholders' money. It's how we treat investors' money. And China is a lower interest rate environment now. Equity market with a lot of volatility, not a lot of confidence in the economic short-term, medium-term future among business and consumer. So it's not the best time to be managing and trying to grow an asset management business. But all of our thinking and plans of that in mind and like everything else, it's a moment in time when the country returns to more rapid growth, when confidence begins to come back because government addresses and manages sentiment and the economy a bit differently than they are today, which I think, over time, they'll be forced to. This is a great franchise to have. And by the way, if you look at its rankings, it's outstanding performance rankings in the marketplace, for its collapse of fixed income. And secondly, in its size relative to other asset managers in China. It's actually -- it's in that upper midsize category. It's a pretty cool asset.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

And then are there any severity stress points that we should pay attention to?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nNo. We're not going to unpack it between frequency and severity. It's running very steady. We recognize a higher medical loss trend. We adjusted for that and disclose that a quarter or two ago. Workers' comp is behaving in a very steady way.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. Got it. Thank you. My second question kind of is more of a geopolitical risk related question. Obviously, a large portion of your business Overseas, still performing very strong. But it feels like geopolitical risk really hasn't improved so far versus 2023. Is it possible to kind of give an update in terms of how you think about the risk associated in your business in Asia and Europe and how you think about the broader opportunities outside the U.S.?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nWell, I don't think the geopolitical risk for Europe and our business in the EU. I don't think they have a political risk, geopolitical risk exposure any greater fundamentally than we do in the United States. And so if you're concerned for Europe in a significant way, then you better be concerned right here at home in America. When I get to Asia, I don't believe that the United States and China are going to war. And I think all sides seek a stability. And so while there is OEs tail risk, in Asia related to North Korea, related to Taiwan, in particular, I think it's more risk at this moment around someone making a mistake. By the way, I'm going to leave you with this. The mental model, if there is a conflict in Taiwan, where there is a conflict to do with North Korea, it is hard to believe it will confine itself to a small geography. We then have a major global issue. And I think those were in leadership position on all sides are acutely aware of us and they too, care about their children and their grandchildren.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay, thank you very much for that.

And then on the tax rate side, Peter, I know you said you gave us guidance for '24. But what about in 2025 when the Bermuda tax rate goes up? How should we think about that impacting the tax rate at Chubb?\n\nPeter Enns - CFO (Chubb Limited):\nYes, it's too complicated and early to know in terms of how the Bermuda law will interact with whatever gets adopted at OECD, Switzerland and the U.S., we really don't have any visibility on it.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then one more for you. In your press release, you pointed to growing operating earnings at a double-digit pace. I'm assuming that's a comment if we adjust for the one-off tax benefit in the quarter that you expect operating earnings can grow double digits in '24. Is that how we should take that comment?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nYes, Elyse.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

I am not able to hear it. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):\nHuatai, the benefit that, that had of including it in premium growth in the quarter?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nHuatai had a premium benefit in the quarter. We didn't disclose it. We disclosed it last quarter and said from here, it's just in there. It was from memory, it's just a couple of points. We'll take it offline with you, but it wasn't -- we'll have more color in the 10-K MD&A on a couple of lines.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):\nGreat. That's helpful. And then my second question, maybe bigger picture here. The trucking business in the U.S., I mean, we continue to see some really bad kind of severity in the long-haul trucking business. Is there any solution to that? Or is it simply just getting enough rate?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO (Chubb Limited):\nNo. getting enough rate is -- that's what we have to do. But that doesn't solve the problem for American trucking, which we need a healthy trucking industry. And you certainly want to take the inflation out of shipping rates. And this all contributes, you end up paying for it. It's really a state-by-state solution, and that -- how they -- the amount of awards that are handed out. And by the way, look at simple laws like, who is responsible in a liability event and how it varies by state. There are states where you may have 1% responsibility. And you're the deep pocket, and you are allocated 100% of the cost. There are states that -- where there's a comparative negligence, both parties are at fault and look at how it varies, how they determine who is ultimately adjudicated to pay for the cost. When you look at those right there, you can see a part of the problem that is occurring. Particularly where trucking company is 1% or considered 2% at fault. Again, they're adjudicated 100% of the payment suffering and injury of that individual. That's a state-by-state problem. Look at litigation funding and look at what -- how many states require that you simply disclose who's funding the lawsuit. Because that has an impact on how injury will then view the injured party. They always march out the most sympathetic individual but is it all about sympathy to the individual? Or are they used as a prop to actually get a big payday for somebody who's funding the lawsuit. That's a state by state. And if you were looking for a federal solution, my God, we can't even agree on a budget and we can address the deficit or entitlement spending. Morgan would address this when the trial bar is funding half of Congress.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):"

I think when all of a lot of that naive hungry capital that is trying to make some money for themselves at the expense of the balance sheets that are funding it, when that all gets tired and loss cost catch-up, which is not far off with the level of pricing being charged, then there'll be an adjustment and Chubb is there, and we're a large writer of the business.

Please go ahead. \n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our March 31, 2024, First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters.   We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. I'd like to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. We had an excellent start to the year. Core operating income was up double digit, driven by all 3 sources of income. P&C underwriting income was up over 15% with a published combined ratio of 86%. Investment income was up more than 23% and life insurance income was up almost 10%. We produced double-digit premium revenue growth from across the globe with strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C and international life businesses. Core operating income was up over 20% to $2.2 billion and operating EPS was up nearly 23%, $5.41. As you saw, our earnings and EPS benefited modestly from 2 onetime items that partially offset each other. Adjusting for these, they were up 18.6% and nearly 21%, $5.33.   Again, our P&C underwriting income was up over 15% to $1.4 billion, driven by strong earned premium growth and great underwriting margins. The ex-CAT current accident year combined ratio was 83.7%. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income of nearly $1.5 billion was up 23.5%. We now have more than $140 billion in invested assets, up over 19% in the last 2 years. And our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9% versus 4.4% a year ago. Our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.1%. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow well as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates. Life segment income of $268 million was up 9.8%. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.7%, with a return on tangible equity of nearly 22%. Peter will have some more to say about financial items.   Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 14%. For Global P&C, which excludes agriculture, net premiums increased 13.3% in the quarter with commercial up over 11% and consumer up over 19%. P&C premium growth in the quarter again was balanced broad-based globally between areas of the globe and commercial versus consumer, reflecting favorable underwriting and market conditions overall. Life insurance premiums and deposits were up over 39%, driven by our business in Asia and came from a number of countries and distribution channels.   Huatai contributed 2.9% and 20.6 percentage points, respectively, to the global P&C and life growth results. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions were quite favorable in both property and casualty, and price increases exceeded loss cost while rate decreases in financial lines slowed. So starting with North America, premiums, excluding agriculture, were up over 10%, and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal insurance and about 9.5% growth in commercial. P&C lines up 13% and financial lines down about 7.5%. If we adjust the P&C growth to the net impact from 2 items in the major accounts division, P&C lines normalized growth was a very strong 11.6%.   The 2 items were an unusually large structured transaction we wrote partially offset by the previously discussed corrective underwriting actions in primary and excess casualty that are continuing to wind down over the next few quarters. By the way, that large structured transaction negatively impacted North America commercial's combined ratio by over 0.5 point, the loss ratio impacted by over 1 point. Excluding this impact, unmasks the current accident year combined ratio run rate.   Supporting North America P&C growth was record new business of over $1.2 billion at a very strong renewal retention on a policy count basis of 84.7%. Both speak to the tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 12% with our large account retail business up 12% and our E&S business up about 10.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7% with P&C lines up 10.6% and financial lines down 6.5%. Again, the P&C market environment in North America overall is quite favorable and rational, financial lines aside. Pricing increased 12.8% including rate of 9.4%, an exposure change that acts like rate of 3.1%.   From our very large middle market business to small commercial to personal lines, and driven by both property and casualty, we saw the best rates in pricing overall that we've seen in the last 4 to 5 quarters. It was one of the best quarters for large casualty pricing. In our North America business, rate increases for property and casualty exceeded loss cost trends, let alone pricing, which was even stronger. So let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Property pricing was up 13%, with rates up 7.8% and exposure change of 4.8%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 13.1% with rates up 10.9% and exposure up 2%. And in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.8% with rates up 0.2% and exposure up 4.6%. Loss costs in North America are relatively stable and in line with what we contemplate in our loss specs.   We are trending loss costs at 6.8%, short-tail classes at 5.3% and long tail, excluding comp at 7.6%, trending our first dollar workers' comp book at 4.6%. For financial lines, the underwriting environment and a number of classes in a word is simply dumb. Rates continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. We are, of course, trading growth for underwriting margin and income where we need to. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines in aggregate were down 3% and 2.7%, respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at just over 5%.   On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter. This is a powerhouse business, over $5.5 billion in premium last year and it grew over 12% in the quarter with new business growth of nearly 35%. It speaks to a franchise and a class of its own in terms of service and capability. Premium growth for our true high net worth Premier and Signature segments, the group that demands the most underwriting and servicing, grew 16.5%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss cost trend remained steady at 10.5%. While a small quarter, our agriculture business had a very good underwriting result as the '23 crop year turned out a bit better than we projected.   Turning to our international general insurance operations. Net premiums were up 17.5% or 16.7"

Net premiums were up 17.5% or 16.7% in constant dollars. Our international commercial business grew 11.4%, while our consumer was up over 26%.  Growth this quarter was geographically diverse with all major regions contributing, which again illustrates the true global nature of the company. Asia led the way with premiums up 40%. Excluding Huatai's contribution, premiums were up 7.7%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 13%, while the continent of Europe grew 10.3%. We continue to achieve positive breakthrough exposure across our international commercial portfolio. Retail property and casualty lines pricing, up 5.5% and financial lines pricing, down 2.3% million.   Loss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8%, with P&C lines trending 6.1% and financial lines trending 4.8%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our Personal Lines division had an exceptional quarter with constant dollar growth of 47%, led by Asia and Latin America. By the way, the modest increase in Overseas General's ex-CAT current accident year combined ratio this quarter was primarily due to the consolidation of our China business.   In our international life insurance business, which is overwhelmingly Asia, premium and deposits were up over 50% in constant dollar, with strong contributions from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and Korea. Excluding Huatai Life, premiums and deposits were up over 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency, brokerage and direct marketing distribution channels. Lastly, Global Re had a strong quarter with premium growth of almost 30% and a combined ratio of 76.9%. We allocate incrementally more CAT capacity to our reinsurance business and grew both our CAT excess and risk property portfolios, in particular, this quarter.   In summary, we had an excellent quarter and start to the year. We remain well positioned to continue producing outstanding results through the balance of the year and beyond. We remain confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a rapid pace through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and lifing.   Now I'm going to turn it over to Peter and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions. \n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, Evan. As you all just heard, we continue to build on the momentum of our record 2023 year with strong growth in top line and earnings per share this quarter. We continue to effectively manage our balance sheet and ended the quarter in a strong financial position, including book value that exceeded $60 billion in cash and invested assets of $143 billion, each topping last quarter's all-time highs. Adjusted operating cash flow was $3.6 billion. There were 2 onetime earnings items this quarter that I would like to touch on. First, we recognized an incremental $55 million deferred tax benefit related to the new 2023 Bermuda corporate income tax law. This resulted from finalizing our review of 2 smaller subsidiaries since last quarter. We don't expect additional deferred tax gains related to this law going forward.  Second, there was a contribution made to the Chubb Foundation, charitable foundation of $30 million pretax or $24 million after tax. These items provided a net benefit of $0.08 per share. Additionally, there were 2 other noteworthy items in the quarter. In March, we issued $1 billion of 10-year debt to retire existing debt due to retire -- mature in May 2024. Lastly, we closed on an additional 9% of shares of Huatai that brought our ownership interest of 85.5%. This leaves the last tranche of less than 1% of outstanding Huatai shares remaining to close. During the quarter, book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, from December 31, driven by strong operating results partially offset by $350 million in dividends and $316 million in share repurchases in the quarter.  Turning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.48 billion, slightly beating our guidance of $1.45 billion. We expect our adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion next quarter and to go up from there.  Turning to underwriting results. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $435 million, which is modestly lower relative to prior year and is principally from winter storms and other weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $216 million pretax with favorable development of $311 million in short tail lines, primarily from property and credit-related lines, and $95 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines, which was primarily from excess casualty and was within our range of expectations.  Our corporate runoff portfolio had unfavorable development of $9 million pretax. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 84%. Our reported core effective tax rate was 15.2% or 17.3% for the quarter, excluding the update to our Bermuda tax benefit. As I've said before, our first quarter tax rate also tends to be the lowest of the year, due to certain tax benefits associated with equity award vesting and stock option exercises. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%.   I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. \n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take the questions."

Evan, I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more detail on the $95 million of unfavorable reserve development on the long tail lines that you guys took this quarter? And maybe just unpack that a little bit more would be helpful. \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. Look, we recognized over $200 million of reserve releases, so to give perspective. And that included adverse development of $95 million in North America commercial lines long tail. It was not concentrated in any one period, it was spread out from '16 forward. It was predominantly large account excess casualty, auto related in areas we've discussed. Trucking, logistics companies, companies with large commercial fleets and it's the business we've been addressing in terms of rate and underwriting actions and in that case, think retentions.  And our loss picks that reflect our action. The -- in fact, when we talk about that we gave you color around that we had this large LPT that was larger than usual. And then we offset to a degree by the underwriting actions that we've been taking. You heard it all last quarter. It will run 2 or more -- maybe 2 more quarters. That's all related back to the same business as you know. So there's the mental model. The development was not a surprise because we continually track actual versus expected activity for all product lines. And we had continued to observe higher-than-expected loss activity for this business. So we study it more deeply this quarter. And we took as we always will. We took the bad news and we are slow to recognize good news, no different than I said last quarter, our reserves are really strong. \n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then I did notice that the commercial casualty net premium written growth accelerated during the quarter and you mentioned -- you also mentioned the rate increases accelerated a little bit in the quarter as well in commercial casualty. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about balancing all the elevated uncertainty in the environment with leaning into growth, which it seems like you guys are doing a little bit? \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, the growth is coming. It wasn't a little bit. It was a step change in the rate we got exceeded loss costs, let alone pricing, which includes exposure change. And that is what contributed substantially to the growth. We grew exposure as well, particularly in our middle market long-tail business.   Though there was some growth in particular lines in large accounts as well where the pricing -- the vast majority of our book is adequately priced in casualty, and we're getting rate that recognizes loss cost trend, and so we maintain the adequacy. And then the stress classes, which need rate to hit our target combined ratios. That's where rate has accelerated in the market, and we -- because the market is also reacting, we're able to achieve and grow the business to a degree. Otherwise, we get the rate, like the business. And there were 1 or 2 classes where that's occurring."

      "raw_bytes": "Michael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOn the topic of social inflation, I think, I'm assuming when we think about the social inflation that the main way to tackle it is risk selection and pricing, et cetera. But I recall in your shareholder letter, Evan, you talked about working or maybe you can elaborate, you and others have talked about kind of -- it sounds like a more concerted effort to lobby efforts or to maybe state by state see if there could be some reforms. And so just curious if you could elaborate if there's anything changing there in terms of what Chubb or the industry is doing to maybe tackle it from the back end or... \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. First of all, our loss picks reflect the reality of the environment, the inflation we observe. And that includes any actions as we know them to be that might ameliorate it around tort reform. Tort reform is going to be a long-term never-ending process. As you say, it's not going to be federal. State by state, it could be county by county, depending. And it depends on the class of business as to the kind of reform that's required to bend that curve and loss cost. The insurance industry can support tort reform and does. The insurance industry can't particularly lead it. We don't have the printing press. This is ultimately paid for by corporate America, and it's paid for by consumers, by the products and the services from corporate America, it's a tax on everybody.  If you look at it in a clear eye way, we reflect the inflation that we see, whether it comes from social inflation, so-called social inflation, or other causes in the prices and the rates we ultimately charge corporate America to the business. Tort reform comes and there's litigation finance where disclosure laws have to change around that and I mentioned that better. And some states require it, most don't. And it's very simple because it puts in context how sympathetic is the plaintiff. And what are the motives? There's laws around who bears liability, the responsibility, what they call joint and several laws around it. You could be 1% liable, but you're the only one with any money, so they make you 100% responsible financially.   There are reasons that, that occurs, but that is also being gamed by the trial bar in how they target cases and how they target companies. It's those sorts of things. The insurance industry is hardly sympathetic. Corporate America needs to do more in this case, and we are all active. A number of companies are active in advocating for reforms, but it's not a magic, it's no silver magic bullet. It's going to take many years and it's going to require more effort than is currently being expended. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGreat. Switching gears, maybe a quicker question on Personal Lines. If I look at kind of what Chubb has said about kind of loss cost inflation in personal lines and appreciating you have a different book than I guess the average of your peers. But you got -- you all have been talking about kind of close to double digit or double-digit loss cost inflation for many years now. It feels like that's been -- some of your peers have caught up to you in terms of, I think, they were underestimating it. But just curious if you can provide any context. Is the loss cost inflation more so coming from weather inflation? Or is it just as much coming from wage inflation? Or just any context unpacking that kind of 10%, 10.5% loss inflation? \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, it comes from 3 sources -- or a couple of sources. It comes from frequency of loss and from various perils. It comes from -- and so there you could think weather-related. You can also think water-related. And so the infrastructure impact to housing stock itself. It comes from wage inflation, and it comes from materials, which -- remember, we ensure not the average homeowner, we're ensuring those who are more affluent. And our product is a richer product in terms of how it responds to loss and the position it places you back in following loss. We try to duplicate exactly what you had before the loss, not sort of like it, but we duplicate it.   That has an inherent inflation to it as well. And we ensure more complex properties, and we ensure more complex and expensive content. So that may contribute to a degree to a greater amount of inflation than you might see generally across. But we stay on top of it. And we have and we've stayed on top of it in terms of both pricing and the amount of coverage we give to our clients. So they don't fall behind, which for all our homeowners, in shorts, that shows up, yes, in your bill that you get once a year from us, be included."

Greg, keep in mind, percentages are a funny thing. It's not a big business. It's not a big book of business. We're not a large reinsurer. So the percentage growth, which is very good to see, is off of a relatively small base. So in dollar terms, it's nice. Thank you very much to all our Global Re colleagues, but it's not a large amount. We allocated given the pricing environment and given structure and given underlying pricing and structure of cedent's portfolios. We allocated more -- incrementally, as I said in the opening, more CAT capacity with 2 Global Re, which means they're writing a bit more CAT excess and a bit more property proportional and excess per risk. And it's across the globe where they see favorable conditions. That's predominantly with the CAT results. \n\nCharles Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. Fair enough.

I mean, you featured it. You talked about the 1 to 2 points of drag you get on holding excess capital. You mentioned that in your shareholder letter. You're generating great results. I feel like this is a time where we could see you get more active in the market. But maybe you can just talk to us broadly about what you're seeing in the market? Is there a pipeline out there? Or is it -- is there a lot of opportunities? Or give us some perspective if possible. \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGreg, I'm at rest. And the results are terrific. We have excess capital for both risk and opportunity. It's earning -- putting money to work at over 6% right now. If you put the capital against our invested asset, it requires certainly a damn good ROE. The cash that we hold is accretive to shareholder returns. And look, we're a global company with a lot of global opportunity and our eyes are always open. But as I said, I'm at rest. Don't hold your breath."

Now that's obviously like a pretty broad set of various lines within financials. I think I heard you say that you're shrinking in mid-market, too. And my perception is that, it was a little bit more disciplined than some of the major accounts. So just curious if you could just take us within financial lines, whether it's account size or D&O excess whatever, like where are folks acting more or less irrationally? \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, look, the way to think about this -- don't just think, it behaves differently to a degree in major account than it does in middle market in the cohorts that show up where market competition is irrational. I'm not going to unpack each one of those. But what I'll break down for you is this. You have publicly traded D&O. And whether it's in middle market or it's in large account, there is dumb behavior depending on the cohort. I'm not going to unpack which one of them it is that much transparency, but you see it in large accounts and you see it in publicly traded deal. There is not-for-profit D&O. We write it in both major accounts and we write it in middle market.  And by the way, we write it in E&S. And there are cohorts where market, we know because we're the largest writers of this business. We know what the experience is, what the real exposures are, where losses are coming from, market and pockets of that important buckets irrational, dumb. Employment practices liability. Again, I'm going to say which cohorts, but market is -- many are very naive and don't understand the trends and the exposures that are driving EPLI and where it's being driven, what states, where law has changed. Is it around? It's not simply wage an hour, now technology impacts it. There are those who have no idea what's catching up to them.   And then you have legal changes that are occurring at the federal level that are impacting financial lines. You can see it and it's coming. So the good news about the business is, claims made reveals its secrets pretty quickly that will occur and it is a big company. We got a lot of opportunity in a lot of places. And in some of those areas, we're just not going to follow people off the cliff. It doesn't matter. \n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous):\nGot you. And a follow-up, just shifting gears. Just curious about priorities in U.S. personal lines. It kind of felt like you had the stuff in California a few years ago that in the past few years, it's sort of been more of a business where you've been focused more on risk selection and growth for good reason. But I mean it looks like it's more than $1 billion of underwriting earnings today. It looks a little underwritten. Just maybe if you could update us on -- yes, like what are the key sets of priorities in terms of managing that business right now? \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, key sense of priorities, good question. On one hand, we can continue pushing the envelope and we're impatient about it. On the -- how we define the services and coverage is that a customer in our space are to expect from a great carrier. The kind of resiliency services and engineering services, the kinds of technology that we can use to interface with our customers, give them a better experience. How we can use technology and claims and manage a better and more seamless outcome for them. All of that is wrapped up in how we think about that part of the business.   Our clients are CAT exposed. They were in a world where they choose to live where they live and know and make the choice to live where they're more CAT exposed. They will share more risk with us, but we can help them manage that risk on the portion that they share and as well reduce the exposure to loss on the portion we take. It also is allowing us, as we're doing that both through admitted and non-admitted to, in a sense, manufacture, more CAT capacity, which is really part of the ability or fuel to take on more exposure. We have a finite balance sheet. We can't take infinite risk. So we think about it in that regard.  Our pricing and the rate against exposure from perils continues to improve. We can keep pushing the envelope on how granular we become in terms of risk rating, more cohorts of risk to apply rate and price against. And we're continuing to do that, but we're restless about that. We can be even better at it. That allows us to provide more coverage in areas, think about it, like flood, where we have areas where we're actually leaning in to offer more protection to clients, but be able to manage the portfolio. Maybe that gives you a few."

But I'm seeing you're asking in a very theoretical way. There's something neat in what is a market, so it's always inherently messy. But when typically, when rate and price are adequate or in excess of what's required to earn a reasonable return then the market in time notices and responds and becomes more competitive. And at that time, rate and price stay steady with loss cost. And then the market begins to go soft. And when that part of the cycle happens, it means the rate on price are less than loss cost. And that is not terrible until rate and price versus loss cost is not enough to achieve a reasonable return on capital. \n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nAnd maybe just a follow up on that. Curious if you think that with data and analytics, these cycles are becoming less volatile over time. \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIn some areas, yes. Some areas, absolutely not. Because the loss cost environment, which data and analytics cannot [Technical Difficulty] is not less volatile. When the loss cost environment is more specific i.e., loss cost inflation, then with data and analytics in steady periods like that, then the amplitude of cycles is different."

So we expected that the trend doesn't change, but the reporting pattern changes. So therefore, if you really want to look at it in a correct way, you'd say, it went down during COVID to reaccelerate after COVID and then the expected cohorts of claims in aggregate still appear, and that's what we've seen.

And to the extent you can quantify the expected tax rate. \n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nFor next year and after, it's just too early to say. There's too many moving parts in terms of how the different countries are going to adopt and we're looking at it closely, but it's just too early to say."

Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, what I said, Elyse, thank you, is the premium growth because we don't really disclose exposure, but the premium growth came from, a substantial portion of it came from rate and price, which were very healthy across the portfolio. Property grew nicely. Property was our biggest growth area. Casualty grew, particularly in our middle market area and E&S. And rate and price had a substantial contribution to the growth, though we also grew new business where pricing versus loss cost is healthy to us. \n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my follow-up, you highlighted some planned reunderwriting within North America commercial. I believe you had also told us about that last quarter, and it sounds like we'll have that work through for the next couple of quarters. So is it right way to think about, I guess, the growth in North America commercial ex the LPT and just the reunderwriting as kind of the baseline of growth for the year. I know you don't like to guide, but you seem pretty positive about just casualty pricing and things like that, just trying to pull it all together. \n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI'm not going to help you with your worksheet, I'm sorry, Elyse. I don't guide. We don't guide growth for the year. What we did tell you is excluding the LPT, excluding the unusual size of the LPT because we have LPTs virtually every quarter. But excluding the unusual size of it, and what we view as the unusual, the onetime underwriting action in large account that I described, the net of that, we gave you a growth rate, and we said that's the underlying growth rate for that quarter. That is not -- we didn't say that's a run rate for the year. This is a diversified commercial and personal property casualty book of business. And you're hardly -- we don't give guidance on growth for the year."

Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our June 30, 2024, second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another great quarter. We produced core operating EPS of $5.38, up 9.3%. Premium revenue growth reflects strong results in our businesses around the world. North America P&C, International P&C and Life Insurance demonstrates the broad-based diversified strength of our company. Our underwriting results were simply excellent. We published a combined ratio of 86.8%. We grew investment income more than 25%. Life segment income was up 8.7%, with International Life up double-digit. Core operating income for the quarter was $2.2 billion, bringing year-to-date operating earnings to $4.4 billion, up 13.5% and a record six-month result. P&C underwriting income in quarter of $1.4 billion was essentially flat as a result of higher cat losses globally. As you know, it was an active quarter for the industry. Our losses of $580 million compared with $400 million prior year, and they were in line with our modeled expectations, while last year's second quarter losses were light. On an ex-cat current accident year basis, underwriting income of $1.8 billion was up over 11% with a combined ratio of 83.2%, both were record underwriting results. Investment income topped $1.5 billion, up nearly 26% and a record as well. At June 30, our reinvestment rate is averaging 5.9% and our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9% versus 4.5% a year ago. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates. Our invested asset now stands at $141 billion and we expect it to continue growing. Life segment income of $276 million was right in line with our plan. Our annualized core operating ROE for the quarter was 13.3%, with a return on tangible equity of over 21%. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to other matters, growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased 11.8% in the quarter or 12.3% in constant dollars. We are a large diversified global insurer and our growth this quarter is again a reflection of who we are. Growth was broad-based geographically by product and customer segment, both commercial and consumer, from North America commercial to North America consumer, international commercial, Asia, Europe and Latin America to international consumer, particularly Asia and Latin America. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions remain favorable in both property, which is naturally more competitive, and casualty, which is firming in those classes that require rate. Loss-cost inflation remains steady within what we have contemplated in our pricing and our reserving. Property has become more competitive as more capital is entered. Our book is well priced, and terms and conditions remain steady. Casualty is firming in the areas that need rate, and we see this trend in casualty enduring, and I'm going to give you some more color by division. So, let's start with North America. Premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 8% and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal lines and 6.7% growth in commercial, with all P&C lines, including comp, up 8.7%, and financial lines down about 3%. We wrote over $1.3 billion of new business, which is a record, and our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90%, both speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 6.5%, with P&C up about 8% and financial lines down 2.5%. Our E&S business grew about 8.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7.5%, with P&C lines up almost 11% and financial lines down 4.5%. Again, the underwriting environment in North America is generally favorable and rational, financial lines aside. P&C pricing, excluding financial lines and comp, was up 8.3%, with rates up 5.5% and exposure change of 2.7%. Financial lines pricing was down 3.2%, with rates down about 3.5% and exposure up 0.3%. In workers' comp, which includes both primary and large account risk management comp, pricing was up 4.2%, with rates up 1.6% and exposure up 2.6%. And breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 5.3%, with rates up about 1.1% and exposure change of 4.2%. Large accounts shared and layered in E&S property pricing was flat to down, while in the middle market, rates continue to rise, about 7%. We are big in all three, and again all three are priced adequately. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.7%, with rates up 9.9% and exposure up 1.6%. Loss-costs in North America remain stable, in line -- and in line with what we contemplate in our loss picks. Loss-costs for P&C, excluding financial lines and comp, are trending at 7.3%, with short-tail classes up 5.3%, and casualty, excluding comp, at 8.6%. We are trending our first dollar work comp book at 4.6%. As I said, when it comes to financial lines, the underwriting environment in a number of classes is simply not smart. We are trading growth for a reasonable underwriting margin. We are trending financial lines loss-costs at just over 5%. On the consumer side of North America, our high net-worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter, with premium growth of over 12%, including new business growth of 30%. Premium growth for our true high net-worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known, for grew 17%. These numbers are really impressive. When you consider our high net-worth personal lines division, it's almost a $7 billion business. Our homeowners pricing was up 14.6% in the quarter, while the loss-cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. Turning to our International General Insurance operations, net premiums were up over 16.5% in constant dollar. Our International commercial business grew nearly 14%, while consumer was up almost 21%. Asia Pacific led the way with premiums up 36%, and excluding China's contribution, premiums were up over 9%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 12%, and Europe retail grew over 9%, with the continent up 11%. 41% of our Overseas General division's premium is consumer, both A&H and personal lines, and it's growing at a good"

In the quarter, premiums in our International A&H business were up over 10.5%, led by Asia Pacific and Europe. Our International personal lines business had another excellent quarter, with growth of 32%, led by Asia Pac and Latin America. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our International commercial portfolio, with retail, property and casualty lines pricing up 6.1% and financial lines pricing down 4.1%. Loss-cost inflation across our International retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8% with P&C lines trending 6.1% and financial lines trending 4.8%. In our International Life Insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 31.7% in constant dollar. Excluding China, life premiums were up almost 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency, brokerage, bank assurance and direct marketing distribution channels. International Life earnings grew over 15% in the quarter in constant dollar. Lastly, Global Re had a strong quarter with premium growth exceeding 40% and a combined ratio of 72.7%. Growth was property-driven, both risk and cat. And in the quarter, we wrote more one-off structured transactions, which contributed to our growth. In summary, as you could see, we had a great quarter, and again, our results reflect the strength, the breadth and the depth globally of the company. We are confident in our ability to continue growing our operating earnings at a superior rate through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and life income. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter and we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you know, our balance sheet and overall financial position are very strong and just got stronger, benefiting from our first half results. Our underwriting and investment results continue to generate substantial capital and significant positive cash flow. Our book value reached over $61 billion or $151 per share, and adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter and through six months were $3.6 billion and a record $7.2 billion, respectively. We returned $939 million of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $570 million in share repurchases and $369 million in dividends, and $1.6 billion in total through six months. [indiscernible] tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.6% and 3.1%, respectively, for the quarter, and 4.9% and 6.1%, respectively, year-to-date, benefiting from core operating income partially offset by capital return to shareholders noted earlier. In addition, we closed on two small acquisitions this quarter Healthy Paws, a pet insurance business, and Catalyst Aviation, which together diluted tangible book value by about $300 million. Core operating ROE and return on tangible equity were 13.3% and 21.1%, respectively, for the quarter, and 13.6% and a record 21.6%, respectively, year-to-date. Turning to investments, our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.56 billion, which included approximately $30 million of higher-than-normal income from private equity and other areas. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to average approximately $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion for the remainder of the year. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $580 million, which were principally from weather-related events, with 75% in the US and 25% internationally. Prior-period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $285 million pre-tax, with $144 million in North America Commercial, $64 million in North America Personal, $61 million in Overseas General and $16 million in Global Retail. The $285 million was split 35% long-tail lines predominantly in North America Commercial and 65% in short-tail lines. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $93 million, mostly coming from molestations-related claims development. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 71% and 77% year-to-date. Our core effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which is within our guided range. We continue to expect our core effective tax rate to be within 18.75% to 19.25% for the remainder of this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. We'll be happy to take your questions."

Most of the focus, as you know, and you guys -- you gave good commentary, Evan, as you usually do on loss-cost trends. I'm trying my best to use the live transcript to true up some of the quarter-over-quarters, but I believe you made commentary about loss-cost trend in North America, specifically being stable and kind of in-line with your expectations, but I think you said there was a -- it was, excluding comp, in the 8%s, and I believe last quarter was in the 7%s. So just curious, is loss-cost trend changing a bit in terms of the trend line?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, there wasn't a change of loss-cost, and frankly, it was 7.3%, is what I said for P&C lines, which excludes financial lines and comp. I think that's the way to look at it. And the 8% was pricing, was up 8.3%. Pricing exceeded loss-costs P&C lines. As we...\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nWould you say -- got it. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. So, just sticking with that and I guess this will just be my follow-up, there's a number of indices out there which kind of show that pricing in certain parts of the marketplace, even ex-financial lines are sub-6%, sub-5%. Would you say that -- I know you've talked about not accepting all business, that's not priced adequately. Would you say that Chubb's kind of in a doing that more so today in terms of kind of saying no to more business than it usually does in order to kind of make sure you're keeping pricing above loss-cost trend, whereas maybe others don't appear to be doing that when we see their trend lines on their loss ratios?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, I think I understood what you just said. Let me answer this. We wrote $1.3 billion of new business. That's a record. We grew in our P&C business 8% or so, and we gave comps separately, gave financial lines separate. The market overall, those numbers, as I said, I'm repeating myself, speak to the tone of the market, which is overall quite good. We published a combined ratio of 86.8% with higher cats and 83.2% current accident year combined ratio. I'm hardly wringing my hands. Our results are outstanding underwriting results. The pricing in the market is reasonably rational, financial lines aside to me. Good areas -- and we're only writing business where we can earn an underwriting profit, and in all classes, we strive to earn an underwriting profit that reflects a good return on capital that we're deploying against that line of business. In some classes, they're well priced and getting rate that equals loss-cost, brilliant. In some classes, there is pricing below loss-cost, because the margins are so decent. And in other classes and they're casualty-related, we're writing the business because we're getting rate while in excess of loss-cost as those lines approach their adequacy. I hope that answers your question.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Given the good pricing you're still seeing in [casualty] (ph) lines right now, I'm just a little surprised that we aren't seeing more growth in that area from y'all.

Maybe correct me if there's something else going on that I'm just not seeing in the numbers.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. We're growing property, and the unit count grew well.

Apologies.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, casualty is growing, and it's growing in the areas that we think we should be growing. And then, we have some areas, remember, in large account where we have been restructuring, in troubled classes and increasing retentions and we have accounts we've gotten off of or who have left us because of change of terms and all of that, it was worth about $50 million in the quarter. And that will run its string. It's particularly auto liability related. And -- but other than that, certain classes grew, some stayed flat, but overall casualty was up.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. Thank you. And then, Evan, just second question, and I appreciate all the color on loss trend and stuff, but given some of the uncertainty that others in the industry are talking about on what's going on in the social inflation environment, are you all kind of thinking about maybe or are adding some additional IBNR to perhaps loss picks and stuff, or are we not at that point of this right now?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThat's a strange way of framing for me. You're either raising your loss pick, which is IBNR, it's IBNR in casualty, generally you're -- if it's on a more recent year, it's all IBNR. If it's case -- if it's due to case reserve on recent years, then hang on to your hat. And if you're -- whereas on older, older years, you could be raising your loss pick based on the actual incurred claim. So, to me, it's just simply another way of saying are you raising your loss picks on more recent years. We already have raised our loss picks. It's already been baked into our business as we've gone along, and we've raised our loss-cost trends and we take rate against loss-cost and on a written basis and then to earn through, we pick -- we've been picking higher loss ratios over the last few years. And that's just steady. We haven't adjusted our loss picks this year for what we see in loss-cost trends. The loss-cost trends, as I said, remain steady with what we have contemplated. Now, as you do reserve studies, there are individual classes where if you're taking reserve charge, you're taking reserve charge because that, by its nature, means you're raising the loss picks, which includes IBNR on a cohort of years. It may be that you're raising it just because of development you see on older years, it may be that you see that flowing through to more -- to change your view in more recent years and in which case you raise them, but that's study by study. I hope that answers your question.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):"

You grew in pretty incredible 42% premium year-to-date. Can you maybe talk about the driver of this growth in North America personal? And also, how should we think about just the growth trajectory of this line going forward? I understand, obviously, homeowner and auto is going to be very different, but just curious your thoughts going forward.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nDid you -- we did not grow North America personal lines 42% year-to-date, but we've grown it double-digit year-to-date. And so just -- so we level set between each other, the line is growing at a very healthy rate. And look, it's for -- there's a combination of reasons. It's broad-based growth. We're not growing simply in -- okay, cat-exposed stressed areas. We're growing where high net-worth customers have homes. And so that would of course have a strong cat-exposed element to it, but we're growing at a broad variety of geographies across the United States. We're getting improved rate to exposure. Our pricing -- and we've worked on it for years now, our ability to price the business is far more sophisticated and our by-peril pricing is very sophisticated. The services we provide and the richness of the coverage, if you are a customer whose profile meets our product, we're who you want, because the richness of the coverage and the way we administer it, that's what our brand is well known about. And there is a real increase in demand for Chubb. We are not the cheap guys on the street. And in fact, there are many who I personally will tell them, if you're looking for a cheaper price, let me give you the name of three other insurance companies. But no, they want Chubb and the renewal retention rate and the growth in new business, it's very gratifying that way. And we're improving our services and constantly improving our services and in the way we communicate with our customer. And that is in front of us. We can continue improving this and improve the -- which is the competitive profile of the product area. So -- and then, yes, in cat-exposed areas, we're getting well paid for the business we're writing. I don't mind saying we're reshaping and have been shaping in cat-exposed areas to a healthier portfolio in terms of the quality of risk and whether they're just given us cat business or they're giving us a broad base of business beyond cat exposure. And we're shaping that portfolio and getting priced reasonably for it and we're purchasing enough protection to protect the balance sheet as we grow accumulations. So, all in all, our personal lines business is in a very healthy place.\n\nBob Huang - Equity Research Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGreat. Thank you. Yeah, the 42%, personal auto, I misspoke there. Yeah. So, the second question is, in the press release, you talked about, you're seeing a broad set of opportunities in accident and health and personal lines across the globe, right? Can you maybe expand on where you think that opportunity resides? It feels like your European business is doing well. Your Asia business is doing well. Is this globe -- are you referring to more broadly speaking, or is it more Southeast Asia, South Asia? Can you maybe give us a little bit more details there? Is it more organic, inorganic, things of that nature?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nLove the question. Thank you. Okay. So, let's take accident and health. The combined insurance company in North America, which I'm going to start talking about more soon, but we've been a little quieter about it. It is growing at double-digits. It is a worksite voluntary benefits business and it is growing at a very healthy double-digit clip, and that is traditional -- our traditional accident and health. We're growing it for small-account companies and middle- and large-account companies, one through brokerage, one through agency. Our accident and health business in Asia Pacific has grown because we're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia for sure and maybe the world. It's over a $4.5 billion portfolio. And our direct marketed A&H business growing in Korea, growing through Southeast Asia is an excellent contributor. Our digital distributed consumer lines business, A&H and personal lines with over 200 digital platforms from the grabs of Southeast Asia to the new banks of Latin America for -- in what we call embedded or in path selling for accident and health and simple consumer products, think householders, think term life insurance, think device coverage for protecting devices, is growing at a -- that's our digital business, growing at a very healthy double-digit clip. Travel insurance in Asia growing well. In Europe, employer, employee and direct marketed A&H growing very well. I could go on and on, but that's a flavor of how it's -- maybe giving you a sense granularly of how it is across the globe.\n\nBob Huang - Equity Research Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nReally appreciate that. So, I think we'll look forward to more commentary down the road about this. Thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):"

We haven't changed it.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful clarification on that front. I guess, we've obviously heard a lot of noise this quarter from just across the industry on more recent accident year casualty reserves. Doesn't sound like there's been any big shifts in the claims environment just based on what you guys have done, but I'm wondering if you might just give some of your observations in terms of how we should be thinking about just the loss environment as the claims environment sort of normalizes following COVID.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah. Look, let me observe this way to you. On the loss side of it, we have been talking for many quarters for years now about the inflation in the casualty loss-cost environment. I won't go into all the reasons, but the litigation. We have talked about the reasons and we have talked about some of the areas, whether it is excess casualty related, auto liability related. And that's just not new noise or new facts. That's been for a long time we've been talking. We've talked about how inflation in that area has accelerated over a period of time. We talked about how the court system was closed down and how you had to be careful in not taking the head fake and continuing to trend up. We've talked about how companies have managed this and some have been quicker, some have been slower to recognize development. Though everyone is in the boat of struggling to stay on top of it, some have reacted more quickly and their recognition in reserves and loss picks than others. So again, everyone struggles to stay on top. We've talked about how reinsurers are late -- are the latest to the party. And those who may not have as good a data set or be as activist and intrusive in how they use data and interpret it for management information, all of that rolls together to make the soup everyone is obsessed about at this moment about casualty, and I understand it. I say it that way, because when it comes to Chubb, we have almost $65 billion of loss reserves, very broad-based. We study them all on an annual basis, and we watch them all on a monthly and quarterly basis. There's always something developing well and something not developing as well as you imagine. It's never a precise science. On balance, our reserves are as strong. And frankly, we said this at December and I can tell you as of June 30, our loss reserves are stronger than they were in December in aggregate when we look at them today. And that is with staying on top of the positive development in casualty, i.e. comp and other areas and the negative development that is occurring in auto liability and access and umbrella, et cetera. David, I hope that's as much as I can say on the subject.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nI really appreciate it.

So, I think you've been running at a low 80%s underlying, combined mid-80%s reported in recent years, including year-to-date. That's a whopping improvement relative to where it's been historically, right, 5 points to 10 points better I think. So, how do you think about the balance of protecting these margins and risk-adjusted returns on the one hand and pursuing growth on the other in the context of maybe elevated market uncertainty, but these terrific margins?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, let's see. I think it speaks for itself. We grew at a pretty healthy clip when you look at it. Our middle market P&C business grew at 11%. Our E&S business grew at 8.7%. Our large-account business grew a little slower clip. Our financial line shrank, while P&C grew. I've gone through that where rates achieve a risk-adjusted return from everything we can tell, that we contemplate achieving, we're growing that business as fast as we can. Where it's not achieving it, we're striving to achieve it. Where we can't earn an underwriting profit, we're shrinking. Where it's adequate, we're growing as fast as we can. And we have the capital, the depth of balance sheet and an appetite and knowledge and geographic reach and the distribution brand, the underwriting capability to grow in those areas where we want to grow. And there are times we'll trade rate for growth and we'll -- there are times we'll trade growth for rate. We're doing both. And when it comes to the current accident year combined ratio, I've said before and I've written this, it's very interesting about the industry's current accident year combined ratio ex-cat. Property is a much larger part and a growing -- everybody is more cat-levered because of the changes in the [reinsurance] (ph) market, the rates and terms. And we take the cat loss out of the numerator, but in the denominator, we leave all the premium, that naturally drives down our current accident year combined ratio in mix of business all else being equal. So, it's -- I look -- that's a part and parcel of the published combined ratio, which is the primary number that everyone should look at. And the current accident year to look through volatility is a secondary indicator. And that's how I think of about. And I think what we published of an 86.8%, which has higher cat losses than prior quarter -- prior year's quarter because volatility in property is simply an outstanding number. I hope that answers your question. This is a company with big appetite and -- but a big appetite and an ambition to grow when we can earn a reasonable return.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. And maybe to follow -- sorry, go ahead.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, I'm done.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nSo, maybe to follow-up on that. So, in lines where you are getting rate in excess of trend, is it reasonable to think of an acceleration of growth in those -- premium growth in those lines? So essentially policies in-force increasing or accelerating at a faster pace?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThere is. We've met -- you can't see it, and we're not going to disclose anything like that. But it is apparent to us, again, we wrote $1.3 billion of new business, a record. And we had a renewal retention rate policy cap of 90%. I rest my case.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):"

Just sort of curious, if there were any notable movements within that, including long-tail casualty versus workers' comp?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah, sure. We studied large-account comp this quarter, and we studied auto liability across the organization, large, medium, small, all added together. Among other casualty lines, that we studied a variety of GL, general liability-related ones, comp produced about $287 million release and the auto liability studies produced about $116 million of charge and not concentrated in any one year spread out. And that was the major piece.\n\nMike Ward - Equity Research Analyst (Citi):\nOkay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Evan. And then maybe kind of on a similar theme, but I saw some media sort of reporting on, an executive that you hired specifically to handle inflated jury verdicts. Just wondering if you could expand on that role and how you expect the industry to actually...\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah. He's not going to handle inflated jury verdicts. That sounds like I hired somebody out of the mafia, because I don't know any other way except with a mask and a gun. But what he's -- what we're focused on is the litigation environment and what we can do to help galvanize and lead in that lead efforts among corporate America to pool our influence and our resources to impact the litigation environment, which is going to be impacted through the political arena and the regulatory arena. You going to get some laws changed, and it's a state by state when you get down to the critical issues, whether you're talking mass tort or you're talking individual large awards or you're talking litigation funding, any of that. And so, we're going to double down on focusing on that to work with corporate America that is waking up and becoming more energized about this. And I will in the future, I'm sure have more to say about it. And right now, we'll just go to work on it.\n\nMike Ward - Equity Research Analyst (Citi):"

In the last 90 days, it seems like there's been a flurry of announcements from the company on management changes and promotions. And I'm curious, Evan, if you could just step back, give us a snapshot of what's going on behind the curtain.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSure. Behind the curtain? No curtain. What an energizing thing for this organization. These -- we have a very well-oiled and effective succession management and key employee process. We've been engaged in for over 18 years. And at my level, it involves keeping our eye on about 500 people across the company. The people who were promoted and the change of responsibilities is a reflection of that succession management process. This was -- these changes were planned over 18 months ago. The individuals, [John Keogh] (ph), and we had planned it. John Lupica, and we had planned for it. It's very orderly. It was individuals who've had long history with the company. They're of our culture. They have the talent, the capability to do more. The company, to state the obvious, look at the size and scale of it, it's growing. And therefore, the structure has to adapt and the talent that you put in place has to reflect the opportunity set and all of the dynamics around management of the organization that you need to address all at once. We have bigger strategic issues that have to do with opportunities and we just talked about litigation. These massive structural things in front of us that Chubb is a leader, as it has a responsibility and an opportunity, participate in, and we need leadership that can address that. All the day to day of our business and managing the day to day of our business grows more complicated and is more diverse. And so, part of my job is to reflect on all of that and to use the succession process we have that produces a deep, well-diversified bench of talent to match up against all of that. And that's what it reflects. And what's so great is everyone who was on that -- those announcements know each other well, have been together well for a long time, and it just -- it means the team just gets stronger.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nGreat. I'm going to, for my follow-up question, get out of the North American commercial liability reserve sandbox and jump into the agricultural business. I was watching -- I think I checked...\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think we dug all for the sand out of that box. So, I'm like, I'm done, but go ahead.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nI figured. It's exhausting.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI'm so known for my patients.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nYou handled yourself very well, so congratulations on that. For -- I checked the spot rate of a bushel of corn, looks like it's down, what, some 30% year-over-year. So, not that that's an arbiter of the outlook for your agricultural business, but maybe if you could give us an update on how this year looks to be shaping up? Obviously, I know the harvest season is still emerging, but any color there would be helpful.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYeah. I'm going to be very careful because I'm not going to jinx myself in the middle of the game. But where we have concentration of exposure, it is a very good growing season so far, particularly for corn and soybean. We have a well-diversified book. We're heavier, and we've always been west of the Mississippi, but in a very broad swath of geography, Midwest, upper Midwest, in particular. And the growing conditions are very good. When you see spot markets at this moment and it just -- it's not something to obsess about or look at really because it reflects what people were imagining. It's a speculative class and they're imagining what the -- what's the government going to say about growing and they're all out there looking at the years of corn on -- counting the years on stocks right now. And that's what's driving price at the moment. We'll see how it pans out, but right now, it's shaping up well.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):"

You may begin.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you and welcome everyone to our September 30, 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement which are available on our website@investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings Press release and financial supplements. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team and now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you've seen, we had another really great quarter with strong double digit growth in both P&C underwriting and investment income leading to core operating EPS growth of over 15.5%. Global P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 7.6% or 8.5% in constant dollars, which is the clearer way to view intrinsic growth and once again reflected the broad and diversified nature of our company and the opportunities we're capitalizing on around the world with strong contributions from our North America P&C International, P&C and life insurance businesses. Core operating income for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 14.3%. Earnings for the year are currently at record levels with net and operating income up 16.9% and 13.8% respectively. The three sources of earnings growth, P&C underwriting, investment income and life income each delivered a strong result. Our published combined ratio for the quarter was 87.7% with P&C underwriting income of 1.5 billion up over 11.5% despite an active quarter for the industry globally in terms of natural catastrophes, hurricanes, floods, fires, tornadoes and other severe convective storm activity. On an ex-cat current accident year basis, a secondary measure of underwriting, we produced record underwriting income of $2 billion up 11.5% with a combined ratio of 83.4%. For the year, we have produced record underwriting income on both a published and current accident year basis. As a company in the business of risk, we pride ourselves on being world class underwriters. It's who we are. We're also asset managers with an excellent long-term record of invested asset allocation and risk adjusted returns. Our invested asset now stands at 151 billion and it will continue to grow as a consequence of our basic business of insurance. For the quarter, adjusted net investment income topped 1.6 billion up 15.9%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9 versus 4.7 a year ago and our current new money rate is averaging 5.5%. In our judgment, given the broad based health of the U.S. economy and the pattern of inflation when one reads past the headlines, the Fed will likely take a reasonably cautious approach to lowering rates. Given the size and continued growth of our federal deficit, which is simply unsustainable, we believe the yield curve will steepen and that too will support our future reinvestment rate. We remain confident in our ability to reinvest our cash flows at rates that will continue to accrete to the overall portfolio yield. Life insurance segment income of $284 million was ahead of plan and while you know it's our policy to generally refrain from guidance, we are well on pace to exceed our life division income target of a billion for the year. Our annualized core operating ROE for the quarter was 13.9% with a return on tangible equity of 21.7. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment, Global P&C net premiums, which excludes agriculture increased 7.6 in the quarter were again 8.5 in constant dollar with commercial premiums up 8.1% and consumer up 9.4%. Again, growth was global and broad based geographically by product and customer segment. North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America all contributed favorably. Life premiums grew 10.6% in constant dollar with growth of 10 in international life and 15 in combined North America. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market trends were consistent with those of the previous quarter. Overall conditions are favorable in both property which is incrementally more competitive in certain areas and casualty which is incrementally firmer. Loss cost inflation remains steady and within what we have contemplated in our pricing and reserving pricing for both remains ahead of loss costs. Property has become more competitive in the large account and EMS segments while middle market property pricing was in fact up over prior quarter are large in all three segments of the market. Our property book is well priced and terms and conditions remain steady. As with prior quarter casualty is firming in the areas that need rate and we see this trend in casualty enduring. Overall, our casualty rate and price were up over prior quarter. Let me give you a little more color by division. Beginning with North America premiums excluding agriculture were up 7.8% and consisted of 10% growth in personal insurance and 7.2 in commercial with P&C lines up nearly 10% and financial lines down about 5%. We wrote more than $1.2 billion of new business up over 18% versus prior year and our renewal retention rate on a policy count basis is 89.6%. Again, both speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market, the power of Chubb and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 7.2 with P&C up 9.5% and financial lines down over 6%. Within major and specialty, our E&S business grew 11% with strong contributions for both property and casualty related lines. Premium in our middle market division increased just under 7% with P&C up 10.7% and financial lines down 5.7. Again, the underwriting environment in North America is generally favorable and rational. Financial lines aside, pricing for property and casualty excluding financial lines and workers comp was up 9.9% with rates up 8% and exposure change of 1.8 again with both rates and pricing up from second quarter. Financial alliance pricing was down 3.2% with rates down about 3.4%. In workers comp which includes both primary and large account risk management pricing was up 4.2% with rates up 1.4 and exposure up 2.8. Breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 6.7% with rate of 3.7% and exposure change of 2.9%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.7% well in excess of loss costs with rates up 11.9% and exposure 0.7%. Our loss cost in North America again remains stable, no change and in line with what we contemplate in our loss events. In agriculture, where we are the market leader, we gained increased market share and wrote more policies insuring more farmers and fields. Though premiums were down from prior year primarily due to lower commodity prices than last year. Commodity prices are used to price the premiums we charge farmers. Far more importantly, our crop underwriting results this quar"

Far more importantly, our crop underwriting results this quarter were excellent and from everything we know now, 24 is shaping up to be a very good underwriting year. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter with premium growth of 10% including new business growth exceeding 25%. Premium growth for our true high net worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we're known for was 16.8%. Our homeowners pricing was up 13.7% in the quarter and ahead of loss cost trend which remained steady. Turning to our international general insurance operations, it was a decent quarter. Net Premiums were up 4.9% or 7.5% in constant dollars. Our international commercial business grew 6.7% while consumer was up 8.5%. Asia Pacific led the way with premiums up 9.2%. Latin America grew over 7.5% while Europe grew over 7% with the continent of Europe up 8.7%. Premiums in our international retail commercial P&C business were 6.5% in constant dollar. P&C lines were up almost 11% and financial lines were down 10%. It is worth noting adjusting for a one time premium benefit we received in the third quarter of last year underlying growth was over 14% in P&C lines internationally with financial lines down 3.8%. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our international retail commercial portfolio with P&C lines pricing up 6.3% and financial lines pricing down 3.5%. Premiums in our international wholesale business grew about 8% in constant dollar. As is typical, the London wholesale market is growing more competitive and frankly for me is exhibiting classic London underwriter and broker behavior. Generally speaking, underwriting prosperity likely won't endure over time and London will underperform in due course. Except for those few real underwriters who know how to manage what is simply a trade. I have seen this movie many times. Our international personal lines business had an excellent quarter with growth of 12.7% led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. And our global reinsurance business had a strong quarter. Premiums were up about 35%. We had a combined ratio of 94.4% which included a more active cat loss quarter. Again, in our international life insurance business which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up about 21% in constant dollar. International life earnings grew over 9% in the quarter in constant dollar. So that's a lot of news and in summary we had another excellent quarter and having a record earnings year. While we're in the risk business and volatility is a natural feature, we are very confident in our ability to continue growing our operating earnings and EPS at a superior rate. P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and life income. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter and then we're going to come back and take your question.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you have just heard from Evan, despite an elevated level of industry wide cats, we had another strong quarter that generated adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter and through nine months of $4.6 billion and a record $11.7 billion respectively. Our results further strengthened our overall financial position, ending the quarter with all-time highs in book value of nearly $66 billion and invested assets of $151 billion. On July 31st we issued $700 million of 5 year debt and $600 million of 10 year debt at an attractive weighted average cost of under 5%. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including a repayment of 700 million of euro denominated debt due in December. We returned $782 million of capital to capital shareholders this quarter including $413 million in share repurchases and $369 million in dividends and $2.4 billion in total. Through nine months, book and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.7% and 4.3% respectively for the quarter and 7.7% and 10.6% respectively year-to-date benefiting from core operating income partially offset by the capital returned to shareholders. Core operating ROE and return on tangible equity were 13.6% and a record 21.5% respectively year-to-date. Turning to investments, our A rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.64 billion which included approximately $40 million of higher than normal income from private equity. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $765 million of which $250 million was related to Hurricane Helene and the balance principally from weather related events split 70% in the U.S. and 30% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter interactive companies was a favorable $299 million pretax with favorable development of $358 million in short tail lines primarily from property and $59 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines which was primarily from general casualty. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $55 million primarily environmental liability related. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter and the year was 77%. Our core effective tax rate was 17.7% for the quarter which is below our previously guided range due to shifts in the mix of income as well as certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the quarter. We expect our fourth quarter core effective tax rate to now be between 19% and 19.25% [ph] with the full year between 18% and 18.25% [ph]. We expect to provide guidance on the 2025 tax rate as part of our fourth quarter earnings at the end of January. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. And at this point we're happy to take your questions."

So first question is on the North America commercial. I think if we like you said before, right. Pricing, Ex Financial Alliance, Ex Workers comp continue to be very strong over the last few quarters and you had really incredible margins in this business. Just given the pricing and the growth, should we expect growth to accelerate from here or how should we think about growth in this business? Ex Financial Alliance, Ex Workers comp going forward?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. First of all, we don't give forward guidance, as you know. So I'm not going to answer that in a specific way. You see the amount of new business we run, you see our retention rate. You see we're in a healthy market and we're in an underwriter's market. Risk selection, structure of risk, how you structure it and pricing matter. All underwriters aren't created equal. So we compete for business. And some areas of business have become more competitive, naturally. Speaking to property, I'm confident when I look forward at Chubb's ability to continue to grow above trend, when I look at longer term trend and as I look forward over a period of time, and I'll leave it at that.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGreat, thank you. Second question is on the international business. Apology in advance if I misinterpreted your commentary, but it sounded like what you're saying is that in London there could be more competition. Does that imply that a lot of the international growth going forward will be driven by Asia and elsewhere? If that is the case, does the upcoming election potentially have an impact on the growth in that area?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWow. First of all, our London wholesale business is proportionately is not the overwhelming part of our international business. It's about 10%. And so put that in perspective, 90% is our global retail international Europe grew eight and a half. Latin America grew seven and a half. Asia grew in the nines. So it's that vast territory. And then the U.K. itself rose well, and then which is U.K. retail, which is a big business. And then you have the London wholesale market, where business comes to London to get placed. And that's what my comment was referring to. The classic London market competition that I just thought I would call out because you start to see the behavior that is classic of London. The election, I'm not sure how you linked it to the election and the election outcome. You'd have to enlighten me, but does that help you?\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. No, no, I think it does. Really appreciate the U.K. comments there. Thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):"

What's your expectations if we go into 1:1 renewals both on the primary and reinsured side?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, on the primary side in the middle market, small commercial, which is really the vast majority of business in insurance in North America. Overall when you look at the industry, pricing remains firm and prices continue to go up and it's both hurricane and active SCS activity, modeled, non-modeled loss and the market needs the price and it continues to move in that direction. Would you get to shared and layered particularly whether it's large account or it's E&S related. That's where there is more -- the business is well priced but there is rate pressure. Rates are coming down though they remain at good levels and because there's more capital that's entered the market, more competition and again in particular I call out London behavior that is almost aberrant relative to everybody else. But it remains a robust market.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, thank you. And my second question Peter, you mentioned there was 59 million of call it general casualty adverse development in North America. What accident years was that coming from? And maybe break it down a little more. Was it GL commercial auto? What's driving some of that development?\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, it was 19 to 22 years and it was in the general casualty areas, the negative and look, we do a lot of studies in the third quarter of casualty in the U.S. and it was. There were puts and calls so that you really have a clearer view of it. There were a number of long tail classes in the quarter that had positive results and then there was in particular excess casualty that produced a negative result. So it's a, it's a kind of a mixed bag. It's not all in one direction and that is what all added up to the North America casualty reserve charge which was...\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nThanks, I appreciate it."

I think you know over the last several quarters you guys had called out some troubled classes in North America commercial that you guys were reworking. I think it was a $50 million drag last quarter. I know there was also some of that in 4Q23. Is that largely behind you at this point? Aside from just sort of the normal course managing the book where we should see continued acceleration in some of those commercial casualty lines.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWe have another quarter or two to go before we finish. We began fourth quarter last year in most of it. We have a part of it that we began really in first quarter. So we have, we had about another 50 or so million this quarter, and it'll continue into fourth and a little bit into first. But, in the grand scheme of the total premiums we write, it's just not that significant. And remember, it's not. It's a combination of, whether some business moves to others who just don't get it. But a lot of it is due to how we change terms and attempts. This is large account related comments. And then of course the excess areas are getting a lot of rate that help to ameliorate. So maybe that helps you with it.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYes, thanks. That's, that's helpful.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWhen you look at the broad nature of our business, I mean, let's just keep a perspective. We write 20 some odd billion of net premiums in North America. Personal lines is about 7 of that. So all the rest is commercial. Massive number two middle market player, a large E&S player, major agricultural writer, large major account writer. And so when you start hearing numbers like, that we're talking about this area in large account casualty, well, it's not unimportant relative to the business keep perspective. It's small.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nRight. No, that's fair. And I see the rate is also accelerating there in casualty, so that's good to see as well. Maybe just moving on the property side. The catastrophe losses over the last several years and in the third quarter, this third quarter, were definitely surprisingly low just given the mix shift to property that you guys have had over the last several years. I guess I'm wondering if just from your perspective, is this third quarter sort of in line with sort of a normal third quarter that you would expect? And I guess as you think about the mix of property and casualty business, is this sort of -- are you still comfortable shifting more to property? Or is that something where, just given the market dynamics, it should stabilize at this point?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, the cat losses were a bit lower in the quarter than we would have modeled than our modeling that we contemplated pricing would have produced. So in our annual expected, that to me is just lost volatility. We're in a business that in a risk business there's volatility and there's two sides to the volatility. There's a favorable side and an unfavorable side. Because your average expected loss that you divide into four quarters is just an average. It's just that. And it contemplates all return periods in the loss and in the pricing. So you know, that makes sense to me that I'd see volatility. You're not going to hit the number. You're either up or down from it. And number one, number two, we have, we have a lot of capital flexibility. I think we're good underwriters of the business. So our risk selection and portfolio construction and ensuring we have good pricing I think contributes to Chubb's overall results in a major way versus the industry. And we're going to write the business whether it is property or casualty. We have an appetite for the volatility. We are going to write the business wherever it is. If we understand it, we can price it, structure it and assume. And so we're continuing to lean into property, we're continuing to lean into cash and personal lines and all other areas where we see there is growth potential. And frankly, the most frustrating thing inside our own organization, we can't get after opportunity fast enough and execute efficiently enough for our own appetite and expectations.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

But that's also where the exposure growth has been less pronounced. I'm guessing that's because of the work you're doing on fixing the trouble classes that you referenced. So without asking for guidance here, but just based on the data, is it fair to think of a growing appetite for casualty coming through in results as the troubled lines are fixed?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI don't know where you're getting that picture, but I can tell you that our casualty lines are actually growing quickly. And I'm not going to give you a breakdown, but our casualty lines are actually growing quickly. And in North America, in the areas where we see decent pricing and I don't see much of an overhang of $50 billion, hardly much of an overhang. So I can't agree with you. Your line of logic and I have to leave you to think your own thoughts.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nI'm just referencing the exposure growth of 70 basis points you called out in casualty pricing in North America.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, you're missing it. That's not growth in premium. That's okay. I have a store, My store sold more goods this year than last year. It sold 1% more in goods. My theater sold 1% more tickets than last year. That's exposure growth and we rate off of that. That's how you get to price. You're confusing price and rate with growth in premium. Two different things. My unit growth of number of customers I wrote is totally different. Yaron, you got to go. Just learn those basics. Sorry.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. All right.

The top line growth on total Life and on international as you know and as I said was around 10% the income growth in international was just over 9% so pretty much tracking. The combined insurance business in the last half of last year, I called out in the fourth quarterly earnings call had a bit of a non-recurring or oversized item, so if you back that out the growth rate would be relatively consistent for all of life with International.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGreat thanks for the reminder on that. Appreciate that. The second question I had was on capital. Noted your comments around dividends and share repurchase in the third quarter. The results of your company are outstanding.

And look, the business in London, overall the market is profitable. But my real point was the kind of behavior I'm seeing them exhibit, the way they're trying to attract more capital to a finite amount of business. The behavior of the capital as I look at it and the guises that it's in it just sets the table for the same movie I've watched that will occur over a number of years many times.

But overall profitability seems pretty good when we look at overall ROEs across many of these businesses. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on price adequacy in general across some of those casualty lines and how much need is there for the industry in your view to keep pushing price and casualty.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, there is no general statement. It varies by area of casualty by customer, cohort by geography. There is no simple and that's why it's always an underwriter's market and you got to have the data, you got to have the experience and then you got to have the command and control to actually put them to work, and you got to have the analytics and actuarial to back it up. So there is no general statement that could put casualty which is a massive class of insurance in a neat box and on a bumper sticker.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nUnderstood. And sorry for the more broad based question it's just something I grapple with. Looking at the specific products versus like the overall profitability of companies. I honestly, I give it I'd help you out and give it to you. Understood. Next one I have is just on the asset base I guess is we're seeing I guess lower paid claims relative to incurred sort of an elongation of the claim cycle and casualty we're seeing asset bases kind of grow more than they otherwise would, which the good part about that is you get more net investment income potentially. I mean how should we think about the growth in the asset base?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think you just said something that you're going to have to think about how you connected those dots. You just said elongated payout pattern. And I don't relate to an elongated payout pattern. I do relate to strength of reserves that all things being equal paid to incurred can point to. And I do understand growth in business and in longer tail areas and mix in that regard. But I don't relate to a notion of elongated payout pattern generally speaking. And I don't know, I got the data, at least when it comes to Chubb.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nCan I. I mean the invested asset base growing at a pretty strong clip. I mean what's the underlying driver?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nOur business has been growing. And our margins have been good, and so our invested asset base, yes, continues to grow and our capital has been growing and that invested asset is a source of income and at superior returns on a risk adjusted well in excess of cost of capital. So that is a source of strength for the company. And we will continue to grow the invested asset on purpose and we will continue to focus on returns within that portfolio as a good asset allocator would, which is my earlier comments about us as an asset manager. We're a manager of capital and claim reserves. That's third party and that will continue to grow.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

Just thinking about the financial lines where premium was down 6.2% and I think you highlighted rate off low single digit but you still generated about a billion and a quarter of premium. So I'm wondering how much of that was D&O? Can you still make money in D&O and just how are you thinking about the outlook there?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI'm not going to give you a breakdown of how much was D&O, that's proprietary. But I am, what I will tell you is we're not writing the business if we can't make money, and we have a very large installed customer base. We have a long storied reputation in G&O and financial lines. We're a major brand in it. And when they're looking for someone to write their primary that is manage their risk, more often than not they want Chubb on that and the competition then is more in the excess layers. And yes, we're writing D&O because where we are, we're making.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nThat makes a lot of sense. And then just maybe to kind of follow on that London movie commentary that you gave. You're doing such exceptional underlying combined 80.8 in North America, 84.8. And overseas, Evan, could you see an environment where, it just gets more competitive globally and these excellent, these exceptional combines maybe erode a little bit. You still do great. But it's five years into the hard market already. Didn't we see?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nHere's what you're missing. You're looking at it on an ex-cat basis. When everyone is cat levered, look at published bind ratios. That's what tells you you can't chuck out the losses and leave the premium in the denominator. I reject that discussion because that's just not, that's just not understanding risk. And so what those ex cat look like and then ask yourself in and you have to do the work. But when you look at various companies, you look at various markets, you got to understand how much is cat levered, how much is not cat levered to get a real the health. And then that's why I continue to say published combined ratio is your most important indicator. And then after that a secondary indicator, all things being equal, is ex-cat. It tells you some things. But don't over read it.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nSo what I'm right, so what I should just simply read in is that the combines on an absolute basis are still very high for the industry and the outlook is good for Chubb.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThey're good. They're delivering good returns for the industry overall. And it varies by company. Some companies it's delivering good returns, some it's not. They're decent. There's not a lot of room to move. If you're thinking about pricing adequacy, it's not like industry ROEs are off the charts. They're decent, they're good on a risk adjusted basis. And then loss trend is relentless. Every year you have loss trend. See, you can't just stand still just to stay where you are. You got to get rate or price.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

And beyond that we're not giving detail.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay, thanks. And then you guys typically provide an investment income guide.

Any color you can provide there just relative to, fourth quarter and forward.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, Elyse, and last quarter I gave last six months guidance. So what I would say for the fourth quarter is we will be at the high end of that guidance for the fourth quarter on a recurring basis. Obviously there's things that are harder to predict. Like I spiked out the 40 million in the third quarter that was higher than normal on PE. But I'd say the high end of the guidance rate guidance level on a recurring basis for the fourth quarter.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then on tax you said you would give us right next year with Q4, but given, just Bermuda tax changes going into effect, just directionally, would that imply you guys would think the tax rate would be higher next year relative to this year's guide?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWe typically give the full year guidance in the fourth quarter.

Look, be careful. I didn't say exposure. Maybe we're using different terms. An exposure unit to me would be that I wrote more policies, I took more insureds. That doesn't go into price. We're only talking rate and price times exposure. And so we have rate and then we have a certain kind of exposure that equals price. And you apply it against units of exposure which is insured. And so the exposure part of price is just like rate. It acts like rate.

So casualty pricing has accelerated in recent quarters to approximately 12%. And as you state too, that's well above what most companies publicly stated their loss cost assumption. I guess I'm just trying to understand why pricing would be accelerating all the way up to 12, especially in today's higher interest rate environment, which is good for long tail lines. If loss costs are indeed below, then well below that number.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, so. Yes. So what I've been clear about, and that you're trying to be too simplistic, there are many cohorts of casualty, the majority significant. The vast majority of our portfolio is adequately priced. There are areas where price has had to accelerate to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return. It's those everyone's book of casualty is different. And our portfolio of casualty has produced these kinds of rate increases which were made up of just to keep pace with loss costs where we are adequately priced and greater levels of rate increase where we're pushing to achieve price adequacy and it all mixes together. And by the way, what's producing outstanding combined ratios. And that's as far as I can take it.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Okay, that's understood. Maybe just switching gears. Lastly, since you were willing to offer some color on your guidance on life insurance. So if the target this year was I guess a billion or so.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, Mike, it's not going to happen. I'm not giving you forward guidance. The only thing I was doing is because it was a year where it's the first year and I was just doing it for all of you because this was our first year where you didn't have noise of acquisitions and that in it. And you're trying to get it. Where are we relative to where we think we should be? That was why I gave a comment about the 2024 full year where our own target was, I just said in excess of $1 billion for operating income and that we are well on track to achieve that or exceed that. And that it was just to give you guys a sort of a landing place and then from there we don't get forward.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, got it because last year was over a billion. But yes, there was definitely some noise and obviously earnings there have been great. So, okay.

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to speak about the terrible tragedy surrounding the California wildfires - the live lost and tremendous loss of property, a major disaster still unfolding. Our job and the role we play in society is to support our policyholders. Our colleagues have been on the ground, supported by Chubb colleagues throughout the U.S., endeavoring to assist those clients who have lost property, been displaced from their homes and businesses, and had their lives severely disrupted. While it doesn\u2019t erase the enormous difficulty they have and will continue to experience, we\u2019re doing all we can in small and big ways to ease their burden. Our thoughts are with those who have suffered, and our gratitude goes to those firefighters and emergency workers who serve tirelessly. From a financial perspective, our current estimate of the cost of supporting our customers and helping them recover and rebuild from their catastrophe is $1.5 billion net pre-tax and is a first quarter 2025 event. Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter \u201924, which you have all seen, we had a great quarter which contributed to an outstanding year; in fact, the best in our company\u2019s history. For the quarter, record P&C underwriting income with a world-class combined ratio of 85.7, together with another quarter of record investment income led to core operating income of $2.5 billion. Operating earnings were up 9.4% on a pre-tax basis or 10.5% per share, though after tax they were distorted by the one-time tax benefit we received last year. Looking through that, operating income was up over 7.5% after tax. Global P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 6.7% in the quarter with good contributions from our P&C businesses globally of North America and overseas general. Premiums in our life insurance division grew 8.5% constant dollars. For the year, we generated operating income of $9.1 billion, up 11.5% adjusted for the one-time tax benefit and 13% on a per-share basis. Looking more broadly, over the past three years core operating income has grown over 65% and is nearly double the amount from pre-COVID 2019. All three major sources of income for our company produced record results last year. P&C underwriting income of $5.9 billion was up over 7% with a published combined ratio of 86.6. Adjusted net investment income grew 19.3% to $6.4 billion, and life insurance income topped $1 billion. For the year, we grew global P&C premiums 9.9% and life premiums 18.5% in constant dollars. Shareholder returns were strong. Our core operating ROE was about 14% and our return on tangible equity was 21.6. Per-share book and tangible book value grew 8.8 and 14.1 respectively. Our results top and bottom line continue to demonstrate the broad and diversified nature of the company and the consistency of contributions from our businesses around the world - North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, both commercial and consumer. As we look forward to 2025, we have good momentum and are optimistic about the year ahead, both top and bottom line, cat losses and FX notwithstanding. Returning to the quarter, our underwriting performance was outstanding while absorbing a more normal level of cat losses. P&C underwriting income was $1.6 billion and the current accident year combined ratio excluding cats was 82.2%, more than two points better than prior year and also a record result. Our prior year\u2019s reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $213 million and $856 million respectively, and speaks to the strength of reserves and conservative nature of our loss reserving practices. On the asset side, we\u2019re investment managers, our other business, and we had another excellent quarter in terms of performance. Our invested assets now stands at $151 billion, and it will continue to grow. For the quarter, adjusted net investment income was a record $1.7 billion, up 13.7%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5% versus 4.8% a year ago, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.6%. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment, again global P&C premiums increased 6.7% in the quarter, with commercial up 6.4% and consumer up 7.5%. All regions of the world contributed favorably. Life premiums grew 8.5%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market trends or themes were consistent with those of the previous quarter. Property has grown more competitive and large account shared and layered at E&S while pricing was favorable. Casualty is stable or firming, depending on the class, and overall pricing is ahead of loss cost tracking. Financial lines, particularly D&O and employment practices liability is where more competition is reaching for market share at the expense of current accident year underwriting margins. Overall, market conditions are favorable and we see good growth opportunity for over 80% of our global P&C business, commercial and consumer, as well as for our life business. North America and overseas general, Asia, Europe and Latin America, each with many areas of favorable growth opportunity. Our middle market and small commercial businesses globally, our U.S. E&S business, our U.S. high net worth business, global A&H and life, international personal lines, our digital business and specialty businesses such as our growing climate plus business. Now turning to the quarter, let me give you some more color by division. Beginning with North America, premiums excluding agriculture were up 6.3% and consisted of 10% growth in personal insurance and 5.1% growth in commercial, with P&C lines up 7.2% and financial lines down 2.9%. We had another strong quarter for new business, up over 22% versus prior year, and our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90.4%. These again speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major account and specialty division increased 4.6% with P&C up 5.8% and financial lines down 1.7%. Within major and specialty, our Westchester E&S business grew 8%. Premiums at our middle market division "

Pricing for property and casualty excluding financial lines and comp was up 9.9% with rates up 8.2% and exposure change of 1.6%. Financial lines pricing was down 3.3% with rates down 3.6%. In workers comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.7% with rates up 2.5% and exposure up 2.1%. Breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 6.9% with rates up 3.5% and exposure change of 3.3%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.7% with rates up 11.8% and exposure up 0.8%. Loss costs in North America remained stable - no change and in line with what we contemplate in our loss PICs. Our North America commercial lines business ran an amazing 83.9% published combined ratio for the year - again, an amazing result. In agriculture, where we are the market leader, our crop underwriting results this quarter were excellent, and we finished the year with $354 million in underwriting profit. Premiums were down from prior year due to lower commodity prices and the formulas for risk sharing with the government. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter with premium growth of 10%, including new business growth of 34%. Premiums in our true high net worth segments, a group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known for, grew 17.6%. Our home owners pricing was up over 12% in the quarter and ahead of loss cost trends, which remained steady. For the year, we ran an outstanding 83.6% combined ratio in our high net worth personal lines business. Turning to our international general insurance operations, premiums in the quarter for our retail business were up 7.7% with commercial lines up 10.3% and consumer up 4.7%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia Pac led the way with premiums up 12.2%. Europe grew 8.2%, including growth of 12% on the continent. Latin America grew just 2.5% and was impacted by foreign exchange. If you adjust for that, Latin America was up 11.5% in constant dollars. In our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up 3.7% and financial lines pricing was down more than 6%. Premiums in our London wholesale business were essentially flat. They were up 1.1% with prices down 4% as the London market continued to grow more competitive. For the year, our overseas general business ran an excellent 86.4 combined ratio. Our global reinsurance business had a strong quarter with premium growth of about 20% and finished the year with premiums up 32% and a combined ratio of 85.9, reflecting a more disciplined reinsurance market, both property and pockets of casualty. In our international life business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up over 26% in constant dollar. In combined insurance company, our U.S. worksite business grew 17.8%. Our life division finished the year with pre-tax income of $1.1 billion, which was ahead of what we originally projected for the year. We have good momentum in our life business, which continues to build. In summary, we had a great quarter and a great year. While we\u2019re in the risk business and there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty in the world, we\u2019re confident that our ability to continue growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate, cats and FX notwithstanding. Our earnings growth will come from three sources: P&C underwriting, investment income, and life income. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThank you Evan, and good morning. As you just heard, we concluded the year with another strong quarter, contributing to record full-year results across our three primary sources of earnings. Our balance sheet finished the year in an exceptionally strong position with book value of $64 billion and total invested assets of $151 billion. The quarter and full year produced adjusted operating cash flow of $4.2 billion and a record $15.9 billion respectively. It\u2019s also worth noting that during the quarter, AM Best affirmed our company\u2019s rating and stable outlook, and in January S&P affirmed our rating and stable outlook. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $725 million in share repurchases and $367 million in dividends. We returned $3.5 billion in total for the year, including $2 billion in share repurchases and $1.5 billion in dividends, which represented approximately 38% of our full year core operating earnings. The average share price on repurchases for the year was $269.23. Book value for the quarter and the year was adversely impacted by unrealized mark to market losses on our high quality fixed income portfolio due to interest rate changes, which we expect to amortize back to par over time, as well as foreign exchange losses. Book and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI grew 2.9% and 4.3% respectively for the quarter, and 10.8% and 15.4% respectively for the year. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 22% and 21.6% respectively, while our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 14.3% and 13.9%. Turning to investments, our A-rated portfolio, which now has an average book yield of 5%, produced adjusted net investment income of $1.69 billion, which included approximately $25 million of higher than normal income from private equity. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate between $1.67 billion and $1.75 billion over the next six months. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $607 million, of which $309 million was from Hurricane Milton and $140 million from Hurricane Helene. The remaining balance was principally from weather related events split 31% in the U.S. and 69% international. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a favorable $352 million pre-tax with favorable development split 17% in long tail lines, primarily from general casualty, and 83% in short tail lines, primarily from property and agriculture. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $139 million, primarily asbestos related. Our paid to incurred ratio for the year was 83%. Our core effective tax rate was 18.2% for the quarter and 17.5% for the year, which are below our previously guided range due to shifts in mix of income. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for 2025 to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, including the transition cash tax benefit provided on the adoption of the new Bermuda income tax. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions."

Evan, I\u2019m wondering if you can dig into a little bit the Cal fire loss estimate that you\u2019ve given out there. Does it include assessments, subrogation, kind of ground up? Maybe give us a little context on how we should be thinking about the $1.5 billion number.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. First of all, it\u2019s a ground-up number. It\u2019s our own losses. We don\u2019t go off of what we imagine as a total industry wildfire loss and a market share - this is our number that our adjusters on the ground have been able to estimate property by property. It does include an assessment for--our projection of an assessment from the fair [ph] plan, and we don\u2019t take credit in ours for subrogation.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nThat\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then my second question, Evan, I\u2019m just curious, looking at 2025, still getting some solid growth in commercial lines, call it mid to high single digit organic growth here in premium. But if you think of 2025, is that kind of a good number to target organically, and then is this kind of the period that we\u2019re looking at, that maybe you should start looking a little bit more at inorganic growth opportunities?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI love you, Brian. Yes, you know, I don\u2019t give--we don\u2019t give guidance on forward-looking, but your first statement--you know, your logic sounds pretty decent to me. I didn\u2019t say it, you said it. As for inorganic growth, money is not burning a hole in our pocket and, as you know, it\u2019s opportunistic and it\u2019s in support of our organic strategies, and it\u2019s got to be the right thing at the right price. We\u2019re always looking.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, appreciate it.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou\u2019re welcome."

That\u2019s a bit of a change versus what you guys have experienced over the last several quarters, so I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate on the favorable development that you\u2019re seeing there, because that\u2019s quite different than what you and others have been reporting, and any clarity on what sort of accident year it\u2019s coming from too would be helpful.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, I\u2019m going to correct your mental model to begin with. Our casualty, we study different portfolios of casualty each quarter. Some casualty portfolios, we have taken reserve strengthening, some portfolios we\u2019ve taken no action, some portfolios we\u2019ve had reserve releases, and there has not been a consistency per quarter except the consistency is the portfolios is we study each quarter, and so a cohort of casualty we studied this quarter had favorable development given the reserve strength in that portfolio.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it, helpful.

I don\u2019t recall you ever saying you love a sell-side analyst, so the new year\u2019s definitely starting off good for us!\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nDon\u2019t mess it up, Greg!\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nAll right. I\u2019m sure I can. Anyway, in your press release, you say you\u2019re growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate. You talk about the three buckets - PC, investment income and life insurance, so maybe you can, from a big picture perspective, unpack life insurance and talk about where you see the growth coming next year--or this year, I should say, \u201925, and how it might compare with how the growth came out for \u201924.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, you know, there was a lot of consolidation impact on the life income in the \u201923 year and a little bit of noise in \u201924. There was one-time stuff in \u201923, so to look through the underlying growth rate of that, it produced a really solid double-digit growth rate in income. When I looked through it, it was in that 12% to 14% range. When I look forward, I see that continuing and even strengthening. We have good momentum, and it\u2019s obviously Asia, and it\u2019s both north Asia and it\u2019s Southeast Asia. Our business in Korea, while the revenue growth is not overly exciting, the margin of that business continues to expand and our overall income is growing. It\u2019s a ballast of the business. It\u2019s supported by then faster--countries that are growing much more quickly - Hong Kong, Taiwan, China now growing more quickly for us, and each of those producing improved margin and therefore faster income growth. Southeast Asia, with Vietnam and Thailand, they had slower growth this past year, and they\u2019re accelerating as we go forward. Finally, we have two other businesses in Indonesia and in New Zealand that are good businesses, picking up momentum. It\u2019s in direct response marketing, it\u2019s in agency, and over 60% of the business, about 70% of it is really accident and health and risk-based type products, and the rest is very conservatively structured savings-related products, because people in Asia, you have two themes, you have an aging population in the north that requires a certain kind of savings and health-related product, and then you have people in Southeast Asia, where it\u2019s a younger population, family oriented, there are no social safety nets, and so they rely on these kinds of products much more than they do in other parts of the world. I\u2019ll remind you, unlike many regions of the world, these parts of Asia are growing, particularly Southeast Asia. The economic growth is multiples of what we\u2019re seeing in the West, and that just means a rising middle class.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nThanks for the perspective and detail. I guess pivoting to the other bucket, which is PC, it seems like the broader market is producing some pretty good results relative to longer term averages, and we\u2019re hearing about increased competition across a broader set of lines of business, even you, in your comments, talked about financial lines, so maybe you could spend a minute and give us some perspective on how you think where we are in the cycle and how Chubb is going to be positioned to come out of it.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, it goes to my comment, about 80% of the business growth, and where you therefore see the pockets of competition. As a backdrop and in the way you think about cycles--and I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while, we\u2019re in a more inflationary period in the insurance industry, and it\u2019s a prolonged one, than we have seen in a very long time. We went through decades of really relatively low inflation, on the short tail class side virtually pretty flat, and on the long tail side, there\u2019s always been pockets but it was running at a lower level. We\u2019re in a period of sustained inflation, so to just stay in place, rates have to move. It doesn\u2019t mean margins improve if they just keep pace with loss costs, so a certain amount of industry growth is just to reflect inflation. The competition, it\u2019s increasing in shared and large account business, so first large account will grow more slowly because you have a couple of lines of business where competition increases - property, shared and layered property, but it\u2019s well priced and it doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a decrease in margin. It means that to retain business, you become a bit more competitive, it\u2019s harder to grow. More want that business, so you\u2019re not going to see growth but you\u2019re going to see good results from all we\u2019re imagining as we go forward. E&S property, same thing. Financial lines in large account, same thing; and then primary casualty is not a real growth business, but it\u2019s a ballast that supports growth of many other lines for large account, so large account, not so much. In middle market and small commercial, growth opportunity, and it\u2019s a growth opportunity across many segments. By the way, there\u2019s certain secular change taking place in that business, and by the way, it\u2019s not simply in the United States, it\u2019s global; and then the consumer lines business from high net worth to personal lines outside the United States to our accident and health businesses, particularly with middle class in Asia and in Latin America on both the life side and the non-life side, when I add it all up--anyway. Does that give you a sense?\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nYes, it does. What did you mean by the secular change comment?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWhen you--particularly in middle market in the United States, I\u2019ll take that as an example, with all of the change in climate and cat activity, and with the change in the legal environment around the trial bar and social inflation, regional and mutuals have a harder time. They\u2019re not equipped with the data, with the balance sheet, with the depth of business in reinsurance relationships to be able to--and with the technology to be able to compete the same way. That over time is shifting market share, and it advantages a few larger players.\n\nGreg Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):"

But just curious if you\u2019re painting a picture that Chubb\u2019s competitive advantages are growing versus some of its peers, would you still have aspirations to do kind of inorganic things in the small midmarket space in the U.S., or less so as time goes on?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nOur focus is on organic SME - small and middle market, and it\u2019s organic. That is our focus and has been our focus. Anything that\u2019s inorganic is simply opportunistic, and that\u2019s not our focus. It\u2019s opportunistic.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, and lastly switching gears, on the investment portfolio, there\u2019s been a bit of an increase in equities over the last couple quarters - we\u2019re up to about $9 billion.

First off, that specific $5 billion shift relates to us actually moving about $5 million of investment-grade corporates into a fund for, call it investment efficiency purposes between different entities. The underlying is still investment-grade fixed income, but because of GAAP, we have to show it as equity, so there\u2019s no underlying change in that. In terms of the going forward, we\u2019ve spoken about our strategy--you\u2019ll see it in the investor presentation, there will be a change in investment allocation, slight change which we put out there in that investor deck.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Will you have to make any changes in the way you approach that market, and just interested in any thoughts you have on what needs to be done to sort of stabilize the insurance market there.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, thank you for that question. Look - California is a difficult market for insurance companies, and it has only become more difficult over time. The state along with the pressure it receives from consumer advocacy groups suppresses the ability to charge a fair price for the risk and tailored coverages to improve availability and affordability of insurance for the citizens of the state. Insurers are unable to generate a reasonable risk-adjusted return commensurate with the risk of ensuring natural perils such as wildfire and the cost in California associated with reconstruction following a disaster. This suppression of pricing signals, which are rising, encourages more risk taking by individuals and businesses as to where they choose to live or work, and it encourages less risk management or loss mitigation activity, and they\u2019re part as well by federal and state and local governments, who all have a hand in loss mitigation activity that actually is occurring, or not occurring. In a word, economics incent behaviors, and California is impacting those economic signals. As insurers have reduced their exposures in the state, the state has offered more under-priced coverage through its own insurer of last resort. Frankly, it\u2019s an unsustainable model, and one way or the other, the citizens of the state pay the price for coverage. California is not alone in this regard, but it certainly stands out. We\u2019ve been shrinking our exposure in California for some time; for example, in the area where the wildfires occurred, our exposure has been reduced by over 50%. We\u2019re not going to write insurance where we cannot achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted return for taking the risk.\n\nAlex Scott - Equity Research Analyst (Barclays):\nThat\u2019s really helpful. Maybe just a follow-on question to that, would you expect what\u2019s going on in California and sort of the fallout from that to affect property pricing more broadly? I mean, it seems like the world\u2019s becoming a riskier place and certainly price adequacy has seemed pretty good in property and other areas, but will this be enough to change thinking, whether at the primary or reinsurance level, in your view?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYou know, it\u2019s too early to tell. I don\u2019t know yet. As the loss, the magnitude of this loss emerges and grows, more of it begins to find its way to reinsurance balance sheets and to other balance sheets, and that\u2019s going to be the question, is what is the ultimate size of the loss and where does it end up? That will give us--that will determine whether it has a broader impact on overall property pricing, which in my judgment overall is adequate. This is a reminder of why the industry needs to maintain pricing adequacy.\n\nAlex Scott - Equity Research Analyst (Barclays):"

Yes, we haven\u2019t disclosed that in a while, Elyse; and again, how we\u2019re thinking about things, consistent with what we talked about in our investor presentation, is looking at our capital as also a source of investment as we gradually and incrementally increase our asset allocation towards alts. That\u2019s just starting, so I\u2019ll say right now, looking at the year behind us, it will be in a range similar to, call it a year ago that we discussed and people backward computed, so. It was in the range of ROE looking backwards of around 2% on ROE and 6% on ROTE.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThat\u2019s helpful. Then my second question, you provided tax guidance, and I think you had said that it considers some transition cash tax benefit from Bermuda. I had also thought that there was some--the potential for some reversals of the DTAs that were set up, so I\u2019m assuming--I think that might not take place this year, but it might be a couple years out. Are you guys just assuming there\u2019s no change in the DTA structure of what was set up a year ago?\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes Elyse, from an accounting perspective, it\u2019s based on Bermuda law, and Bermuda law isn\u2019t expected to change. If it changes, we\u2019d have to look at it. OECD came out with some administrative guidance a couple of weeks ago that has to be reviewed and see how it applies. As you may have seen, the new administration has come through with saying they\u2019re not going to participate in the global minimum tax of OECD and are vacating on that basis, so we have a sense of where--we have a very clear sense of where we are for \u201925 and \u201926, and one thing we know is longer term, it\u2019s very uncertain, particularly with the new administration along with China, India, and some other very large countries not being involved at all as well.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIt never involved Swiss law--\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSwiss law, yes.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, it\u2019s messy.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThen on--I\u2019ll throw one in for Evan. You guys have been talking about competition in financial lines for some time, and obviously pulled back there. Do you--what do you think it takes, I guess, for things to get better there? Is there something--are you not expecting conditions, I guess, to change at any point in the near term?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think there\u2019s some--I think as losses emerge and it re-normalizes, that will be an ameliorating factor.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay, thank you."

      "raw_bytes": "Yaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nThank you, good morning. Evan, at the risk of maybe changing your sentiment around the sell-side analysts here so quickly, I do want to go back to something I asked last quarter with regards to North America commercial premium growth, which was 2% on a gross premium basis. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with the pricing environment, which seems to be ahead of that, and the opportunities that you\u2019re seeing and the appetite that you have. Maybe you can walk us through the puts and takes there.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI\u2019m not sure what you--can you be more clear?\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nSure. Your premium growth, gross premium growth was 2%. I think the pricing environment in North America P&C, if we take the bits and pieces of pricing that you offered, is north of that. It seems to also be a bit of raw trend--\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think you have to start with net premium growth, not gross premium growth. Net premium growth--\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nWhy would that be?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, because net--gross premium growth has too many distortions of transactions that we do, that frankly distort that number, large transactions, where it may be a self-insured program or it\u2019s a structured program, so gross has puts and calls based on the premium flows with our clients. If you get to a middle market business, it\u2019s more steady; but when you have large account and then you have gross line, even in E&S business with a client, that\u2019s what makes a lot of noise and a lot of difference. You\u2019re never going to get there. You have to start at net premium. Now, I could just tell you that, and I\u2019m giving you that as an explanation, not as a--this is nothing to debate.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nFair enough, and if we take the net premium growth, which was 5%, versus roughly 7% pricing?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, it\u2019s a mix of--there\u2019s a mix of business, there is a retention. It doesn\u2019t translate directly, it never does. You start with a retention rate, you then have to add new business, you have to do it line by line and the mix of it, so you\u2019ll hear overall pricing, but now take overall pricing and you have to adjust for the mix of business. When you\u2019re trying to translate to revenue [indiscernible]. If you want, offline we will give you a simple math lesson of that and take you through it.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nGreat, I\u2019m always--\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI don\u2019t mean a lesson in a bad way. We\u2019ll take you through and give you some--you know, maybe another way to help you think about it.\n\nYaron Kinar - Equity Research Analyst (Jefferies):\nGreat, always eager to learn. Thank you.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):"

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you and welcome to our March 31, 2025, first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing, and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. Let me begin with a few words around the external environment. There is currently a great deal of uncertainty and confusion surrounding our government's approach to trade, it's impacting business and consumer confidence as well as our image broadly. The odds of recession have risen substantially and higher inflation is all but certain, to what degree is an open question. We have competing priorities between our stated trade, economic, and fiscal objectives and coherence of policy has yet to emerge. I hope we can reach agreements on trade, reduce or eliminate tariffs, and reconcile our priorities quickly. Certainty and predictability are jacks to open for confidence, growth and the image of our country as a leader, a reliable partner, and a place to do business. As you saw from the numbers, we had a good first quarter, considering the significant catastrophe losses we incurred in the California wildfires. In terms of revenue growth, the headline number was impacted by foreign exchange due to a strong dollar, which has since weakened substantially and one-time premium-related items in our North America business. We produced $1.5 billion in core operating income, and it was down 31%, but it was supported by excellent underlying underwriting results, double-digit growth in investment income and strong life insurance income. Total company premiums grew 5.7% in constant dollars. Our published combined ratio was 95.7% with underwriting income of $441 million, a notable result given $1.6 billion of CAT losses. Calendar year underwriting income was supported by a current accident year combined ratio of 82.3%, a nearly 1.5 point improvement from prior year. Excluding CATs, current accident year underwriting income was up 12%. Additionally, we had favorable prior year reserve development of $255 million. On the asset side for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was $1.7 billion, and it was up 12.7%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5% and our current new money rate is averaging 5.5%. Tariffs in the federal budget deficit impact interest rates, the yield curve, spreads, asset values, and the dollar in ways that are not good for our country. As a company, we are predominantly buy-and-hold fixed income investors and benefit from higher yields, and as a multinational, our revenue and income benefit from a weaker dollar. In the quarter, our alternative investments produced modestly lower-than-usual private equity distribution related income. It's a combination of simply normal volatility and financial market conditions. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 13%. Peter is going to have more to say about the financial items. As you saw in the first quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Liberty Mutual's Business in Thailand and Vietnam. The two companies offer a range of consumer and commercial P&C products with distribution through 56 branches and 2,600 brokers and agents, both fit well with our own business. The combined operations produced about $275 million in premiums in 2024, over 90% of which is in Thailand. For perspective, Thailand is now over $1 billion in premium revenue for Chubb, non-life and life, and we're among the leading P&C companies in the country once the entities are merged, in fact, we'll be number four. We closed Thailand on April 1st and expect to close Vietnam by early '26. Now turning to growth. Pricing and the rate environment. P&C revenue grew 3.2% in the quarter, 5% in constant dollars, with commercial up 4.6%, consumer up 6%. Adjusting for the one-time items in North America, P&C premium revenue grew over 6.5% in constant dollar. All regions of the world contributed favorably. Premiums in our life insurance division grew over 10%. In terms of the commercial P&C underwriting environment, large account related short-tail business, both admitted and E&S, is growing quite competitive. A lot more capital is chasing the business, prices are softening. We are, of course, disciplined and we're not going to write business below a technically adequate price. On the other hand, middle-market and small commercial property, both admitted retail and non-admitted wholesale or E&S, remain much more disciplined and orderly. Rates, in fact, continue to rise, and we are growing in this area. Casualty continues to firm in all areas that require REIT, retail and E&S, a large account, middle-market, and again, we're growing. Financial lines remain soft. With that as backdrop, I want to give you some more color by division and we'll start with North America, where premiums were up 3.4%. Growth again was impacted by the two one-time items I mentioned, reinstatement premiums related to the California wildfires and personal insurance and larger than usual one-off structured transactions, I think, loss portfolio transfers written last year in our major accounts commercial division. Adjusting for both, North America was up 6.4%, including growth of 10.1% in personal insurance, 5.3% in commercial. Commercial P&C lines were up 6.4% and financial lines were down 1.3%. Looking through those one-time items is a more representative view of our run rate growth for North America commercial P&C. Premiums in our very large middle-market division increased almost 8%, an excellent result. P&C up over 10% and financial lines down about 2%. Premiums in our major account and specialty division declined 1.7% and adjusting for the one-time transactions, they were up 3.1%, 3.6% in P&C and financial lines down 1%. Major in specialty is comprised of E&S business, which was up 10.7% and our major accounts retail business, which was down 1.3%. Overall, commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding fin lines and comp, was up 8.3% with rates up 6.4% and exposure change of 1.8%. Going a step further, property pricing was up 3.1% with rates down 0.7%, offset by exposure change of 3.8%. For property, pricing was down 9.6% in large account business, both admitted and E&S and up 10.2% in middle and small, again, both admitted and E&S. Casualty pricing in North America was up 13.4% with rates up 12.6% and exposure up 0.7%. Financial lines pricing was down 3.2% and that's all rate. In comp, primary comp pricing was f"

In comp, primary comp pricing was flat while large account risk management was up 7.5%. In North America Commercial, our selected loss cost trend has declined modestly from 6.8% in '24 to 6.5%, with casualty running 8.9% and property 4.5%. We are mindful of a potential impact tariffs could have on short-tail lines of business and are watching closely. On the consumer side of North America, our high net-worth personal lines business had another very strong quarter with premium growth of 10.1% adjusted for the reinstatement premiums. New business growth was almost 20%. Premiums in our upper high net-worth segments grew over 16%. Homeowners' pricing was up 12.5% in the quarter and ahead of loss costs, which are running 8.7%. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Premiums were up 1.8% or 6.5% in constant dollar. The dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter versus a year ago, but substantially declined in value versus major currencies in recent weeks. In the quarter, international commercial lines grew about 7.5%. Consumer was up 5%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia and Latin America, both grew 6.1%, while Europe grew 5.5%, including growth of 6% on the continent, while premiums in our London wholesale business were up nearly 8%. In our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up 2.6% and financial lines pricing was down 5.5%. Loss cost trends in international retail were in fact down 80 basis points from '24, 5.8% to 5%. Our global reinsurance business had a strong quarter with premium growth of 14%. In our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up 15.5% in constant dollar. And in combined insurance company, our US worksite business grew 18.6%. Our life division produced over $290 million of pre-tax income in the quarter, up 15.7% in constant dollar. In summary, we are in the risk business, volatility is a feature, while we are impacted by the wildfires, our underlying fundamentals are excellent. We had a good quarter. And as I observed at the beginning of the year, about 80% of our global P&C business, commercial and consumer, and our life business are very good growth prospects. In fact, when you listen, as I read to you and described going across divisions, the growth rate of the various businesses, FX aside, I think that speaks to the broad nature and the 80% I'm talking about. There is a lot of opportunity and I'm mindful that the external environment has become more uncertain. I have confidence in what we can control. In that regard, in our ability to continue growing operating and earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate. That's an FX notwithstanding. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. Our strong first quarter results were supported by exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity. Book value now stands at $65.7 billion and reached an all-time high of $164 on a per share basis and total invested assets were $152.3 billion. The quarter produced adjusted operating cash flow of $2 billion, including approximately $600 million of net loss payments for California wildfires. In the quarter, we returned $751 million of capital to shareholders, including $385 million in share repurchases and $366 million in dividends. The average share price on our repurchases for the quarter was $286.18. Book value for the quarter was favorably impacted by unrealized mark-to-market gains on our high-quality fixed-income portfolio due to declining interest rates. Book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively for the quarter. As you know, rates have since backed up. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter was 13%, while our core operating ROE for the quarter was 8.6%. The quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.64 billion. Excluding the California wildfires, the approximately $170 million balance was principally weather-related, split 74% US and 26% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a favorable $268 million pre-tax with favorable development of $313 million in short-tail lines, a mix of commercial and consumer, and unfavorable development of $45 million in long-tail commercial lines. Turning to investments, our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.67 billion, which was at the lower end of our six month guidance and was negatively impacted by approximately $25 million of lower-than-usual private equity distributions and realizations and $10 million of unfavorable FX movements. The income generated from our public fixed-income, private credit, and strategic holdings portfolios performed in line with expectations. While the direction of financial markets remains uncertain and volatile, we expect second quarter adjusted net investment income to be at the midpoint of our previously guided six month guidance. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter was 87% or 86% excluding tax, PPD, and agriculture. Our core effective tax rate was within our previously guided range at 19.1%. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. And at this point, we're happy to take the questions."

      "raw_bytes": "Gregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nAll right. So in your comments, Evan, you talked about the 80% of the business and the growth outlook. The tariffs are an issue, potential for increasing inflationary pressures. You called out the risk of recession, and frankly, it feels like there's increasing price competition in many lines of property, casualty insurance, both in North America and globally. So with all of that, how are you thinking about the growth strategy for the company, both inside and outside the US?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. There's no change to our strategy. Our strategy is enduring. We see growth opportunities that sometimes you get more joy for the pleasure depending on market conditions, sometimes you get less. That doesn't change the opportunities. And I think as I just went through for you, it's very, it's steady with, and I'll put a point on it from what we talked about at year end, we talked about at investor dinners, my shareholder letter speaks to middle-market and small business globally for us growth opportunities. It varies, that's a big space, and we have our own unique strategies to pursue that opportunity. And it is a global opportunity again. E&S and the US, which again, frankly is a theme of small commercial and middle-market commercial, our personal lines business in the US, our consumer business overseas, and then, of course, there are areas of large account business that continue to show good growth opportunity right now to us and some of that is more tactical and some of it is more strategic. Yes, property is growing and everything I've had to say is contemplating the underwriting environment as we see it, which is not, with directionally not a surprise to us, and we've been talking about it, property growing more competitive in large account, whether it's E&S or embedded. Middle-market, property and small remains more disciplined that way. And casualty businesses responding to loss cost environment. And then you add all -- to all of it the things we've been doing to improve job, in terms of our presence geographically, in terms of how we approach segments of business in terms of industries that we have an expertise or focus on, think of Climate+ right now, think of lines of business like cyber. And then you think of our technology and what we've done that way in our use of data that allows us to access more customers depending on geography and to partner with different forms of distribution to reach customer segments, whether it's middle-market in Asia or it's automobile in Mexico, or frankly, it's pet insurance in the United States. And I could go on. Thank you for the question.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nThank you for the details. I have a follow-up. I was going to go in one direction, but then you brought up technology and for us on the outside, when we ask you about technology, we'll get a couple of sentence answer, but it's really hard for us to figure out what's really going on and what's sort of maintenance technology spend versus what's game changing. In your annual report, you put a technology sort of theme on the cover. So maybe you can spend a minute and give us some additional commentary on the technology piece as part of your first answer.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, I understand you're at a place, where you make the comment, it's hard for you guys to figure out what's going on. I got it and we have no intention of being more transparent than we are. I said before, we spend over $1 billion, it's about $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion on technology. Roughly half is maintenance and managing what we got 50%, 55% of it and the balance is development of all kinds, whether it's legacy, more what you think of as legacy modernized to provide straight through processing, whether it is technology around the use of data, to improve analytics, to improve our AI capabilities, to supplement what humans do or replace what humans do or improve our insight, whether it's technology that allows us to connect to both customer and distribution partners in an efficient way, whether it's technology and how it's used that speeds up our cycle times of change. We're just far up the road in this. And technology helps to maintain what is the best expense ratio in the industry, and over time, even lower than that expense ratio. So thanks a lot, Greg.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nThere was some, actually, some useful information in that answer. So thanks for your time.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThere you go. I just kept it at a certain level. I can't give a roadmap to everyone else who would like one from us.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

In regards to the outlook commentary you made, Evan, about continue to expect operating income, EPS to grow at a double-digit rate, and I think you were saying ex-catastrophes and FX, I'm curious if you can kind of give us some flavor of what you think catastrophe inflation is. I guess we can obviously see in our models could CAT losses for you all and others. And I feel like Chubb's CAT loss has actually been better-than-expected, but still elevated for the industry. So any sense of kind of how Chubb is thinking about weather loss and inflation and whether you're able to keeping up or not? Thanks.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nMike, on inflation, I gave you and put out the loss cost trends that's, that we are using, and that is proxy. I can't -- I don't have a crystal ball and I cannot prognosticate where inflation actually goes from here in terms of rate and to which goods and products. Any increase in inflation is fundamentally tariff-related and that's a moving target and a chaotic picture at the moment. And it's the kind of thing that we can stay on top of if we're watching early data around goods and around labor costs have to do with physical property construction, reconstruction, infrastructure, et cetera. So that part we're keeping our eye on, but I gave you some sense of inflation. On FX, we have no idea. It bounces around, its ephemeral, the direction of travel, and if policies continue as a weaker dollar. When it comes to catastrophes, well, you're asking me a crystal ball view. There is a natural volatility. Talk about it all the time, but around CATs, you're never going to hit what you price for exactly, which is what the AALs are, and what you're expected is in a quarter, it's either above it, it's below it. You know it moves around and whether one year is going to be heavier than the year before, which for us was lighter last year and the year before that. Who knows? I think handwringing, I don't do any handwringing about it, and we're not. And we update, which is more important to us, we update our view around CATs by peril on an ongoing basis as data additional data comes in and we have more insight and that allows us to ensure that the way we're pricing for risk and our accumulation appetite around CAT perils by geography are within what we'd imagine and contemplate. That's how we run the business. And volatility quarter-to-quarter that's not our obsession.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nUnderstood. That's helpful. Just switching gears quickly.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nBy the way, I gave you all that as an answer, but we don't give guidance, so.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nI mean, understood, as you know that we tend to look at recent CAT loads and update future CAT loads taking into the new average. So but now switching gears with respect to --\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI've never found the kind of consensus, which is an aggregation of different analysts' work. I've never found it, something other than reasonably rational to me. I don't look at point estimates. I look at the trend of it in the relative neighborhood of quantum and I've never found it anything but rational.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Understood. I feel like maybe back in the day, there was a view of your CAT load in the proxy, but I can't remember if that's, that was removed or still there. But I'm just switching gears real quick, I think, much of our incoming from investors is focused on North America commercial social inflation, reserve releases, very strong this quarter, any comments on kind of the environment? I know you gave us the update on what you felt your loss cost inflation was, but any commentary on puts and takes on reserve releases or even the underlying loss ratio, was excellent and improved this quarter? Thanks.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, look, the only thing I will say for those who are obsessed simply about North America, it's a large part of our business, but it's -- it really -- it just -- it misses the story of Chubb and who we are, the global nature of the business outside of the United States is not some gray mass that just is a thing out there. It's 54 countries in vital regions of the world and you look at the growth and you look at the quantum and you look at the contribution and to simply obsess about North America and North America loss costs, I think, actually does investors a disservice, but I leave it to the -- to those to do their job as they think they ought to. On the reserve releases, we review again a cohort of portfolios, a different cohort each quarter, and update our view of development. This quarter is generally a smaller quarter in what we review on both the property and the casualty side of the business. And so there was -- this was just an amalgamation of those various long-tail lines, smaller portfolios, embedded and E&S and property the same, physical lines the same.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

And our capital allocation, you see that we made acquisition of a modest nature in Southeast Asia. We'll continue leading in that way, I think it's a metaphor for the notion that it's steady as she goes, China-US aside, the balance of the world there's always going to be a certain amount of volatility, there is -- and as a multinational you know that. We're mindful of the increased volatility that is occurring as a result of our, in particular, our administration's approach to foreign policy and trade as it's emerging and that keeps us mindful.

Just a question, it definitely sounds like a tale of two cities on the property side with still the small middle-market remaining healthy, but definitely some areas of competition picking up in large account, E&S. I'm wondering if you can help me think through just your view, Evan, if you think sort of that competition that we're seeing in the large account E&S market is sort of a sign of what's to come in the small and middle-market or is there something structural that's different between those two different markets that we should think about where the pricing in the middle-market and small market is more durable on the property side?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSo, David, it's always been structurally different, that's the point, large account business is brokerage driven, you don't need a lot of physical presence. You need not a lot of capability as a company, you need capacity. You need some underwriters and you can participate in the capacity play of large account business. Welcome to a lot of E&S, welcome to London open market, welcome to large companies, companies that engage in large account business and have just a few urban locations to do it out. Now, being the lead on those accounts, issuing the paper, managing the claims, doing the engineering, well that starts to separate it and how you participate. But think about shared and layered large account business. It's a capacity play for most of it up and down the chain. So you come and you put a blind down. Middle-market, small commercial insurance is widely distributed thousands of producers and agents, small average premiums. They typically don't buy one line from you, they buy multiple lines from you. You've got to have presence. You've got to have a lot of capability to support the development of that kind of business. Yes, on the fringes, there are ends of it. It get boxed up by a few brokers and they bring it in a facilitized way. But the vast majority of the market is now you're talking about broad geographic reach, local reach, local capability, multiline, claims capability, engineering capability in a broadly distributed way.

And economic -- with like the fiscal spending and what that might do to sort of boost growth over there relative to some of the potential weakness that might be coming in the US.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. We have the pleasure in the United States and we ought to really cherish it of being the reserve currency of the world, which gives us a borrowing capability. It certainly doesn't give any other region or country of the world and let's be careful how we abuse that or we won't have that privilege. Others are more constrained in their ability to use fiscal stimulus. Europe, there'll be more fiscal stimulus. It'll be both in the security end and maybe in certain industries as the Europeans are determined to stand on their own two feet, be more independent a bit, and the key is Germany, and they're unlocking the door to much more fiscal, which will support economic growth. All over the world, the theme in our mind is that whatever we thought economic growth was going to be six months ago, to state the obvious, that number has come down. What it will actually be, we don't know, and it will vary by region. Asia will be impacted. Consumers in Asia will be impacted. Export and domestic industries will be impacted. How much is a question mark because the fact that is not clear to us yet. But for Chubb, it will be steady as it goes. It means that growth could be better, growth could be a little worse, don't know, and all that we had in mind when I said I am confident and remain confident in our ability to grow earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate and our thinking about what could be volatility around growth notwithstanding that won't have a significant impact on it at this time.

I'm not going to put out more numbers than I just gave you. I think it stands on its own in its informative, Meyer. What can I help you with? What would you like to know?\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nSo I guess the question that I'm seeing a lot is that the outside that social inflation is running rampant and is a risk of tariffs, which all else equal, I guess would argue for a higher assumed loss trend rather than coming down a little.\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWhen you measure it up against where we were, casualty, we're talking by the way, it's all the right side of the dust off. So let's start with that. And on the casualty side, given the blend of business, the loss cost on trend in aggregate and long tail is up modestly, 10s of basis points. And on the physical side, given the mix of business and what we see, it's down 10s of points, I want to say from memory, 0.3% approximately. So we're not talking much. And on the physical side, look, I know what our PEGs contemplate for loss cost. We're mindful of tariff and we will see as we go forward. At the moment, we set our PEGs conservatively, and therefore, we don't see a need to adjust trend.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That is perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. Second unrelated question, I guess one potential impact of tariffs is that there's less demand for crops, and thinking of soybeans going to China. What can you do with, say, North American agriculture to ameliorate that impact on this year's underwriting results?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, right now, if I understand your question, when I look at the -- we look at the major crops, so let's take corn and soybean, that's the majority of it. We priced our contracts. We priced the contracts, the government formula sets it in February and you have a certain going in crop price insurance contracts. As you know, it's yield and price that are the exposure. And right now, actually, corn and soybeans are within a few percentage points of the February pricing. There hadn't been much change. Beyond that, which I won't go into any detail on because it's proprietary, you know, that like reinsurance, we use hedging to protect a certain degree of volatility, and let's just say, we're mindful of that tool and we know how to employ them and do it.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

Evan, you mentioned being mindful of the impact tariffs could have on short-tail lines and it's clearly a moving target. Do you have any early sense of the magnitude of the loss trend impact? And I was also curious on how you're able to incorporate a moving target like that into your pricing strategy today or is that still wait and see?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSo you want to underwrite with facts and you don't want to anticipate with conjecture, unless you have clarity around your conjecture, being a, if you have 70% or 80% certainty as an example, then we would take a certain period. There is no clarity at the moment. It is a moving target, the administration has an objective to reach trade agreements over 90 days with a large number of countries. And what will that mean in terms of tariffs go forward? It's unclear. I have a stated objective just voiced to have negotiations with China, knowing China, knowing the complexity of our trade relationship that will be a protracted discussion that would not be marked. Demand, if tariffs remain high will be impacted. How will that impact inflation? There's uncertainty around all of that. Now let's get to some math. When I think about property insurance today and I think about the current accident year, this year, keep in mind, loss ratio develops on an earned basis. So a lot of it has already been written, it's already being earned, it's already in the can. There you go. As you go forward on a written basis, and as months go along, if we see a change in inflation, the markers that will in fact change inflation, we will adjust our pricing in that cohort. Go one step further, imagine on the physical side how much comes from Mexico and Canada, as an example, as inputs. What will happen in terms of tariffs in North America and in terms of USMCA negotiations? So on the claim side, all of this is on our minds as we measure the change of price of goods and of labor. And all of it is on our minds as we watch negotiations that will ultimately lead to a more steady and clear environment around what will tariff levels actually be and apply to what goods and then there's a lag on it.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. Thank you for all those details. If I could ask a follow-up, I wanted to get a sense of your view of E&S market growth for Chubb? We've talked about more competition in E&S property, but there's also, it seems like some secular tailwinds for the E&S market, would you expect Chubb to kind of continue to grow more in the E&S market versus admitted going forward?\n\nEvan Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI just gave commentary that said, we grew E&S at 10%. I explained the property market, the casualty market, mixed into all of that. Our discipline in underwriting and what we see as opportunity, we grew E&S 10.1%. I also gave a sense of 80% of our business with growth opportunity go forward. So I'm going to leave it at that. Thank you very much."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you have the floor.\n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2025 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainities and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions, questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter. Core operating EPS was a record $6.14, up 14% from a year ago, supported by record underwriting, strong investment results and good premium revenue growth. All of our businesses and regions of the world contributed to the quarter's growth, particularly in North America, our middle market and small commercial, Personal Lines and E&S businesses and in international, both commercial and consumer P&C in all regions and life insurance in Asia and the U.S. Core operating income of $2.5 billion was a record result, up 13%. The results demonstrate the broad-based diversified nature of our company geographically by customer segment and product area. Our balance of business and presence provides us a wide range of opportunities, which supports long-term sustainable and profitable growth. In the quarter, we produced record underwriting income on both the published and current accident year ex cat basis, supported by premium growth and underwriting margin improvement. Published underwriting income of $1.6 billion was up 15% from a year ago, leading to a combined ratio of 85.6%, more than 1 percentage point better than a year earlier. Current accident year underwriting income, excluding cats, was up almost 11.5%, supported by a combined ratio of 82.3%, again, nearly a full point improvement from prior year. On the invested asset side, for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was nearly $1.7 billion, up 8%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5.1%, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.4%. Our operating cash flow in the quarter, which supports investments was quite strong, $3.2 billion. Given federal deficits, a weakening dollar and our country's trade policies, I expect the trend is towards higher inflation and a steeper yield curve, which is an issue for our country, but will support our company's continued growth in investment income. Tangible book value growth, our primary measure of wealth creation was up 23.7% per share from a year ago and 8% from the previous quarter. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 21%, very strong result. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Global P&C premiums, which exclude agriculture, grew 5.8% and 6.4% in constant dollars, with commercial up 4.2% and consumer up 11.9%. Premiums in our Life Insurance division grew almost 17.5%. In terms of the U.S. commercial P&C underwriting environment, large account-related short-tail business, both admitted and E&S has grown quite competitive. A lot more capital is chasing the property business and prices are softening, while terms and conditions remain steady. We are, of course, disciplined and we're not going to write business below an adequate price. While others are leaning in, we've begun walking away where necessary. On the other hand, middle market and small commercial property remain much more disciplined and orderly. Rates continue to rise, and we're growing property in this area. Casualty continues to firm in all areas that require rate, retail and E&S, both large account and middle market. And again, we are growing. While financial lines remain soft, we're seeing signs of firming in discrete classes. That is backdrop, I'll give you some more color by division. Beginning with North America, P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 5.3%, including growth of 9.1% in personal insurance and 4.1% in commercial. P&C lines up 4.2% and financial lines actually up 3.6%. In Commercial, we had a good quarter for new business, up 7% versus prior year, driven by middle market across the board and in large account and E&S casualty lines. Our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 86%. Premiums in our leading middle market division grew 8.4%, another excellent result with P&C up 10% and financial lines up 2%. Our Small Commercial business grew about 10%. Premiums in our Major Accounts and Specialty division grew 1.5% with our large account business essentially flat and our E&S business up 5.6%. Both were heavily impacted by premium reductions in property. Overall commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding financial lines and comp was up 4.5%, with rates up 1.6% and exposure change of 2.9%. Property pricing was down 2.5% with rates down about 7%, offset by exposure change of 4.9%. Importantly, going a step further, property pricing was down within 12% in large account business, both admitted in the E&S and it was up over 8% in middle market and small commercial. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.6%, with rates up 10.6% and exposure up 0.9%. Financial lines pricing was down 1.2% and in Workers' Comp, primary comp pricing was essentially flat, while large account risk management pricing was up over 7.5%. In North America Commercial, our selected loss cost trends remained steady across the board. No change from what I gave you last quarter. On the consumer side of North America, our high-net-worth personal lines business had a simply outstanding quarter, with premium growth exceeding 9%. New business growth was more than 17%. Homeowners pricing was up 10.2% in the quarter and ahead of loss costs, which remained steady at 8.9%. I expect the kinds of results we're showing in personal lines to endure and continue. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Premiums were up 8.5% or over 10% in constant dollar. Commercial lines grew about 7% and consumer was up more than 15%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia grew over 12.5% in constant dollar. Europe grew over 8% and Latin America grew over 17%. Premiums in our London wholesale business were up over 7%. In our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up just 0.5% and Financial lines pricing was down over 6.5%. The loss cost trend in our international retail business remains steady. Like in North America, large account commercial property shared and layered has become much more competitive, particularly in London. While in the rest of the world, property is growing more competitive, conditions remain reasonably orderly, though they vary by market. In our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 18% in constant dollar. And in North America, combined insurance compan"

And in North America, combined insurance companies premiums grew over 17%. Our Life division produced $305 million of pretax income in the quarter, up about 10.5% -- as you know, the economic and geopolitical environment is dynamic and evolving. We're in a period of greater uncertainty. The U.S. recently passed tax legislation and efforts towards deregulation should support economic growth. On the other hand, budget deficits, trade and immigration policies and a weaker dollar are potential headwinds that can impact both economic growth and inflation. The picture is complex. With that as context, Chubb's fundamentals and our positioning are simply excellent. Organizationally, we're performing at a high level, coupled with our broad-based global diversification and a disciplined, energized and talented culture of professionals. As I observed at the beginning of the year, roughly 80% of our businesses have good growth and continued growth prospects. There is a lot of opportunity, and I have confidence in our ability to continue to grow both top and bottom line at a superior rate, tax and FX notwithstanding. To reinforce from all I can see overall, I expect the company's pattern of growth, revenue and earnings to continue. Now I'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and we're going to take some of your questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you've heard from Evan, we had another strong quarter that contributed to quarterly and 6-month records. Our results were supported by exceptional balance sheet strength, including all-time highs in book value of $69 billion and cash and invested assets of $160 billion. Additionally, the quarter produced adjusted operating cash flow of $3.2 billion. There are a few capital-related matters I'd like to touch on. In May, our Board authorized, a new $5 billion share repurchase program that took effect on July 1 with no expiration date. In the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $388 million in dividends and $676 million in share repurchases. Book and tangible book value per share grew 6.1% and 8%, respectively for the quarter. Book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 3.4% and 4.5%, respectively, for the quarter and 10.3% and 15.3%, respectively, from the prior year. This quarter, we also closed on the acquisition of Liberty Mutual's P&C business in Thailand, which diluted tangible book value by about $230 million or about 0.5 percentage point of growth. Our core operating return on tangible equity and core operating ROE were 21% and 13.9%, respectively, for the quarter. Pretax catastrophe losses were $630 million for the quarter, split 60% U.S. and 40% international from a variety of events. Pretax prior period development in the quarter in our active company was favorable $319 million, split 87% short tail, primarily commercial property-related lines and personal auto and 13% long tail. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $70 million, mostly from [indiscernible] related claims development. Turning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio increased over $6 billion this quarter, reflecting strong operating cash flow as well as positive mark-to-market and favorable FX, partially offset by shareholder distributions. Adjusted net investment income was $1.69 billion, and we now expect adjusted net investment income to be approximately $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion next quarter. Our core effective tax rate was within our previously guided range at 19.1% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President (Chubb Limited):\nAnd at this point, we're happy to take your questions."

And so I wanted to just have you talk a little bit more about this. Specifically, how is it affecting the coverages for casualty and general liability? Is it making it uninsurable? And I guess, how do you see the tort reform situation playing out because getting some sort of federal resolution seems to be challenging to say the least, and a state-by-state strategy for reform seems like it could take forever.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. So you got to separate two things. So let's not conflate. The two of us wrote that article. That was about public policy. And that was to flag an issue that people should be focused on for our country that is a problem. It impacts the cost of everything. It's inflationary. It impacts innovation and growth of business and continuity of businesses, litigation and the movement of cost, inflation around it, which runs at 7% to 9% every year, which is a multiple of what the nation runs as inflation, is roughly -- the total cost is roughly 2.5% of GDP and only a fraction of the $550 billion goes to the actual agreed party. And while litigation is an important function in a society based around laws, the trial bar and the litigation funding industry together are money-making ventures that are out of control. And we are pointing that out because I started by saying, don't conflate two things because the insurance industry and our job, we don't print money. We intermediate money."

Number three, auto insurer in Mexico, we've got 60 offices, thousands of agents to well over -- do over $1 billion of premium. And automobile in Mexico, important business to us, as you've known for, as we've said for years, growing well, small commercial, growing well, A&H growing well. Our digital business in Latin America, which show -- and our direct marketing, which shows up in Chile and in Brazil, we have important partnerships with the likes of new bank in Brazil and we're the exclusive partner, joint venture partner with Banco de Chile in Chile. Those businesses and our consumer business there, life and non-life, are growing quickly and doing quite well. Argentina as the country has improved, we've had a presence forever and Argentina in the commercial P&C business is growing. So our consumer business outpaced our commercial business in the quarter, it's enduring, and it's across -- it's not simply a trade, and it's across franchises that are moving through strength to strength with a lot of opportunity. It has a certain volatility signature to it. It's not smooth every quarter and quarter-to-quarter, but you measure it over any period of time. And we expect, depending on how the world goes, double-digit growth in Latin America continues over time.\n\nJian Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. No, that's really -- yes, double-digit growth going forward is pretty strong. Maybe if we can ask about -- this might be a little hypothetical. So administration has talked about potentially phasing out FEMA. And if that were to happen, does that have an impact on your high-net-worth business in the coastal states? Would you consider in partner with other insurers to write flood insurance business to support your high-net-worth book. Just curious if you have any thoughts there.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. Look, on FEMA on flood insurance provides a relatively modest limit. It's an important limit to the average consumer, but for high net worth, if you think of the values of their homes that you measure in the millions and FEMA gives you $0.25 million or so of coverage. While it's not something that you see that, it's not -- it doesn't move the needle. And the private flood market and Chubb is part of it has been growing. It's on a selective basis. with, frankly, better mapping and underwriting than FEMA's. So I don't see enough -- if FEMA phases out, I think it's bad for the country. I would restructure FEMA and how it provides coverage. I wouldn't provide the same coverage to the same individual to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild in the same flood zone, have multiple claims. On the other hand, as a first loss in flood for people who have no other choice from a social perspective, I would keep it."

I guess can you -- that would imply that, I guess, growth on the other 80% of the book where conditions are attractive, accelerated a bit. Maybe you could just touch on that, just the durability of the growth on that 80%, where conditions are a bit more attractive? And then maybe just talk about on the other 20%, your outlook there?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nThe pattern of growth ex that 20%. First of all, overall, the math is pretty simple. It's double-digit growth. And when you add it all together, commercial and consumer P&C, the pattern of growth is durable. And the pace of growth, as we can see, look forward is durable to us. The themes are durable. It's around middle market and small commercial. In the United States, we're the second largest middle market writer in the U.S. And between that and small commercial, the opportunity, and I've talked about it before, it's not just cyclical. It's secular to me, it's enduring. Our high-net-worth business, which has been growing rapidly and our margins from repricing and remodeling and all the work we did over about a 6-year period from '16 through '20, '21 quietly, has put us in such a solid position. And I expect that pattern to continue both growth and the kinds of margin that it has generated. When I look in Asia, and I look at the consumer businesses and the -- like Latin America, the digital distribution-related growth for consumer business on one hand and our growing agency auto business in selected countries on the other and on our direct marketing A&H and our travel insurance business is more people travel in the region. That pattern of growth and opportunity continues. And when I look at our middle market and small commercial because we are so deep in those markets, which is what it takes from Australia to Malaysia, Thailand, the Singapore, the Taiwan, I expect it to continue to expand. When I look at our powerhouse business in Korea, which is a direct marketing fundamentally, a direct marketing A&H business with a life [indiscernible]. I expect that growth to not only continue, I expect in time for that to accelerate and to do better. So throughout Asia, the themes of opportunity, commercial and consumer are enduring and they're in front of us like Latin America, the -- it's a region that has it's vast. It's much -- it's multiples the size of Latin America. And it has a certain volatility signature to it. So it isn't every quarter exactly the same or every year exactly the same. But as I look at it, it's where we're leaning in, and we see more opportunity. Our business in Europe, the same. It's not just a large commercial business and specialty. It is a middle market business, and it's expanding and growing more quickly in a variety of markets throughout. So overall, I look at this pattern of growth and I look at earnings, and I look at the stability of margin, and it all is about that diversification of the company. Our E&S business in the U.S., and I'm going to finish with this. We printed about a 5.6% growth. Property was negative. You look under the covers of that and the balance of lines of business from construction to casualty, both primary and excess, our pet insurance business are growing nicely.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nAnd then just a quick follow-up. Just in North America personal lines great to see another quarter of current accident year ex cat loss ratio improvement. Is that purely rate earning in over trend? Or was there anything else in there -- in the result that drove that improvement this quarter?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo, it's a combination. A rate over trend, it's over a period of time. I mean that's been iterative over years that has occurred. And I said it would drop over time into the 70s and that's what it's done. That's what it needs to do, given it's cat exposure. But it's that and it's underwriting shaping of the portfolio. We just grow more insightful. We have more tools available. And we have a greater knowledge and ability that's a standout of who we are in the high-net-worth business it's very complex underwriting. And the property exposures are very complicated. And our insight into underwriting and managing that stands out and we focus on that. Rate will never be enough to get you there. Underwriting doesn't equal rate. It equals risk selection and insight into risk engineering and managing the properties."

Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI think that's simplistic. Yes, the headline number, but that's why you peel it back. Casualty is ahead of loss cost trend. On the other hand, property right now is pricing is negative, and there is a more modest loss cost trend, but that loss cost trend is there. So one is going one way, one is going the other way. And on the other hand, we grew professional -- we grew financial lines this quarter, first time in most of our portfolios, not all, but most in quite a while. And in certain areas, we're beginning to get rate. And then I look at comp and comp pricing was better than the prior quarter. So there's puts and takes on it. And then as our mix of business changes. So you look at it, our loss ratio overall across the globe drop, North America loss ratio, commercial was flat. And that's a mix of business change occurring as well, more mid and small versus large and then within E&S, a shift. So I don't envision, as I look from what I see right now, the deterioration, as your mental model, if you do it too simplistically, I would imagine.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nAnd then second question, Evan, I'm just curious, and I think you've chatted about this a little bit in the past, a number of large health care insurance companies have had some issues with medical cost inflation. And I'm wondering how that could potentially affect the P&C insurance business Workers' Comp. How are you thinking about that in the context of Chubb?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. The medical inflation, remember, there's comp is different that way. And we have been careful, first of all, in our loss cost trend factors we used in reserving for medical, where we use factors that, frankly, are ahead of what we observed because it has a long tail to it. And by the idiosyncratic nature, what we see in health insurance companies, what drives the trend there in medical inflation is not the same factors that affect comp. And so we're not seeing it."

Is demand for more coverage, more deeper, broader coverage. Is that changing in response to elevated social inflation?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWell, they always like to buy deeper and broader coverage and have an arbit -- have a positive arbitrage with insurance companies. The trend has gone the other way. Over the last couple of years, last bunch of years on terms and conditions around casualty. It varies by area, obviously, particularly anything with logistics and automobile, trucking related, retail, slip and fall, et cetera. And those have been really the areas experiencing social inflation, which is true in middle market as well, separate from class actions around the chemical or something in the stream of commerce that way. Let's separate them out. Terms and conditions have tight retentions. I mean that's what I talked about for you'll recall for a multiyear period where we were reshaping the book and took a hit to revenue who cares because we were adjusting client retentions, which leaves more with them, no dollar swapping, while prices increased for the layers above the dollar swap because frequency and severity of loss is increasing and has been increasing. I think there's an equilibrium that is being achieved now where the terms and conditions and the pricing reflect and are keeping pace with what is a hostile liability environment. And so -- and there is that balance between client and carrier. But they make no bones about it. There's been more of a shift of risk. I'm back to client because why would you dollar swap? And then there has been inflation, extreme inflation and liability insurance premiums to reflect the risk that we are, in fact, taking. To a degree, you can't say that the middle market is immune from that at all. Case in point, I'll just point you to middle market commercial auto as a poster child for the last number of years, a bunch of years and a very difficult line for middle market carriers, and that's all about litigation social inflation. It's a poster child for it.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nSecond question, on the international side, is there any way of I guess, breaking down growth between market share gains of current products and adding more sophisticated insurance products to markets where the economy is developing, but where Chubb would presumably have less competition.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIt's a combination of both. we're driving in and gaining market share. There is, on one hand -- no, there's a third one in there. Number two, new insurance buyers, those economies are growing. So lots of new businesses and not just new businesses, but new industries as those economies develop. And so it's not -- where middle market may have been Main Street retail and restaurants and shop owners. It now expands as the economies develop. They have more technology-related and services-related businesses, et cetera, that develop with the economy on this people have more money. So it's new buyers, new industries and then you're adding product and locals don't happen. It could be from professional liability to cyber insurance to environmental liability to their change to more carbon neutral as those economies shift in new energy related industries, whether it's wind or solar, et cetera. So it's healthy dimensional when you look at it and it varies by market. There's not sort of one theme covering all of them. These are individual countries."

Is there a way to kind of tease out or estimate how much of that is attributed to litigation finance or social inflation more broadly is our way to kind of think about that?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIt's not an easy number to break out. But we do our own private work around that and information and our ability to measure where there is litigation, financing or not is growing, but it's still not clear. It's not transparent enough yet.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's fair. I appreciate, it's...\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWhat we can measure that I think, frankly, I want to help you with your question. It varies. What we can see very clearly, it varies by state to a very large degree. And that is the liability laws. We can measure how much comparative negligence as an example, depending on the law around comparative negligence. So I may be the only party in a suit that has money. And yet, I was only 15% liable. But in that state, I'm required to pay 100% of the loss, if no one else counts. And then comparative negligence between the claimant and the defense and the litigant -- what is comparative fault and how do you put dollar amounts around it. We can measure those things economically and know that this kind of law change in this place will have this kind of impact. And by the way, that's what's driving a Louisiana or a Florida or Georgia to tort reform.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nMaybe pivoting as my follow-up, the larger account property marketplace, which you gave good commentary on. Is there a way to think, perspectively, given the kind of extent of the pricing declines from a modeling perspective, would it be fair to say that if we have a normal catastrophe or lost year in the remainder of the year that this is kind of -- the worst would be behind us? Or is it just too tough to size up and we'll see what competitive dynamics do next year or later this year?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI'm sorry, Mike. For a moment, I blanked out on you because a colleague was telling me to mention noneconomic damages in the liability [indiscernible] which is another issue, and we can measure it. Were you talking about property insurance? And if we have the pricing...\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nYes. I guess just large account property, investors have asked us a lot of questions about just the extent of the price decrease...\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSo look, here is the mental model I want to give you, others who are listening about this. Large account buys large limits to the property. They break it up into these layers and it becomes simply a trading business, if you're not the one issuing the paper and managing the claims, and doing the engineering, and issuing policies all over the world for them, which most have no capability to do, Chubb does. And therefore, they throw the business in a dog bowl when there's so much capital that's hungry, and they eat layers out of the bowl. So they place it that way. London and a number of other carriers, whether it is E&S related or it's admitted related come to play and you get this frenzy when there's too much capital, please give me a share because it looks well for us. It responds over time to loss cost, both [indiscernible] underprice it. And we're not -- we're on the edge of that right now. And they -- and so it will respond to major catastrophes, it will respond to frequency of attritional loss that will occur over time. And whether it is in one season will depend on how major the cats are and how many of them are and where are they? So not a simple answer, but ultimately, in the business. You got to get an adequate price to make any money in. Economics don't change, just a timing question."

Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you, and welcome to our September 30, 2025 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter. In fact, a record earnings quarter. Core operating income of $3 billion was up 29%, leading to EPS of $7.49 per share, up 31% from a year ago, both supported by record underwriting and investment results as well as solid premium revenue growth. The results put a point on the broad-based and diversified nature of our company geographically, by customer segment and by product area. Most of our businesses in regions of the world contributed. Geographically, that means North America, Asia, Latin America and U.K., Europe. When I say customer segments that contributed strong growth this quarter, that means globally, both consumer, homeowners and auto, specialty personal lines, life and international A&H. When I say commercial P&C, particularly middle market and small commercial, our E&S business, crop insurance and a broad range of large account casualty and financial lines. And growth was generated by numerous distribution sources, brokerage, agency, phone-based direct marketing and digital. In short, a wide variety of diverse businesses and geographies that are contributing to growth globally. Our balance of business and presence, about half U.S. and half outside provides a wide range of opportunities, which supports long-term profitable growth. Importantly, it also supports our ability to manage the commercial P&C cycle with discipline, something we are well known for doing. We expect to continue generating superior margin and earnings growth and, in fact, an increase to our return on shareholder equity. In the quarter, record underwriting income on both a published and current accident year ex-cat basis was supported, of course, by a quiet cat quarter. But more importantly, by current underwriting year margin improvement and strong prior period development. Published underwriting income of $2.3 billion was up 55% from a year ago, with a record combined ratio of 81.8%, about 6 percentage points better than a year earlier. Though cat losses were light in the quarter, rest assured, catastrophe risk is alive, well and obviously, by definition, volatile. Remember, the California wildfires first quarter and convective storm activity through much of the year. Cat volatility aside, our underlying underwriting results were simply excellent in the quarter. Current accident year underwriting income, excluding cats, was a record $2.2 billion, up 10%, supported by a combined ratio of 82.5%, nearly a full point improvement from prior year, with most all of it coming from loss ratio improvement. On the invested asset side, for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was a record $1.8 billion, up 8.3%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5.1%, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.2%. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was quite strong at $4.5 billion, which is contributing to strong growth in our invested asset, which is up nearly 10% over the last 12 months. Current fiscal, financial and economic conditions favor attractive fixed income and alternative asset portfolio returns for our growing invested asset. Federal budget deficits, inflation and rotation from the dollar support what we believe will be a steeper yield curve as we look to the future, which in turn should support our reinvestment rates and future investment income growth. Tangible book value growth, our primary measure of wealth creation, was 17% per share from a year ago and 6.6% from the previous quarter. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 24.5%, simply an outstanding result. Peter is going to have more to say about financial items in a couple of minutes. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Total company premiums grew 7.5%, with consumer up almost 16% and commercial up 3.3%. Commercial P&C growth this quarter was impacted by 2 items that benefited North America last year. Our underlying renewable commercial P&C business grew about 5.5%, which is more representative of our run rate. Premiums in our Life Insurance division grew over 24.5%. In terms of the commercial P&C underwriting environment, I would characterize the market globally as in transition. Competition continues to grow, especially large account-related short-tail business, both admitted and E&S. A lot more capital is chasing the property business and prices are softening, while terms and conditions remain steady. On the other hand, middle market and small commercial property is more disciplined and orderly, though greater competition is beginning to show as expected, particularly in upper middle market. In mid-market, property rates continue to rise, but naturally at a slower pace. Casualty pricing overall, large account, E&S and middle market is also slowing, though it continues to firm in the areas that require rate. It's quite rational. Financial lines remain soft, but we're seeing signs of firming in discrete classes. I'll give you some more color by division. For a change, let's begin this quarter with our international business. Premiums in our Overseas General division were up 9.7% or nearly 7.5% in constant dollars. Consumer was up 15.5% and commercial lines grew nearly 6%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia grew over 14%. Europe grew almost 5% and Latin America grew over 10.5%. Consumer lines grew more than 25% in Asia and more than 12.5% in Latin America. Premiums in our London wholesale business were up over 8.5%. Our international retail and E&S business again illustrates the power of Chubb diversification. In our international retail commercial business, P&C rates were down 1.3% and financial lines rates were down over 8%. Turning to North America. Total P&C premiums were up 4.4%, including over 8% in personal lines and 3.5% growth in commercial. Adjusting for the 2 nonrecurring items we wrote last year that did not repeat this year, renewable premiums in our North America commercial business grew 6.2%, with P&C lines up 5.8% and financial lines up almost 8.5%. Drilling down, our North America high net worth personal lines business generated more than $1.8 billion in net written premium for the quarter. This business is now almost as large as our North America middle market and major accounts commercial businesses, each with premiums in the quarter of $2.1 billion, again, illustrating our comp"

This business is now almost as large as our North America middle market and major accounts commercial businesses, each with premiums in the quarter of $2.1 billion, again, illustrating our company's diversification. Premium growth for our true high net worth segments was about 11.5%. On the commercial P&C side in North America, premiums in our middle market business, we're the second largest writer in the U.S. grew 4.1% to $2.1 billion. Middle market workers' comp growth was impacted by one of the 24-year items I mentioned, namely an annual retrospective premium exposure adjustment. We make it -- which we make every year in the third quarter. That benefited us much less this year than last. Adjusting for that, we grew middle market almost 7% with P&C lines up 8.6% and financial lines flat. Premiums in Major Accounts and Specialty grew 2.5%, with major up 3.2% and E&S up 6.6%. The Major Accounts division was up 5.6% adjusting for the impact of a large one-off LPT written last year. In North America Commercial, we had a very good quarter for new business. It was up 24% versus prior year, with double-digit growth in major specialty, middle market and Small Commercial. Our renewal retention rate on a policy count basis was over 86%. Commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding financial lines and comp was up 4.3%, with rates up 2.4% and exposure change of 1.9%. Property pricing was flat with rates down 3.3% and exposure change of 3.5% and going a step further, property pricing was down 13.5% in large account business in E&S and up 6.2% in Middle Market and Small Commercial. Casualty pricing in North America was up 8% with rates up 7.5% and exposure up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down almost 2%. And with workers' comp, primary comp pricing was flat, while large account risk management pricing was up almost 5%. In North America Commercial, there was no change to our selected loss cost trends. In our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 26.5%. We had a large onetime premium in New Zealand and adjusting for that, growth was up just over 16.5%. In North America, combined insurance company premiums were up 18%. Our Life division produced $324 million of pretax income in the quarter, up over 14%. Chubb's fundamentals and our positioning are excellent. We're performing at a high level, almost anywhere you look in the company. We have broad global diversification and a disciplined, energized and talented team of professionals, whom I couldn't be more proud of to call my colleagues. We are reaping results and planting seeds for the future. Our digital and AI efforts, years in the making are contributing to growth and beginning to transform the company and how we do business. Our balance sheet, starting with loss reserves has never been stronger. We estimate that 70% to 80% of our businesses present attractive growth opportunities. And looking forward from all we can see, our performance is enduring. We will maintain superior earnings growth, including double-digit growth in EPS, book and tangible book value and core operating ROE increasing to 14-plus percent over the medium term. In the quarter, we stepped up share buybacks because we are an excellent investment with our stock trading well below intrinsic value. Increased buyback activity will continue, while at the same time, we will continue to build additional capital and our invested assets. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter now, and then we're going to come back and take questions.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nGood morning. As you have just heard, we had another strong quarter that produced 9-month records in our 3 primary sources of earnings. Our results were supported by $4.5 billion of adjusted operating cash flows and exceptional balance sheet strength, including all-time highs in both book value of nearly $72 billion and cash and invested assets that exceeded $168 billion. There are a few capital-related matters I'd like to touch on. First, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $385 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. Secondly, we issued approximately $2.2 billion of debt at a weighted average cost of 4% and an average term of about 12 years. Book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively, for the quarter and 10.4% and 14.8% from the prior year. Our core operating return on tangible equity and core operating ROE were 24.5% and 16.3%, respectively, for the quarter. Pretax catastrophe losses were $285 million for the quarter, principally from weather-related events split 86% U.S. and 14% international, and $2.6 billion through 9 months versus $1.8 billion over the same period last year. Pretax prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was favorable $422 million, comprising $460 million of favorable development in short-tail lines and $38 million of unfavorable development in long-tail lines. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $61 million, mostly environmental related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 83% and 87% year-to-date. Turning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio, which had an average book yield of 5.1% for the quarter, increased over $7.5 billion from the prior quarter. The increase reflects strong operating cash flow as well as positive mark-to-market and favorable FX, partially offset by shareholder distributions. Adjusted net investment income was $1.78 billion, which was above our previously guided range by approximately $40 million due to higher-than-projected private equity income as well as higher call premium and strong cash flows into the portfolio. To give you a bit more color this quarter, approximately 87% of investment income was generated by our fixed income portfolio, which is relatively predictable and growing steadily. The balance of our investment income is from private investments and other sources, which while growing more quickly are more variable from quarter-to-quarter. We now expect adjusted net investment income in the fourth quarter to be between $1.775 billion and $1.81 billion next quarter. International Life premiums written growth in the quarter of 26.5% included a favorable onetime large transaction of $126 million, without which growth would have been 16.6%. The contribution from this transaction to Life Insurance segment income was de minimis. Our core operating effective tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, which is above our previously guided range due to shifts in mix of income by tax jurisdiction, in particular, related to prior period development and catastrophe losses. As a result, we expect our core operating effective tax rate for this full year to be in the range of 19.5% to 20%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (Chubb Limited):\nThank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

But just -- Evan, just had a question on the ROE outlook increase to 14% plus from 13% in December. I guess, can you just talk through the moving pieces there and where you see upside that incremental point? Is it net investment income, underwriting, either releases or underlying underwriting, all of the above? Could you just help me think through the moving pieces there?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I'll help you think it through conceptually, not a worksheet. Look, we -- and I think this is the place where I start the mental model here. And it's 14 plus, by the way. The plus is an important sign. We have strong and growing earning power. And as we look forward, we see that enduring. It's growing earnings. And there are 3 engines of it. And so you keep a mental model of that, underwriting, life income and our invested asset and so investment income. The growth in underwriting, it's commercial and consumer P&C, it's very broad-based in non-life, including A&H. Our life earning power growing, our invested asset and alternative allocation to alternatives. So investment income growing. Each of those, as we look forward, we see good sustainability to growth of earnings. And then -- with growth of earnings, it means our capital base, obviously, with those earnings growth and that earning power, capital continues to grow. We're trading well as we see it below intrinsic value. And by the way, as you continue to grow earnings and if it's sustainable, then frankly, your intrinsic value continues to move out. We will buy back above previous trend. As you saw this quarter, we will continue to do that. And at the same time, we're going to continue to build our invested asset that also contributes to growth of earning power. That's as simple as I believe I can break it down for you.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up, excess capital, I think in the past, you guys have talked about it as a drag on the ROE. I guess how can we think about that today? I think last time you spoke about it, it was, I think, a 2-point drag. Any way you could size that today for us?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. Everybody migrates, me too. And I don't really view it as excess capital because we're earning -- it's accretive to ROE as we deploy it on the invested asset side to the degree that it isn't supporting insurance underwriting activity. That's what you'll think of as surplus capital. But we're generating an excellent return on the alternative side, in particular, as we grow that in our invested asset. And the -- so I more think of it that way. But to answer your point directly, it's 2 points or north of 2 points."

And so I was looking for some more color on that. And I guess why I'm a little bit surprised by it is because there's all this talk about pricing pressure among the large multinational types of exposures and in E&S market, it seems like your business, whether it's London wholesale or the commercial inside overseas general is performing -- outperforming the peer group. So maybe you can shed some color on that.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I want to correct your mental model, I think the majority -- the vast majority of our overseas general business -- so P&C is not E&S, and it is not large account multinational. The majority of it is middle market, small commercial and consumer business, personal lines, automobile, homeowners, depending on the territory you're in, we do it selectively, and we talk about it. A&H business, digitally derived, direct marketing, agency, brokerage, vast in Asia, big in Latin America. And in the U.K. and on the continent, our business is well diversified, middle market, in particular, and large account. Large account businesses fundamentally when you get down to it, U.K., parts of the continent, Australia. But that's a better mental model than the one you start with, which is most of the neighborhood that you talk to, which is crowded in London and writing shared and layered trades in E&S and then large multinational. And in that business, it's property that is most competitive, which is where the globe is moving in a similar direction, large account shared and layered, but beginning to show up in parts of the middle market. It's property. And where I -- when I have any concern about underpricing of business at the moment, it's particularly in parts of that area of property. The balance, particularly in most casualty lines, is adequately priced or where it's not the market is responding with pricing and to achieve adequacy. Financial lines bumps around the bottom, so buyer beware.\n\nCharles Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGreat. I guess the second question unrelated but important is just around the expense ratio. If I look at the year-to-date results on the PC consolidated policy acquisition ratio is up a little bit. Maybe the admin administrative expense ratio is holding in line. But I'm just curious what the moving parts are.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, yes. The acquisition is simply is just mix of business, more middle market, small and consumer lines, they run a more favorable loss ratio."

Just from where you're sitting, like on the commercial side globally, in what ways are you seeing the macro impact your business, if at all?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. There's a wildcard. Right now, interesting enough, I'm not seeing a big impact to the macro. U.S. is doing well. So overall, the economy, you can't get away from me. You look at the numbers. Overall, U.S. economy has remained strong, though labor is slowing down and the growth of payroll is slowing. And that's what you saw in the sort of that workers' comp adjustment, once a year adjustment to payroll numbers. So you see that show up. Europe is slow in economic growth, but it's been slow and it continues slow. Asia stands up -- has stood up pretty well. It varies by country within Asia, but it stood up reasonably well. Korea is slow right now, but it isn't really impacting the growth of our business too much because of the nature of our kind of products and our distribution. But Thailand is impacted on one hand. On another hand, as Singapore does well. Australia doing quite well economically. So it varies across the board. It's a little volatile, but I don't notice a big impact."

So I'd just be curious if you have any comments or color in that regard.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nWe must be talking to different people because, frankly, I haven't noticed that kind of chatter or many sellers in Asia. Most seem to be happy to make a go of it. So I'm not noticing that. I know one thing, I got a dance card that's pretty full. Our plate is very full with organic growth opportunities across consumer, across small, mid, in particular, commercial, variety of distribution and a whole lot of countries. So we're just flat out busy growing organically right now and building capability and reaping what we got. So I haven't really noticed much of that, Matt.\n\nMatthew Heimermann - Analyst (Citi):\nRight. I appreciate that. The other question I have is, if you're willing to entertain it is -- there's been a lot of chatter about a particular historically wholesale broker moving into the U.S. organically on the retail side and some big shifts of business away from them, in particular, in the London wholesale market. I'm just curious, from a health of the market, drawing regulatory scrutiny and maybe it's just my institutional memory is too long, should we be worried about that type of behavior?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nNo. I wouldn't. It speaks to a market economy. People make choices. They have their own choice to make. I'm not going to second guess their own analysis and the strategic outcome of that. That broker is doing what they're doing with their eyes wide open, I assume. And they look at the positive and they look at the negative, and they must see that the positives outweigh the negative. That's their choice to make. And it's every other broker's choice to react. I'm glad there isn't regulation that somehow impacts the ability of market to make rational choices each on their own. Let's have a dynamic market. And by the way, a dynamic market is, by definition, messier."

Our industry practices business, we are the pioneers, the inventors of the notion of industry practice that some others are trying to copy, where we offer product and suites of product with wordings designed by industry. It's not just marketing, it's true underwriting and product differentiation in the various customer cohorts because we break down the middle market by industry and specialize across a wide swath of industries targeting customers in those industries. We segment the middle market between large and sort of middle and then lower middle market, which is a different buyer than the balance of middle market. It's more akin to small commercial and the ability to take the seams out and deliver to customer, whether they're small or lower middle and in a totally digital way and to have the broadest suite of products so that you meet all of the customers' needs that way, growing marketing capability to be able to segment by geography, where are the customers that we are most compelling for, we have the best offering the growing ability of our software with our people to deliver in that and to do it in a way that drives not just more submission activity, but at a close ratio that is superior, that is what Chubb's middle market and small commercial in a nutshell is about, and that is spreading around the globe."

I know it's been seeing some declining revenues here year-to-date and in the quarter. What's going on with the business?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes, perfect. It was North America that declined. We had a -- and it's not a dog ate my homework. We had a very large customer that we couldn't come to terms with. The underwriting just simply the pricing wasn't going to meet our standard. And so we mutually agreed to part ways on that. And that was the end of last year, and that's impacted A&H in North America all year, in fact. It's a one-off. Internationally, the business is growing at around 7.5%. Asia, in particular, and Latin America, and it's growing and the opportunity is in a number of areas. Our travel-related business is growing quickly because it's 100% digital. And our ability to deliver through airlines on an embedded basis or through large travel agencies and an improvement of product and even being able to settle claims on a digital basis has given us a lot of runway in that. Our direct marketing business, not just by phone, but by a digital direct-to-consumer through, as I've talked about repeatedly, we have over 200 platform partners, but some very large ones like a Nubank in Latin America or Grab in Asia or a ByteDance, et cetera, to their customers through both an embedded and now what we call click to engage or click to call where we marry up voice and direct digital together to be able to sell a higher average ticket product. It's a very vibrant strategy with a lot of growth runway to it both non-life, which is what you see disclosed there. And on the life side, we'll remember, 60% to 70% of our business is A&H. So when I look at it going forward, I think about growth in Asia, Latin America, both growth regions, Europe, more flattish. North America, we see growth picking up. And then to remind you, when I say the combined was up 18%, that's worksite marketing. And most of that is A&H and then some risk-based life insurance. But it's dread disease, it's hospital cash. So again, that's another proxy of A&H business. We love A&H business around here for decades.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nAnd the second question, maybe you could talk a little bit about the reinsurance business. Obviously, a big decline in premium this quarter. What are you seeing in that marketplace? Are you seeing terms and conditions loosening up? And any crystal ball as to what do you think 1/1 may look like?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI like it as a buyer. Look, our reinsurance business, and you know this, we've always run it a bit as a -- we get the joke. We recognize it more as a trade. And frankly, it's the other side of that same coin of property softening. And we're not going to chase property cat unless we really like -- unless we think it's priced adequately, and we're disciplined about price model. There is no sort of gut feel or I observe 1 or 2 quarters where cat activity was light, so something has changed, Oh my God, please. And so we're disciplined about it, and we will write the business when we're going to get paid adequately, and we will shrink when we're not. And there is a pretty good example."

Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nI'm sorry, say that again.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nSo Peter mentioned that non-fixed income -- investment income is more volatile, but growing faster than the fixed income component. And I was just hoping to dig a little deeper in terms of what you're thinking and maybe where that goes over time.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. I'm going to give it to Peter in a second, but let's be very careful of more volatile. It's not more volatile in its signature. It's just a question of realized gains versus interest rate income off of a fixed -- so fixed versus equity base. That's all. But go ahead, Peter.\n\nPeter Enns - Chief Financial Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSo we had indicated before that we're increasing our allocation to private investments, including private equity, and those have -- so we're increasing the allocation and those also have a higher current yield. So just on that basis alone, that income will grow more quickly over time. To Evan's point, there'll be quarterly fluctuations from things like distributions and realizations. But the current return off that, that will flow through our adjusted NII is higher, plus the total IRR is much higher, and that will help book value compound more quickly.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nSo think of alternatives as producing -- and we've said this before, we used our partnership with our long-term partnership with KKR as an example. It will feed a coupon yield of, let's call it, somewhere around 7%, 7.5%. But on the other hand, it has an IRR to it of 15% plus in that range. So therefore, it does have a terminal value component to it also. And that's -- and you see that fluctuation as you do normally in PV.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. One quick other question. We've had 2 consecutive quarters in North America Personal with really solid top line growth and declining administrative expenses on a year-over-year basis. Is that something that can persist? Is that technology driven?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):"

We have built a culture, a discipline and an ability to monitor and survey our discipline and the way we work at an extremely granular level on a real-time basis.

The people who embrace this, the management team, we've been together some 15 years, some 20 years, some 25 years. We've been together decades. We've all grown up with the same ethos of how do you run and discipline and manage a business. And we're fundamental builders. We love what we do. And so it's granular. You look at the results, but it's the result of those macro results of granular effort across hundreds of businesses in dozens of countries with a management structure that can discipline and drive it on a daily basis. And we are all traveling and on the ground tirelessly to examine and know our businesses. We love it. We love what we do. And frankly, I've been asked this question of enduring, and that's why I started with it for over 20 years. How are you guys going to keep repeating it? And by the way, you can lose it. You can lose it quickly if you start laying back or getting a little complacent or starting to believe your own stuff that is written about you that you're so great. We're not.

If I look at just the simple DuPont kind of analysis, it would suggest that, that ROE drag, whether you want to call it excess capital or just lower premium to equity than maybe you could run with. That seems like the biggest opportunity to increase the ROE quicker, but that wasn't where you went at first with that response. So I was interested in that. I mean, do you feel like -- you feel like there are things you can do on underwriting life income, growing the business? Like do you feel like you can hit that 14% ROE plus without any contemplation of really hammering the buyback or doing inorganic or something like that?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nCorrect. Yes, correct. We're going to -- from all we see, we're going to continue to grow income. I gave you the parts and pieces of growing income, which is growing earning power. We will continue to build our invested asset, and we will continue to -- with that income, not just loss reserves.

Just interested in your views on how you think that would be impacted, if at all, if we see competition heating up and maybe areas of the market where that has more of an impact like direct-to-consumer, et cetera?\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nYes. And I think you're referring to high net worth North America? Or are you thinking globally? Or what do you think...\n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nYes, more in North America.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Chubb Limited):\nIn North America, I mean, look, competition. It takes -- what is competition really about? We have competitors out there who sell at a price significantly below Chubb. And if you are a Chubb customer, and we respect our customers, but if price becomes a real problem for you, then we have 2 or 3 other phone numbers we'll give you of others who will sell it at a price below us. But it's about service. It's about the richness of product. Anybody who has a claim with Chubb that I know of I mean there's our reputation, never leaves. Our ability in risk engineering and again, the richness of the coverage we offer. So it's not just claims service in terms of speed and how we deal with the customer, but it's how the richness of that coverage comes alive at that time. It's our broad reach and appetite. We can underwrite a customer anywhere they are for any kind of home they're in. We offer the broadest range of coverages from their fine arts and jewelry to large limits of casualty to yachts and boats anywhere in the world. No one steps up to this. We do define the class, yet we're hungry and we're humble about it. We keep stepping up to reinforce and rebuild ourselves. Competition is heating up as it heats up more in cat -- extreme cat concentrated areas. We can't write it all. I'm not going to try to dominate in any area where, oh, I wrote 100% of the cat market here. Are you kidding me? So there's room for others to come on in and write your share. And by the way, you can write it at an adequate risk-adjusted price. Don't worry. And so competition wanes and waxes in it. It's more about the price in that case, but not the richness of coverage and service that we provide. It's such an enduring franchise, and I couldn't be more proud of it. And I couldn't be a bigger fan."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provided details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.  Additionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.  Finally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics, with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Tuesday, May 9.   With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more financial detail in the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.  As you saw in our press release, we reported an excellent start to the year. We continue to make meaningful progress across AIG and achieve important milestones, even in the face of ongoing complexity in the insurance industry, volatile market conditions and general economic uncertainty. We continue to diligently execute on our strategic and operational priorities, which drove very strong financial results in the first quarter and are positioning AIG for long-term value creation. Here are some highlights from the first quarter.  Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Net investment income on a consolidated basis was $3.1 billion. In 2022, we began to take proactive steps to improve the credit quality, construction and return characteristics of our investment portfolio as well as to reduce volatility. We saw the benefits of these actions in the first quarter and expect that to continue throughout the year. Sabra will provide additional detail on net investment income in her remarks.  Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 10% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination that we discussed on our last call. This growth was driven by our Commercial business. Underwriting income was approximately $500 million, a 13% increase year-over-year, which is AIG's strongest first quarter underwriting result.  The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement from prior year.  Life and Retirement reported very good results, with premiums and deposits of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a 44% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products.  Net flows into the General Account from Individual Retirement were approximately $1.3 billion.  Corebridge and Blackstone have made substantial progress advancing their strategic partnership, which began in late 2021. Since that time, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on behalf of Corebridge, with an average gross yield of 6.5% and an average credit rating of A. This partnership has allowed Corebridge to expand in certain asset classes where we had limited to no access in the past, which has been very beneficial for the business and is helping to support growth, particularly in fixed annuity products.  We returned approximately $840 million to shareholders in the first quarter through $600 million of common stock repurchases and $240 million of dividends. And we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $3.9 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. The strong momentum we had coming into 2023 continues.  As we announced last night, the AIG Board approved the first meaningful increase to AIG's common stock quarterly dividend in many years. Starting in the second quarter, this dividend will be $0.36 per share, an increase of 12.5%. This is another significant milestone for AIG and reflects our commitment to a disciplined, balanced capital management strategy and our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG.  Corebridge is also achieving important milestones. Since its IPO in September of last year, Corebridge has paid 3 dividends to public shareholders, totaling approximately $450 million. And yesterday, the Corebridge Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we were prepared to launch a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock, but chose not to proceed when equity markets became volatile due to issues in the financial sector.  We continue to be prepared and disciplined in terms of executing a secondary offering, which remains our base case for selling down our ownership in Corebridge, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. We remain committed to reducing our ownership interest in Corebridge and will explore other options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.\n\n During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I'll provide more information on the following 5 topics - Unclear, likely Peter Zaffino (Chairman and CEO) (AIG):\nfirst, I will review the first quarter results for General Insurance; second, I will give a high-level overview of the results for Life and Retirement, and Sabra will provide more detail in her remarks; third, I will provide an update on a few strategic initiatives, including the announcement last week relating to Private Client Services, our MGA partnership with Stone Point Capital, our announcement on Tuesday of the sale of Crop Risk Services and our intent to sell Laya Healthcare, which is a part of Corebridge and Ireland's second largest health insurance provider; fourth, I will provide more information on capital management actions; lastly, I will review progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, including an update on the work we are doing on the future state business model of AIG.  Turning to General Insurance. Let me provide more detail on first quarter results, starting with our strong growth in gross and net premiums written. When we refer to gross and net premiums written, all numbers have been adjusted for both foreign exchange and the impact of the lag elimination.  Gross premiums written were $12 billion, an increase of 9%, with Global Commercial growing 13% and Global Personal decreasing 4%. Net premiums written were $7 billion, an increase of 10%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Commercial, which grew 11%, while Global Personal grew 6%.  In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 15% in net premiums written due to Validus Re, which had over 40% growth year-over-year due to the exceptional results we achieved with our January 1 treaty placements, which I discussed in detail on our last call. Lexington, which grew over 25%, led by Wholesale Property and Casualty, double-digit growth in Captive "

      "raw_bytes": " we achieved with our January 1 treaty placements, which I discussed in detail on our last call. Lexington, which grew over 25%, led by Wholesale Property and Casualty, double-digit growth in Captive Solutions and Glatfelter.  Focusing on Lexington for a moment, I would like to highlight a few achievements from the first quarter. The business continues to drive excellent performance, impressive growth and has consistently improved its portfolio quarter after quarter over the last couple of years. Lexington's tremendous growth has been achieved through its relevance in the marketplace and increasing its market share, not from increasing limits deployed. Strong retention, new business and rate have been the key drivers of Lexington's financial performance. Lexington has now seen double-digit rate increases for 16 consecutive quarters, and cumulative compounded rate increases totaled over 100% since the first quarter of 2018.  Additionally, over the last few years, the average size of a Lexington Property primary policy went from $100 million in limits deployed to $5 million. This has substantially reduced volatility in Lexington's portfolio. Our thoughtful and prudent growth strategy, together with our shift in focus to wholesale distribution, continues to serve us well, particularly in the E&S market.  I also want to provide more color on Validus Re. We've provided significant detail on the 1/1 renewal season on our last call, and I think it's worth expanding on a few items from the first quarter. Net premiums written were very strong and balanced in Validus Re, and we continue to meaningfully improve the quality of the portfolio. Rate improvements were particularly strong in U.S. Property, International Property, Marine and Energy, Casualty and Specialty Lines.  With respect to April 1 renewals across the portfolio, gross and net premiums written increased. And within International Property, limits deployed were reduced slightly, and Japan property cat risk-adjusted rates were up approximately 20%.  As we consider our deployment strategy at the June 1 renewal cycle, which focuses on U.S. wind exposure, we will continue to maintain a prudent approach on limits deployed. We do not expect to deploy additional limits beyond our current aggregate allocated to Florida, although we do anticipate significant rate increases and improved terms and conditions. Like General Insurance, the Validus Re portfolio has been completely re-underwritten with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. The business had a terrific first quarter and is well positioned for profitable growth through the rest of the year.  Shifting back to our 15% net premiums written growth in the first quarter, this result was impressive despite the headwinds we continue to see in Financial Lines, where overall net premiums written contracted 9% due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing as well as continued slowdown in M&A and other transactional business.  We are one of the very few lead markets in large account public D&O where primary rates have remained relatively flat year-over-year. In contrast, high excess public company D&O saw rate declines greater than 20%. To put this in perspective, this represents a little over 5% of our overall North America Financial Lines business, and we will continue to manage this book very prudently. We have deep domain knowledge and experience, data, best-in-class underwriting capabilities and leading claims expertise that allow us to differentiate ourselves in the D&O marketplace.  During the past year, we continued to see new competitors with limited experience into the high excess public D&O market. This is driving down pricing in what is traditionally the most commoditized portion of a placement. Despite these dynamics, we remain disciplined on price and are taking a long-term view of this line of business. We have significant scale and geographic balance on our portfolio, and we will not follow the market down.  Turning to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 6%, primarily due to Property, which was up over 40%; Global Specialty, which was up over 15%; and Casualty, which was up over 15%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio, International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 100 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was over $1 billion in the first quarter.  International Commercial new business was over $590 million, led by Specialty, which increased its new business by over 50%, driven by Energy and Marine. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, achieved new business of over $480 million, driven by Lexington, which saw excellent new business growth of over 50%. With respect to rate in North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rates increased 7% in the first quarter or 8% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%.  In North America Commercial, rate was driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 26% with Wholesale Property up 35%. For Lexington Property Wholesale, this was its strongest quarterly rate increase. Rate in Retail Property was also up significantly at 32%; International Commercial rate increases were 8%, driven by Talbot at 16%, International Property at 11% and Specialty at 9%. The exposure increase in the International portfolio was 2%. Rate plus exposure remains above loss cost trend at 9% in North America, 10% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International.   Turning to Personal Insurance. First quarter results reflect our continued repositioning of this business, especially PCG, given our announcement of the creation of a managing general agency in partnership with Stone Point Capital. I will provide more information on the MGA later in my remarks.  North America Personal net premiums written increased 57%, driven by lower quota share cessions in PCG at January 1, as we transition to writing the business as an MGA, along with the recognition of an improved portfolio. The combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitting market has a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy or loss ratios. This will earn in through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.  Entering 2023, we required less excess of loss reinsurance on the upper end of our reinsurance program due to realized reduction in PCG's PMLs at all return periods as a result of ongoing improvements in risk selection and reductions in aggregate in peak zones. More specifically, all peril and all return periods from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 reduced on average by 40%, while those same return periods with respect to wildfire reduced on average by 60%. These dynamics further impacted net premiums written in the first quarter.   Syndicate 2019 continues to act as a mechanism to enable third-party capital providers to support PCG's high and ultra-high net worth business for the 2023 accident year.  In terms of expectations for PCG for the full year, we expect net premiums written growth to be at or higher than we saw in the first quarter, the loss ratio to meaningfully improve and the acquisition ratio and general operating expense to also improve.  Turning to International Personal. Net premiums written were largely flat in the first quarter, Travel and Warranty grew while Personal Property declined, all driven by a further refinement of our cat reinsurance cost allocation methodology, making year-over-year comparisons difficult. Accident & Health had some timing issues that impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. We expect to see growth in International Personal for the remainder of 2023 and believe results will continue to strengthen as we move through the year.  Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, "

As I noted earlier, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.9%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year and we reported a 24% increase in underwriting income.  The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 85.7%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was essentially flat at 83.7%, which is an outstanding result. Global Personal reported a first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 98.6%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium from our deliberate reduction in gross exposure in PCG in North America.  Now let me comment on catastrophes. The cat loss ratio in the quarter was 4.2% or $264 million of catastrophe losses. Our largest loss in the period was from 2 storms in New Zealand, which accounted for $126 million of catastrophe losses.  Looking at North America, total losses from catastrophe-related activities in the first quarter were $116 million, which includes Validus Re. In International, excluding Japan, we have eroded approximately $75 million of our aggregate retention and have approximately $75 million net remaining, plus the annual aggregate deductible for each cat loss for the rest of the year. As we described in our last call, the reinsurance program we structured at this year's January 1 renewal provides us with the ability to manage volatility and severity. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, we expect to see very strong top line growth in General Insurance.  Turning to Life and Retirement. The business delivered strong performance in the first quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $886 million for the first quarter, and adjusted return on segment equity was 10.7%. First quarter results benefited from continued growth in spread-based products and related spread income. As I mentioned earlier, premiums and deposits grew significantly in the first quarter, driven by strong new individual retirement business, which, despite increasing surrenders related to interest rates, contributed to growth in the General Account. The balance sheet and capital position of Corebridge remains strong with $1.8 billion of parent liquidity.  Turning to our strategic initiatives. Last week, we executed a definitive documentation with Stone Point Capital for the launch of Private Client Services, an MGA that will serve the high and ultra-high net worth market. We are excited about the prospects for PCS and are confident of the value this new operating structure will deliver for clients, brokers and other stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this journey with the PCS management team and the ongoing support of Stone Point Capital.  Subject to regulatory approvals, the MGA is expected to formally launch in the third quarter of this year, and we expect to bring on additional capital providers through the second half of 2023. As part of our ongoing review process, we regularly assess the composition of our portfolio of businesses to ensure it is aligned with our long-term strategy and best positioned to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.  As part of this review, as you saw in our announcement on Tuesday, we executed a definitive documentation to sell Crop Risk Services, or CRS, to American Financial Group for $240 million. We acquired CRS as part of our broader acquisition of Validus Holdings in 2018. AIG will continue to write business for the 2023 spring crop season, which ends June 30. We expect approximately $700 million to $800 million of net premiums written for 2023, 75% of which booked in the first quarter. Starting in the third quarter, AIG will act as a fronting partner for American Financial Group during a transitional period.  For full year 2023, we expect to retain about $800 million to $900 million of earned premiums, $750 million of which we'll earn in over the remainder of the year. CRS is a well-run and attractive business, led by a high-quality management team. In American Financial Group, we have found a high-quality partner for CRS and its employees and believe the business will benefit from being part of a larger combined platform. We also continually review the product portfolio and geographic footprint of Corebridge as we position this business for the future as a fully stand-alone company.  After a comprehensive review of the health product offering, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland. We believe this will help to streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow it to focus on Life and Retirement products and solutions.  Turning to capital management. The first quarter marked another quarter of continued progress and execution of our balanced strategy. In addition to the first quarter share repurchases and dividends that I mentioned earlier, against the backdrop of an unstable macroeconomic environment, we thought it was prudent to raise $750 million of debt at the end of March. This provided us with financial flexibility to pay down a near-term debt maturity and complete additional share repurchases at what we viewed as attractive share prices.  Turning to return on common equity. We remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE. Through the first quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on the 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these components include sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. Given the number of strategic initiatives we are executing at once, we are taking a long-term view while measuring progress in 90-day increments. We advanced each component during the first quarter and expect this to continue throughout 2023.  As I discussed earlier, our first quarter financial results were excellent, with continued top line growth and improvement in underwriting profitability in General Insurance. Over the last few months, we accelerated our work to establish AIG's future state business model. Sequencing has been very important on our journey and the work that's been accomplished over the last few years on the General Insurance turnaround, AIG 200, the separation and IPO of Corebridge and restructuring of our investment management group. This has positioned us to move forward as a more focused and simplified AIG.  Evolving our future state business model will result in us moving away from the conglomerate structure AIG operated in for decades. We will eliminate overlap and significantly reduce decentralized infrastructure across the company, which will lead to a leaner business model, particularly in our operations. In future state, we expect a redefined AIG parent expense structure to be approximately 1% to 1.5% of premiums, which today is roughly $250 million to $350 million.\n\n AIG parent will have 5 primary roles and objectives - Unclear, likely Peter Zaffino (Chairman and CEO) (AIG):\npublic company matters, including finance, legal, compliance and regulatory oversight as well as corporate governance; communications with key stakeholders, including the investment community, rating agencies, regulators, policymakers and AIG colleagues; risk management, culture, performance and human capital management; and strategy, including business development, M&A and design and execution of key initia"

As we progress our future state business model, we anticipate achieving approximately $500 million in cost reductions at AIG parent and a cost to achieve of around $400 million with substantially quicker earn-in of savings that we achieved with AIG 200.  As expense savings begin to earn through, the reductions will largely be seen in other operations, which is where general operating expenses are currently accounted for.  With respect to Corebridge, I took you through our current thinking on separation and timing of the secondary offerings.  Lastly, on capital management. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries to support profitable growth. We remain on track to reduce AIG common stock outstanding to be between 600 million and 650 million shares and achieve a debt-to-capital leverage at the lower end of our 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation of Corebridge.  As I noted earlier, we increased our common stock dividend by 12.5%, starting in the second quarter of this year. And in addition to our stock repurchases in the first quarter, to date, we have repurchased $240 million of AIG common stock in the second quarter. Apart from the progress we're making on these components of our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, we also expect tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields. We are confident that our continued progress on strategic initiatives and our capital management strategy will allow us to achieve our ROCE targets and deliver long-term profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Sabra. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will cover 2 accounting changes, provide more details on first quarter results and give an overview of Commercial Mortgage Loans. First, the 1-month lag in financial reporting for the General Insurance International segment was eliminated last quarter. The lag elimination did not impact earnings significantly, but it did affect premiums written comparisons to 2022. Details on the premium impacts are in the financial supplement on Page 26.  Second, we adopted the change in accounting standard for certain long-duration products, commonly called LDTI. Yesterday, 8-Ks were filed that provide restated prior year financial results for AIG and Corebridge. The cumulative effect at year-end 2022 was an increase of $1.5 billion to adjusted equity and an increase of $1.0 billion to total shareholders' equity. This impact is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is a GAAP accounting change only and does not impact statutory results, insurance company cash flows or economic returns. Going forward, we expect a modest run rate increase in L&R APTI and less market and mortality-driven volatility from the change in accounting standards.  Turning to the quarter, as Peter mentioned, AIG's first quarter adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted share, up 9% from last year on a restated basis and up 25% from originally reported. Key trends in the quarter and similar to the last 3 quarters were higher GI underwriting results and higher income from fixed maturities and loans and lower alternative investment income. Compared to the prior year quarter, there was a higher impact from noncontrolling interest from the Corebridge IPO in 3Q '22.  Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.1 billion. Similar to the fourth quarter, income from fixed maturities and loans in both GI and L&R rose sequentially and over the prior year, while returns on alternative investments were down $593 million compared to very strong annualized returns of 28% last year.  Income on fixed maturities and loans rose by $573 million over the prior year, with average new money reinvestment rates of 5.35%, about 220 basis points above sales and maturities. The yield rose to 4.29%, up 78 basis points from 1Q '22 and 23 basis points over 4Q '22. Part of the increase in fixed maturity yields resulted from our proactive repositioning over the last 2 quarters in the U.S. GI portfolio. We sold and reinvested about $6 billion in fixed maturities, resulting in a realized loss of $224 million, but added 9 basis points of GI yield improvement for the quarter. We expect incremental yield pickup from this repositioning in 2Q '23 and also from higher reinvestment rates throughout 2023 based on the current rate and spread environment.  Turning to the segments. GI adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.2 billion, $37 million higher than 1Q '22, principally due to a $56 million increase in underwriting income from both higher-earned premiums and a 1 point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio, which was 91.9%. Peter covered underwriting results in detail, but I want to add that GI reserves had favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance at prior year premiums of $54 million.  Turning to L&R results for the first quarter. APTI was $886 million, down $48 million compared to $934 million in 1Q '22 as restated. Consistent with GI, L&R had a strong increase in base portfolio investment income, but lower alternative investment income. Mortality experience improved, but fee income was down due to lower capital market levels compared to a year ago. As Peter noted, L&R premiums and deposits were very strong at $10.4 billion. Notably, Individual Retirement sales were $4.9 billion, a 26% increase over the prior year quarter with record levels of fixed and fixed index annuity sales because of higher crediting rates.  Group Retirement deposits grew 19%, with higher out-of-plan fixed annuity sales and new plan acquisitions. Strong fixed and fixed index annuity sales, net of surrenders, resulted in $1.3 billion of positive flows to the General Account in Individual Retirement, up from $0.7 billion last year. While surrenders are up, they remain below projections. Variable annuity net flows, which impact the separate account, were negative.  To conclude on earnings for the quarter, other operations adjusted pretax loss, or APTL, was $491 million, a $70 million increase due to lower APTI from consolidated investment entities in Asset Management, which had strong private equity results in 1Q '22. Corporate GOE decreased $27 million from the prior year and $77 million from 4Q '22 despite $29 million of additional expense related to the corporate separation.  Turning to AIG's balance sheet. Book value per common share was $58.87 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end, principally due to higher valuations on available-for-sale securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Adjusted book value was $75.87 per share, roughly flat with year-end. At the end of March, we issued $750 million of senior notes, a portion of which was used to pay down an April bond maturity.  Our leverage ratio declined to 32.8%, down about 1 point from year-end even with the new issuance due to the change in AOCI in the quarter. Excluding AOCI and the Fortitude-embedded derivative, debt leverage was 26.3%.  For the first quarter of 2023, AIG's consolidated adjusted ROCE was 8.7%, comprised of 11.6% in GI and 10.7% in L&R. As Peter discussed, we are laser-focused on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation.  Peter provided a lot of detail on the quarter. So I'll use my remaining time to cover investments, particularly Commercial Mortgage Loans, given the recent focus on this asset class. First, I want to emphasize that our investment portfolio is grounded in the liability profile of our 2 insurance businesses. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration, cash flow and liquidity needs of the liabilities.

Over the last several years, we have improved the risk profile of the investment portfolio by reducing capital-intensive, less liquid or more volatile assets such as hedge funds. With the onset of COVID and, again, with rising interest rates last year, we further tightened investment guidelines and moved up in quality, including the GI repositioning mentioned earlier and also sales of L&R non-investment-grade assets.  Turning to our Commercial Mortgage Loan exposures. I'll start by noting that our mortgages are senior secured loans on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography with strong loan to values, or LTVs, averaging 59% and debt service coverage ratios averaging 1.9x. We are the lead lender on more than 80% of our loans, which gives us important control rights.  Excluding Fortitude funds withheld assets, we had $33.8 billion of Commercial Mortgage Loans at the end of March, of which $30.3 billion were at Corebridge and $3.5 billion at General Insurance. The largest property type is multifamily housing or apartments, about 40% of our Commercial Mortgage Loans. Industrial Property loans are about 16% of the portfolio. Both multifamily and industrial are performing well. We are, however, focused on traditional U.S. office, which is $5.4 billion or 2% of AIG's invested assets. Our U.S. office allocation has been shrinking for several years, particularly when we tightened underwriting standards further for office, retail and hotels with the onset of COVID. Currently, 94% of the office loans are high-quality rated CM1 or CM2 with debt service coverage averaging about 2.1x and weighted average LTVs of 64%. Valuations are updated annually by a third party, and we continue to monitor valuations given rising cap rates.  We also have a credit or CECL allowance against the portfolio of about $330 million or 3.7% against the office loan portfolio and $584 million for the total commercial mortgage portfolio or 1.7%, which is higher than many peers as we use CMBS default data in our methodology.  Roughly 3/4 of the building securing the loans are Class A or newer buildings with better amenities. The majority are in the top 5 U.S. metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts, including in New York City, which historically has been one of the strongest office markets in the country.  Today, we are intensely focused on office loan maturities in the next 2 years, about $2 billion or 28 loans. We are already in discussions with many borrowers about their plans and our requirements for refinancing or extension, including additional equity revised terms or other commitments. While valuations are under pressure, cash flows are the primary source of debt service for our loans, and we will continue to monitor the loans carefully. We look forward to updating you on our investment performance in the quarters ahead.  To wrap up, our first quarter 2023 results demonstrate continued sustained and strong financial results, rising investment portfolio yields, significant progress against strategic initiatives, robust capital and liquidity and continued progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter."

And you covered, I think, a ton of detail, which is helpful. But the net-to-gross ratio didn't change. And I would have thought that based on the current dynamics in the property cat market and much improved performance on a lot of casualty lines that have been heavily reinsured, that we would see AIG retaining more of its gross premium. I was hoping you could talk through that. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nMeyer, this is Quentin. I think we're having a little audio technical difficulties. So if you can bear with us for just one moment, we'll be back in just 1 second.  [Technical Difficulty] \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nCan you hear me now? \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nYes. You're coming through loud and clear, Peter. Meyer, do you want to just repeat your question? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nI heard the questions, Quentin. Sorry, I actually had a good answer too. I just was on -- not a microphone that worked. So Meyer, back to your question is that we had -- you have to look at the portfolio composition to be able to answer the question. And Validus Re obviously had meaningful growth on gross and net during the quarter. And so, therefore, it's hard to look at the cessions year-over-year when you're having a retro program that fits the portfolio that you're underwriting.  We've never had a strategy that we're going to time the market with our reinsurance partners. They've always been strategic. They've always been supportive. They've always deployed the capital in support of AIG. And so we were not going to do anything, other than to try to get the appropriate terms and conditions with them and have not really changed much of our risk appetite in terms of taking that. And I think that has generated a terrific result for us on net premium written, but also on the combined ratios.  So I think I wouldn't look into just one quarter in terms of discussions. And as I said, we have a lot in terms of the guidance I've given on PCG, which we will still assume a lot of risk. And I guess -- let's just play it out for the full year. We're not looking to do anything materially different. \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Perfect. That's helpful. And I don't know if this is even a good question. But does the changing approach to North American Personal Lines have any implications for the International Personal segment? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nIt really doesn't, Meyer. I mean they're really distinct businesses. I mean, certainly, our Travel and Warranty have platforms that are global and that give us capabilities across the world. But as you know, Private Client Group, in particular in the U.S., is a unique asset. Again, the guidance I gave in the prepared remarks, it's one that we believe we will grow the net premium written because we don't believe we need the quota shares anymore after the excellent job the team has done in repositioning and re-underwriting that portfolio. We have substantially less cat in aggregates that we once did. So I think that's something that will be a little different in terms of -- if you look at International.  While International, we have a terrific Personal Insurance business. Some of it was affected by COVID. It's growing back, between Japan's Personal Insurance, our Global Accident & Health, which is predominantly International as well as our Travel and Warranty, which are rebounding in terms of growth. So I don't think that there's a lot of correlation between International and North America. But both we believe in and we're investing in, and you'll continue to see improvement. It will just be at a different pace because of the anomaly of the high net worth business."

My understanding, and tell me if I'm wrong, is that much of the change to the MGA is scale related. And does that mean that we should expect the expense ratio to fall over time as the MGA gain speed? And maybe just correct me if I'm wrong, does that shift around how we think about sort of the relationship between expenses and losses in that business over time, not necessarily next quarter, but over time? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nPaul, let me make sure I understand the question. I mean are you asking in terms of what's going to happen to the expense ratios over time as we start to reposition and grow the business? \n\nJon Paul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nYes, I am. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nOkay, thank you. This year, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to see a lot more net premium written. The reason for that is as we were repositioning the business over the last 2 years, we bought very low excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance. We bought a substantial quota share. We ceded a significant amount of Syndicate 2019, which also had retrocession behind that in a variety of forms. And so the net premium written was not that large as you've seen. And so part of the repositioning with Stone Point and having an MGA, one is that we think there's tremendous growth opportunities that exist in the business with other capital providers and believe that how we have repositioned the business through rate increases and disciplined underwriting on the admitted side, and then also the non-admitted became an option for us to have flexibility in form and rate. And so that was very positive for us in terms of repositioning the business.  As we look to 2023 and beyond, we believe that the business is going to perform much better, much more profitable. And we don't need to cede off as much on the quota share. So as a result, in this particular calendar year, what you'll see is a lot of net premium written growth, improved loss ratios and both the expense ratio on an acquisition basis as well as the general operating expenses will improve. And so the overall combined ratio will improve dramatically. We're not going to be where we want to be in 2023, but believe by the time we hit 2024, those results will continue to improve. \n\nJon Paul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nThat's great. And maybe a big picture talking about a little bit more of the big picture cat exposures. I mean it looks like -- I'm just looking at the General Insurance overall, the cat load has pretty much stabilized, but that's been a huge part of the improvement over time. Do you think we're pretty much done? And again, I'm not talking about next quarter. I'm talking about years to come, from making this portfolio of businesses have the cat load that you want. I mean is this sort of the run rate we should be thinking about in the long term? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThe team has done an incredible job of underwriting the Property line of business across all of AIG over multiple years. Our ability to reposition that portfolio, we talk a lot about aggregates, we talk a lot about reductions and we talked a lot about where we want to grow. I think we were in a terrific place as we enter 2023 from that hard work. And when I look at where we decided to grow, we constantly talk about where the best risk-adjusted returns available in the marketplace, where is our capacity most valued and where we value for clients.  So when I look at where we've grown, Validus Re certainly was a big part of that. Lexington has been hitting it out of the park on just about every aspect, whether it's top line growth, retention, new business, rate, like how they actually are more relevant in the marketplace. Working with Dave McElroy and the team, we've taken back some of the Retail Property. But then in other parts of the world, we've taken it back up. So like we've repositioned the portfolio and then have coupled that with the reinsurance to reflect the portfolio it is today.  So if I summarize what happened at 1/1 is that we saw terrific opportunities for Validus Re to grow. So we took the PMLs up there a little bit. We dramatically took the PMLs down in the Private Client Group substantially. Again, I gave the return period, that every return period from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 was substantially reduced on all peril and, in particular, on wildfire. And we actually took the commercial book. Despite our growth in Lexington and Global Specialty, we took those PMLs down as well. So overall, when you look at the increased PMLs in the first quarter of Validus Re and the reductions that we had in the Commercial business and the Personal business, our overall PMLs are down year-over-year.  I think that's a tremendous outcome when you look at where we're growing, how we're driving risk-adjusted returns, how we couple that with reinsurance and our overall net PMLs are down at all the critical return periods. So I think all of that's been purposeful. The team has done an unbelievable job executing."

So just wondering from here, should we expect that you'll sort of hold a bit more capital against uncertainty? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThank you. We were very disciplined in terms of the $750 million debt raise. Again, I'm going to let Sabra comment a little bit more on liquidity and capital. But when I look at all the different components of our capital strategy, I think we executed incredibly well in the first quarter. I mean our primary focus is to make sure that we have the appropriate capital levels in the insurance company subsidiaries for growth, and so it gave us tremendous opportunities at 1/1 as it will give us for the entire year.  Very focused on our leverage ratios and being at the lower end just to give us financial flexibility. And of course, I've been leading everybody every quarter saying, we're looking at the dividend and to have a 12.5% dividend increase not only helps complete some of the capital management strategy we've been talking about, but also shows the confidence that we have on our earnings and how we're managing liquidity. But I'll have Sabra comment a little bit on the parent liquidity and our approach to capital. And it is proven to be conservative at this time. Sabra? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. Yes. And I would just comment that, first of all, we look at our capitalization, both in base and stress scenarios. I mean this is just what I would call basic risk management procedures that we do. And we're very comfortable with our balance sheet even in the current environment where, obviously, there's a lot of stress on the system with the debt ceiling and the rest.  From where we sit today, we have very strong robust capital and liquidity. And as Peter noted, the Board was comfortable raising the dividend for the first time in many, many years because of the significant turnaround of GI underwriting results over the past 5 years. So as we sit here today, yes, we'll continue to evaluate our financial flexibility for additional share repurchases, keeping in mind that our first goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can withstand turbulent times. \n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nVery helpful. I guess maybe on the Crop deal, I guess, I was just wondering are there -- if you could maybe point to any other sort of targeted units where you could do sort of similar value unlocking deals there as you sort of work towards margin improvement and simplification. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nGreat. Thank you. We're always looking at the portfolio and looking at areas where we can add, where we can improve the overall structure of AIG and looking at the different parts of the world that we compete in. I think Crop is a little bit anomalous just because we really do believe it's a very good business, but you know how it works, which is driven by commodity prices and yields. And I think that having scale is really important. While the top line that we publish on a gross and net basis is significant, that's gone up 40%, 50%, if not more, over the past several years based on those components.  And we believe that Crop Risk Services, in order for it to achieve its ultimate potential that being part of a bigger enterprise and one that valued it like Great American, was the prudent approach for us at this time. And so that was something that was specific to that business. It was specific to how we look to strategically position AIG for the future and also making certain that with Crop Risk Services, it had a great opportunity to scale and realize this potential. So I feel like we really found a very good partner and that's really what drove the outcome for CRS."

I know you mentioned the base case is still secondaries, but I think you also mentioned that you were considering some alternatives. So I just wanted to see if you could extrapolate on that a bit at all. What kind of alternatives could you look towards? And how could some of those things potentially improve things for shareholders? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Alex. I'll try to expand a bit on it. Because as you can imagine, there's not a lot of more detail that I can really share beyond my prepared remarks. We do believe the secondary is the preferred path. But obviously, it's subject to market conditions as we saw in the first quarter, but we're prepared to go in the second quarter.  Our objective has not changed, which is for AIG to reduce its ownership stake in Corebridge over time. And so I think it's prudent, looking at a variety of different options to make sure that we're driving value for shareholders and provide a path that will recognize the value of Corebridge. Corebridge has done a terrific job since we've announced that we were going to commence upon doing an IPO, getting themselves positioned to be an independent public company and the stock was trading at a deep discount in the first quarter.  I mean one of the alternatives, I don't think we're going to go much beyond this, was what we announced on Laya Healthcare. And so making sure we're sticking to the core business of Corebridge. And we'll just give you updates as the weeks and over the next month progresses. But we're prepared and are very excited about hopefully getting the secondary done in the second quarter. \n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. Follow-up I had is on corporate expenses. I think it was the first time you guys gave a bit more explicit guidance around where corporate expenses for RemainCo could shake out at that 1% to 1.5% premiums. And I just wanted to make sure I understood some of the mechanics. I mean when I think about that level, I mean, is that what I should expect in sort of Corporate GOE, overall Corporate costs? I mean how do I think about that? And then just a technical kind of question. The investment that I think you mentioned leading up to that, will that go through operating and also be reflected in Corporate? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. So we try to provide as much detail as we could on the expense savings. Certainly, let me start with AIG 200 because we still have more to earn through on AIG 200 savings in 2023 and 2024. So over 50% of that will be earned in mostly through the second and through fourth quarter of 2023. We have begun to separate Corebridge. And -- but upon deconsolidation, approximately $300 million of the AIG Corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement. So that's another variable that you need to consider.  We also gave guidance as we're working through our future state business model, $250 million to $350 million of parent expenses. And then the remaining will be worked through to fit the business model in terms of what we're designing for the future of AIG. We want to make sure that we have a lean model that's not synonymous with expense cutting, but it is how we're going to be in each market, how we face off with our clients and our distribution partners to maximize growth and all the opportunities that present them themselves to AIG and making sure that we have a structure that supports that.  Sequencing is important. We've been working on a variety of different initiatives that are substantial, and we're performing out all of them, making certain that General Insurance has the capital and support it needs to grow in this market; repositioning some of our businesses, which we covered in my prepared remarks; making sure we complete AIG 200, the operational separation; preparing to do the secondary; advancing Corebridge capital structure; and then making sure that we're working to get this future state business model implemented, but it has to be in that order. And we've given you the guidance. We've done the work. We know that's the savings that we'll achieve.  Some of that's going to go into the business. And so the business has to get rationalized and leaner in order to be able to absorb more expenses. But our commitment is the $500 million in addition to the guidance that we've given in the other components. And we're highly confident we'll execute on that at the right time, meaning we've got to get these other things further along. And then when we have clear line of sight in terms of separation, we'll be able to execute on the target operating model."

I'm trying to just dumb it down a little bit here. If we look at what the growth is X, let's call it, Validus Re crop, what would have looked like? And what was the tailwind from Validus Re crop just from the Commercial Lines growth on a year-over-year basis? And the reason I'm asking is, those are obviously very big first quarter premium numbers. So I just want to make sure I'm not extrapolating that for the remainder of the year. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Brian. Certainly, Validus contributed a meaningful amount to the growth. But look, we bought a lot of retro. It's the first quarter. It's not all property. So each quarter is a bit different in terms of not being able to straight line it.  Crop Risk Services had low single-digit growth. So that was not a contributor at all in terms of net premium written. We had very strong, as I said, growth in our Specialty business, in Lexington, in our Property, offset a little bit by Financial Lines. But I put the guidance in there because I feel very confident that we're going to have strong growth throughout the year. Even though the quarters are a little bit different, businesses like Europe is heavy 1/1. And we start to have sort of different mix of business over the second, third and fourth. But I feel seeing the pipeline, looking at how you grow, I mean, the first thing I would look at is what's the client retention and how is the new business, what's happening with rate and are we growing in the businesses that we want to. And I think we are checking all the boxes here and see that those businesses have more opportunity in the future, not less. And so I think the growth that you saw in the first quarter, obviously, there's a mix of business, but I would expect to see similar growth throughout the rest of the year. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nOkay. Very helpful. And then second question, just curious, some other companies are talking about how the Commercial Property markets are even further firming up in the second quarter. There's more business available. Are you seeing the same kind of dynamics or things actually continuing to improve here in the Commercial Property markets? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we are seeing that. I mean, again, it's early in the second quarter, but views on April. And as we look to the rest of the second quarter, we're seeing Property continue to firm up and getting stronger than it was in the first quarter. So that's something that we're trying to be focused on clients, making sure we're driving value and we have a lot of capital to deploy. So we expect to be trading actively in the second quarter.  Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Sorry for the 1-minute hiccup on the microphone, but greatly appreciate you dialing in, and I wish everybody a great day. Thank you."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause these actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.   Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.   Finally, note today's remarks as they related to net premiums written in General Insurance are presented on a constant dollar basis and where applicable, are also adjusted for the lag elimination in International that is described in our earnings release and related documents. Additionally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial.   AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, August 4.   With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.   I am very pleased to report that AIG delivered another exceptional quarter with strong financial performance. In addition, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that are strengthening AIG for the future. We again demonstrated our ability to deliver high-quality outcomes while executing on multiple complex initiatives during very difficult market conditions.   I would like to start with financial highlights from the second quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion or $1.75 per diluted common share, representing a 26% increase year-over-year and the best quarterly adjusted EPS result for AIG since 2007.   Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 11%, led by our Commercial business, which grew 13%. Underwriting income in the quarter was approximately $600 million. The adjusted accident year combined ratio ex cats was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year and the best result for AIG since 2007. Our cat loss ratio was 3.9% or $250 million of catastrophe losses, a terrific result against the backdrop of a very challenging cat quarter for the industry.   The Life and Retirement business reported very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million, up 33% year-over-year. And premiums and deposits were over $10 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales of Fixed Index Annuity products.   Consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion in the second quarter, a 31% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $725 million, a 58% increase.   AIG returned $822 million to shareholders in the second quarter through $554 million of common stock repurchases and a $268 million of dividends, which reflects a 12.5% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend that we announced on our last call. As you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors approved an increase to our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion, which reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, consistent with the capital management strategy we have previously outlined.   Lastly, our balance sheet remains very strong. And we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in parent liquidity. During the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will provide more information on the following 5 topics. First, the significant strategic actions we took in the second quarter to reposition AIG. During that review, I will provide additional details on the divestitures of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, the launch of Private Client Select as an MGA serving the high and ultra-high net worth markets and the actions we took with respect to Corebridge.   Second, I will discuss financial results for General Insurance. Third, I will give an overview of the results for Life and Retirement. Fourth, I will provide an update on capital management. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge.   Turning to the strategic actions we executed on. I will start with Validus Re. In May, we announced the divestiture of Validus Re and AlphaCat to RenaissanceRe for approximately $2.75 billion in cash and $250 million in RenRe common stock. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval.   We're very pleased to have RenRe as the acquirer. RenRe is a very important partner to us, a company with a terrific reputation. And we value the strong relationship we have with Kevin and his management team. We believe RenRe will be an excellent owner of Validus Re.   Now let me provide some highlights on our rationale for the divestiture. We acquired Validus in 2018, which at the time provided AIG with business diversification not limited just to reinsurance but also attractive specialty businesses, including Talbot and Western World, which were not part of the sale to RenRe and will remain with AIG.   Since 2018, we transformed Validus Re by reunderwriting the portfolio, leading to significant premium growth and improved profitability. In addition, we dramatically changed the business mix of the portfolio to achieve a more attractive balance among property, casualty and specialty businesses, improved geographic diversity and decreased peak zone exposures.   For AIG, this divestiture represents a key milestone on our journey as it further streamlines our business model, simplifies the structure of our global portfolio, substantially reduces volatility, which I will explain in a moment, generate additional liquidity and capital efficiencies and accelerates our capital management strategy. Due to the nature of assumed reinsurance and the portfolio mix of Validus Re, this business is capital-intensive and disproportionately contributes to AIG's overall volatility and PMLs. \n\n As we have discussed over the past few years, the core objectives of the property and casualty turnaround were:\nto substantially improve the overall quality of AIG's global portfolio and underwriting results; reduce volatility through a massive reduction in growth limits written; better manage peak zone exposures and geographic balance; and strategically use reinsurance across our overall business. A turnaround of this magnitude is made harder when you have a treaty reinsurance business, which, by its very nature, has volatility.   We have completed a rigorous enterprise-wide modeling exercise using RMS version 21 to approximate the PMLs for AIG post closing, and all categories will significantly reduce. This analysis took into account AIG's exposure, Validus Re's exposure as of February 1, 2023, and combined output for both companies on a"

      "raw_bytes": "IG post closing, and all categories will significantly reduce. This analysis took into account AIG's exposure, Validus Re's exposure as of February 1, 2023, and combined output for both companies on an occurrence and aggregate basis.   Let me provide a few examples of the model output for AIG post closing of the Validus Re sale on an occurrence basis. For worldwide, all perils, net PMLs were reduced by 45% at the 1-in-250 return period. Worldwide hurricane PMLs will reduce by 60% at the 1-in-250 return period and by 70% at the 1-in-100 return period.   North America hurricane PMLs will reduce by 70% at the 1-100 return period. North America earthquake PMLs will reduce by 55% at the 1-250 return period. Japan typhoon PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-100 return period. Japan earthquake PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-250 return period. And for EMEA, all PMLs will decrease by 85% at the 1-250 return period and 75% at the 1-100 return period.   In addition to the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, there were several additional components that made the sale of Validus Re appealing for AIG. The required tangible equity that AIG will deliver to RenRe upon closing, which is $2.1 billion, is substantially below what Validus Re would have required if the business remained at AIG.   We will receive $900 million above the book value of Validus Re, which reflects the improved quality of the portfolio since AIG's purchase of the business in 2018. We also expect to receive, through a pre-closing dividend, excess capital in the legal entities being transferred to RenRe, which we estimate will be approximately $200 million.   In addition, a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG will be settled through internal dividends, and we expect AIG to benefit from a $400 million reduction in risk-based capital requirements following the closing. As part of the transaction, AIG will retain 95% of future reserve changes in the portfolio delivered at closing. We will receive the benefit of future reserve releases as the portfolio matures, and we will likely purchase an adverse development cover prior to the closing to minimize potential future reserve exposure.   In the second quarter, we also announced and closed the sale of Crop Risk Services to American Financial Group for $240 million in cash. Crop Risk Services was part of the Validus acquisition in 2018. Over the remainder of the 2023 crop season, AIG will continue to benefit from earned premium for crop business booked since the start of the year. But as we enter 2024, this business will no longer have an impact on AIG's financial results.   Next, I want to provide more detail on the formation of Private Client Select as an MGA, which is now referred to as PCS. The MGA has officially launched, and we expect to add new capital providers in the coming quarters. We believe the MGA structure is ideal for PCS as it creates flexibility and alternatives for clients, agents and brokers in an environment that's becoming more complex.   The high and ultra-high net worth markets PCS is focused on have significant foundational challenges include loss cost pressure, inflation, increased cat exposure through increased total insured values and more concentration in peak zones, and primary and secondary peril modeling has been [indiscernible]. AIG will continue to support the MGA. And because we will be assuming risk on our balance sheet, we've established the MGA's risk framework, which is designed to improve its financial performance in 2023 and as we enter 2024.   Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made with Stone Point Capital on this MGA structure. And we're well positioned to accelerate the business plan through the remainder of the year.   Moving to Corebridge. In June, we completed a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock with gross proceeds to AIG of $1.2 billion. The offering was well received by the market. And the new owners included a strong mix of long-term holders, which we believe results in a more stable and well-diversified shareholder base for Corebridge.   Also in June, Corebridge announced and paid a $400 million special dividend in addition to its $150 million ordinary quarterly dividend and completed the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from AIG and Blackstone. AIG's net proceeds from these actions were approximately $540 million.   At the end of the second quarter, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 65%. These actions demonstrate our commitment to deconsolidation and eventually full separation. As we noted on our last call, we continue to explore all options with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.   Turning to other strategic actions we are taking in Corebridge. The previously announced sale process for Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland that is part of Corebridge, is proceeding very well. We expect to announce a positive outcome from this process in the near term and expect that the proceeds from this divestiture will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders.   Additionally, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of the U.K. Life business that is part of Corebridge. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow its management team to focus on core Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States.   Turning to General Insurance. We had another quarter of strong growth in both gross and net premiums written. Gross premiums written were $10.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Global Commercial, which represents 80% of gross premiums written, grew 15%. And Global Personal decreased 1%. \n\n Net premiums written were $7.5 billion, an increase of 11%. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which grew 13% while Global Personal grew 5%. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 18% in net premiums written. Excluding Validus Re, net premiums written growth in North America Commercial was 13%. The major drivers were as follows:\nRetail Property, which grew over 50%; Validus Re, which grew 32%; and Lexington, which grew 18%, led by wholesale property and casualty.   I would like to provide a few additional details about Lexington's growth, given it continues to be an important part of AIG's strategy. Property grew 38% year-over-year driven by very strong retention in new business as well as strong rate increases. Submission activity was up over 30% year-over-year. Casualty grew 41%, supported by strong retention in new business, and its submission count was up over 90%.   In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6% primarily driven by property, which was up 34%; Talbot, which was up 17%; and Global Specialty, which was up mid-single digits, which reflected the impact of additional reinsurance purchasing in the second quarter.   Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio. International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 200 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.   And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, produced new business of approximately $600 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year.   This growth was driven by Lexington property, which saw excellent new business growth of over 40%. Retail Property had over 50% new business growth, offset by Financial Lines, where new business contracted by over 35%.   International Commercial new business was $485 million, which grew 5%. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased over 100% year-over-year and property, which grew new business by 40%, offset by Financia"

This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased over 100% year-over-year and property, which grew new business by 40%, offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by over 20%.   As I noted on our last call, we continue to see headwinds in certain aspects of Financial Lines due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing. Despite these continuing dynamics, we remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions and price while taking a long-term view on this line of business by not following the market down.   Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rate increased 8% in the second quarter or 9% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 23% with wholesale property up over 35% and Retail Property, which was up 30%.   In International Commercial, rate increased 9%, and the exposure increase was 1%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 21%; Talbot, which was up 14%; and Global Specialty, which was up 11% driven by global energy, which was up 21%. Rate plus exposure was 10% in North America, 11% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International, which in each case remains above loss cost trend.   Turning to Personal Insurance. Note that second quarter results in North America Personal reflected the fact that PCG was transitioning to become Private Client Select. North America Personal net premiums written increased 17% primarily driven by lower quota share sessions in PCG, offset by decreases in travel and warranty. Overall, we had strong growth in net premiums written of 17% with PCG net premiums written growing over 60%.   With PCS now officially launched as an MGA, there are several components of AIG's business in the high and ultra-high net worth markets that will result in improved financial performance for AIG over the balance of 2023. First, as we outlined in prior calls, over the last few years, we evolved the model for our high and ultra-high net worth business such that we expect net premiums written to grow significantly over the remainder of the year with our current expectations showing net premiums written increasing over 75% in the third and fourth quarters.   Second, the lag and earned premium growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2023 dissipated. And we saw a 36% growth in earned premium in the second quarter. And we expect that earned premium growth will continue to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. The additional earned premium will provide operating leverage, which will reduce our GOE ratio in the third and fourth quarter.   Third, AIG has [indiscernible] costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA. And we expect to eliminate these costs over the next 18 months.   Fourth, we expect the accident year loss ratio for our high and ultra-high net worth business will improve with the combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted market, which already had a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy year loss ratios in prior quarters. This should earn in for our high and ultra-high net worth business through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.   In International Personal, net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year. The modest growth was driven by travel and personal property in Japan. Overall, our key focus continues to be growing Accident & Health and our business in Japan.   Shifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 84.4%, a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year.   The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 85.1%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 83.1%, which continues to be an outstanding level of profitability. Global Personal reported a second quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CATs of 98.1%, a 170 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium.   Now I'd like to provide some context around midyear reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market before moving to Life and Retirement. We purchased our major reinsurance treaties at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter as we have a number of core midyear renewals, predominantly in specialty classes, and they were all successfully placed.   In addition, we decided to purchase additional retrocessional protection for Validus Re and a low excess of loss reinsurance placement for Private Client Group ahead of the wind season. Overall, the market exhibited more orderly behavior during midyear renewals amidst more stable trading conditions compared to January 1. Reinsure appetite for more discrete purchases increased somewhat, enabling a number of buyers to make up for shortfalls in coverage experienced at January 1.   Overall, midyear property cat pricing increased 25% to 35% year-over-year in the U.S. driven by Florida. This was the second year in a row of substantial rate increases. International renewals, driven by Australia and New Zealand, saw price increase 20% to 50% with higher increases resulting from loss activity in the region.   In previous calls, I touched on the increase in catastrophe losses from secondary perils. Through the first half of 2023, the industry has already experienced over $50 billion of insured losses, the majority of which were due to secondary perils, making 2023 already the fourth highest year on an inflation-adjusted basis.   A majority of insured losses continue to occur in the United States, highlighting the difficulty of managing volatility in the largest insurance market in the world. Against this challenging backdrop and a strengthened reinsurance rating environment, we maintained our conservative risk appetite and continue to have one of the lowest peak peril net positions in the market while managing our overall reinsurance spend.   Additionally, through each of our renewals, we maintain all of our principal relationships with our key reinsurance partners. While we are exiting the assumed reinsurance business through the sale of Validus Re, our ownership of RenRe common stock that we will receive as part of the purchase price consideration, coupled with our ability to invest up to $500 million in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, will allow us to continue to participate and benefit from partnering with a world-class reinsurer with less risk and capital requirements.   Turning to Life Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business produced very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million. And adjusted return on segment equity was 12.2%, representing a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year.   Premiums and deposits grew 42% year-over-year to $10 billion driven by record Fixed Index Annuity sales. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.6 billion and a financial leverage ratio of 28%. Over the second quarter, we continue to make good progress against the Corebridge operational separation so that it can eventually be a fully standalone company.   A key focus has been executing against IT separation, which we believe will be substantially complete by the end of this year. To date, approximately 55% of the transition service agreements put in place at the time of the IPO have already been exited.   Now turning to capital management. As I noted earlier, in the second quarter, we returned approximately $822 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. And the additional $400 millio"

And the additional $400 million of common stock we repurchased in July brings a total amount of capital we've returned to shareholders since the beginning of the second quarter to over $1.2 billion.   In addition, we continue to focus on maintaining well-capitalized subsidiaries to enable profitable growth across our global portfolio. And we remain committed to having a leverage ratio in the low 20s and a share count between 600 million to 650 million post deconsolidation of Corebridge.   The additional liquidity we will have following the closing of the sale of Validus Re will largely be used for share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate beginning in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2024. We also plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale of Validus Re to reduce outstanding debt.   Lastly with respect to ROCE. We remain highly committed to delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the second quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these are sustain and improve underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG with lower expenses across the organization; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. The sequencing of each component has been very important.   We are now able to accelerate this work with the GI underwriting turnaround, AIG 200 and the investment group restructuring largely behind us and the operational separation of Corebridge further along, in addition to divestitures, which I've already outlined. As I stated on our last call, we're moving away from AIG's historical conglomerate structure to being a leading global insurance company with a leaner and better defined parent company.   We continue to expect approximately $500 million in cost reductions across AIG with a cost to achieve of approximately $400 million with substantially faster earn-in of savings than we saw with AIG 200. Sabra will provide more details on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE in her remarks.   Overall, I could not be more pleased with our progress and what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. Our strong momentum continues, and we have a very solid foundation to build on for the future.   Now I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on second quarter results, including net investment income and underwriting performance, provide a balance sheet update and review the drivers of our path to a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE.   Starting with second quarter results. As Peter noted, adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year or an annualized adjusted ROCE of 9.4%. Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share was $1.75, up 26% from last year, reflecting the impact of share repurchases on EPS."

      "raw_bytes": "strong underwriting margins and higher net investment income in General Insurance; increased base investment yields; and spreads and strong sales in Life and Retirement and continued expense reduction in balanced capital management and Corporate and Other.   Turning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, investment income improved significantly, up 31% from last year and up 7% sequentially on a consolidated basis and also rose in each segment. Reinvestment rates are driving higher yields. The average new money yield was 5.46%, about 210 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities.   In General Insurance, this increased the yield on the fixed maturities and loan portfolios 93 basis points over last year and 23 basis points sequentially. In Life and Retirement, the yield improved 75 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively.   Alternative investment returns also improved this quarter, although they remain below our long-term outlook totaling $147 million for an annualized return of 6.0%. Credit performance has been strong with more upgrades than downgrades in the fixed maturity portfolios and continued derisking of lower-rated assets.   Commercial property valuations continue to face downward pressure from higher cap rates, which impacts loan to values on commercial mortgage loans and investment returns on real estate equity funds. However, debt service coverage ratios are holding up well and are generally strong across the portfolio, including office.   Turning to General Insurance. APTI was $1.3 billion, up $62 million from the prior year. Net investment income rose by $267 million. And underwriting income for the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, were $73 million.   Total catastrophe losses were $250 million, up $129 million and included $56 million of first quarter CAT mostly from U.S. events, including a tornado that occurred at quarter end. This was a very solid result, as Peter noted, given the high level of industry catastrophe losses, particularly in North America.   North America cat losses were $159 million, while International totaled $91 million, largely from Typhoon Mawar. During the second quarter, we conducted North America casualty DVRs, or detailed valuation reviews, which reviewed about 20% of reserves compared to 15% last year.   In our DVRs, we focus on changes in frequency and severity trends, including social and other types of inflation as well as changes in claims trends and settlements such as occurred during COVID. As we noted previously, casualty bodily injury and medical workers' comp trends in our book have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions.   Our approach in these situations is to react quickly to adverse development, but to be conservative and wait to recognize favorable trends until accident years are more mature. We maintain the same approach for the COVID accident years where claims development patterns in many casualty lines slowed.   For those years, we have lagged our development factors to allow more time for claims patterns to mature as we are taking the conservative position that industry claims experience will revert to pre-COVID patterns. In addition to the results of the DVRs, prior year development also includes amortization of the ADC gain, changes in prior year catastrophe losses and impacts from loss-sensitive lines that are not related to DVRs.   In this quarter, prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums was $25 million favorable. This was made up of $115 million of favorable loss reserve development, partially offset by $90 million of prior year return premium. The lower favorable development compared to last year is mainly attributable to the excess workers' compensation DVR, which was favorable by about $75 million in second quarter last year but is being completed in the third quarter of this year.   Our favorable loss reserve development included $167 million from North American Commercial Lines, including $41 million of ADC amortization, $50 million of favorable development from our Agrium loss-sensitive portfolio and $74 million of favorable development resulting from North America DVRs. This was partially offset by $62 million of unfavorable development in International Commercial Lines, principally from a multiyear legacy casualty policy that was written with much higher limits than we do today.   In the third quarter, DVRs will cover nearly 70% of reserves, including Financial Lines. Financial Lines claims have not returned to the levels we experienced pre-COVID, which we believe reflects improved underwriting, better loss selection, continued ventilation of risk, our reinsurance strategy and achieving appropriate levels of rate.   With respect to underwriting. AIG's share of U.S. public company D&O securities class actions where we are the primary insurer is down from 42% in 2017 to about 20% at the end of the second quarter of this year.   With respect to rate. Since 2018, the compounded increases in the Financial Lines portfolio for corporate and national accounts are greater than 60% and 50%, respectively. However, consistent with our conservative approach, in addition to the lag development factors, we are placing more weight on longer-term experience and balancing out more favorable recent trends.   Turning to Life and Retirement. As Peter noted, second quarter results were strong with APTI up 30% over 2Q '22, driven by higher spread in underwriting margins and strong sales in Fixed Index Annuities. Both spreads and underwriting margins remain attractive, and fee margins improved with more favorable capital market levels compared to last year.   Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with 64 basis points improvement year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially driven by reinvestment rates. Individual Retirement APTI increased $215 million or 58% from 2Q '22 driven by base spread expansion and growth in general account products. Positive net flows to the general account were about $400 million.   Group Retirement APTI grew by $21 million or 12% driven by continued base spread expansion despite negative flows in the general account. Life Insurance APTI decreased $42 million, or 35%, primarily due to lower other yield enhancement income, partially offset by improved base portfolio returns and marginally favorable mortality experience. Institutional markets delivered very strong results with APTI up $50 million or 65% driven by investment income and reserve growth. Second quarter premiums and deposits reached $2.9 billion with $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer activity and $970 million of GIC transactions.   Turning to AIG's Other Operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $41 million over last year driven by an $80 million improvement in corporate and other due to the 4Q '22 sale of legacy investment portfolios that had losses of $119 million in 2Q '22. Corporate general operating expenses of $242 million included $67 million of Corebridge expenses, including separation expenses. Excluding Corebridge and separation-related expenses, corporate GOE decreased $19 million from the prior year.   Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy with share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and repayment of maturing debt. We ended the quarter with AIG parent liquidity of $4.3 billion.   We remain committed to maintaining strong capitalization in our insurance subsidiaries to support risk and growth. The General Insurance U.S. pool risk-based capital ratio is estimated in the 470% to the 480% range, and Life and Retirement is projected to be above its 400% target.   We repaid a $388 million debt maturity in the second quarter and continue to target debt leverage in the low 20s post deconsolidation of Corebridge.

At June 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 26.0%, including about $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. Book value per common share was $58.49 on June 30, 2023, up 6% from year-end. Adjusted book value per common share was $75.76 per share, flat from year-end.   Turning to ROCE. We remain intently focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.1% on a consolidated basis and 11.8% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement.   Capital management and rightsizing our equity base for AIG post deconsolidation are material levers for achieving our adjusted ROCE goal. In the near term, we will accelerate share repurchases in the fourth quarter and into 2024 with the additional liquidity from Validus proceeds, in addition to ordinary course liquidity generated by our business operations through subsidiary dividends and ongoing profitability.   We will balance these share repurchases with additional debt reduction consistent with our leverage target. We are committed to achieving a share count between 600 million and 650 million shares post deconsolidation, which we will be able to achieve with the increase in our share repurchase program to $7.5 billion.   Based on the size, risk profile and profitability of our General Insurance business and holding company needs today, we estimate a pro forma GAAP equity base, excluding AOCI, of approximately $40 billion for AIG ex-Corebridge. This is inclusive of about $4 billion in deferred tax asset NOLs that we exclude for adjusted common shareholders' equity calculation.   Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure, reduce volatility and drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.   With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Sabra.

I was hoping we could focus in on the general -- the North American Commercial business a little bit. I'm getting some questions about the growth. If you sort of assume a certain amount of growth is related to the price increases sort of ex-Validus and whether or not we saw a fair amount of growth -- just sort of if you normalize [indiscernible] Validus. Sorry, I know you gave a lot of detail there, but maybe if you could kind of simplify it for -- that'd be fantastic. \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSure. Thanks, Paul. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we are very pleased with our overall growth across the world. And retention is up, new business was terrific and balanced. And rate, well above loss cost, was evident in so many parts of our business.   If I unpack it as you asked, I mean, look at North America, we discussed Validus Re, was up 32%, but it's not cyclically its largest quarter. It was basically 25% of North America. But other businesses had tremendous quarters.   Lexington had 18% growth. But that was also part of us discontinuing a big program that we didn't like the risk-adjusted returns that had an impact on top line premium growth. And so I would look at Lexington in terms of casualty, which was 40% growth. Lexington property, which was 35% growth. Retail property was up over 50% in the quarter, and I outlined the rate increases were north of 30% for 2 quarters in a row.   Our actual retail casualty business was up in the high single digits. So it was a very good outcome for net premium written in North America. The headwind was Financial Lines, which was down a little bit over 10%, but that is something that is specific to North America. But we have a really good balance in growth.   If I look at -- I'll just expand a little bit in terms of International. We had really strong growth in property. Our syndicate Talbot was up 17%. International Specialty, I drew it out as a mid-single-digit growth net premium written in the quarter. We had some discretionary spends on treaty reinsurance. On a gross basis, it grew over 40%. And I want to call out, Financial Lines is not experiencing the same headwinds as North America, and International was flat. And that's our largest business in the second quarter in International. So had a little bit more of the weight in terms of the overall growth. But I thought it was really balanced, really well done and all the fundamentals we're executing on. \n\nJon Paul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nAnd my second question, I wanted to ask about the cat load in particular in North America as we think of it going forward. I mean, clearly, from the data you showed us, you talked about on the call the volatility piece or the tail is going to be reduced a lot on Validus Re. On an ongoing basis, do you also see kind of a reduction in the cat load from the efforts that you're making with Validus Re and other pieces and changes that you [indiscernible]? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes, thanks, Paul. I gave probably a little bit more PML information than people may have liked, but it's really the story is 3 components. One is what we did in the reunderwriting to reduce gross exposure across AIG. By the way, including Validus Re over the last several years. And we shed over $1 trillion of limit most of it property. And so that had an effect on exposure and PMLs at all return periods.   I think the reinsurance programs that we bought are world-class. We keep calling that out, but in a very challenging and difficult environment at 1/1, we did not compromise by taking a lot more net because of reinsurance pricing. It reflected our book. We got great partners. And as a result, we didn't really have more net in terms of overall low-return peered PMLs.   And so what I drew out in the Validus Re example, again, is on occurrence. It was the RMS model. We'll work through it. We got plenty of aggregate as to drive businesses that exists within AIG. But yes, I mean, like it's a different company. I mean, we're not going to have the tail exposure. But also at all return periods, we're going to have less cat. We've managed aggregates across the world and look at Validus Re as a very good business. But as I said, when we want to continue to reduce volatility, we do that through reinsurance. But when you have a treaty reinsurance business that is -- got a portfolio that has a lot of cat, that's harder to do. So I think the volatility, the cat loads will go down. By the very nature, we're going to lose a big part of our cat exposure. But we've been conservative on that and increased them this year and are very comfortable with our estimates and our actual results."

But I was wondering if you could talk about changes in the gap between rate increases and loss trends from the first quarter to the second quarter of this year. \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSure, Meyer. We have given guidance. So let me start with the loss cost inflation, which is still at 6.5. And you can imagine in a company like ours, I mean, it's an index. And so we look at each line of business each quarter, make minor modifications or as we did in the back half of last year just based on inflation, more meaningful adjustments.   I'm really pleased with the discipline the company is showing on driving rate above loss cost, and we've done that across the world. So the rate environment in the second quarter was very strong. I gave you the guidance on the prepared remarks of North America excluding work comp, 9%; International at 9%. The drivers for this Retail Property, excess and surplus lines and our specialty businesses, the headwind for rate in North America was Financial Lines. And it's worth noting again that we have a very big footprint.   And I mentioned in the prior question that International is not experiencing the same rate issues. And again, when I look back over the last 14 quarters, each quarter has been a positive rate increase in Financial Lines. So it's different for our International portfolio versus our domestic. And we continue to look at businesses like properties getting a lot of attention, but you can't look at that as a single quarter.   I mentioned before, cost increases on the loss cost side, inflation, cost of capital, but also the cost of reinsurance for the industry, ours was a high single-digit risk-adjusted increase at 1/1. But those reinsurance costs in the industry are going to need to play in over the course of a year or maybe even like in Europe's case, into the first quarter, absent anything happening through cat season. So I think this is the market that we're in. It's a disciplined market. The cost of capital is more expensive, and we're going to be very prudent in where we deploy capital. But I'm very comfortable that we are driving margin on a written basis, and that will continue as we get to the back half of the year. \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay. That's very helpful. One thing that you said in your prepared remarks also that surprised me was that you're seeing a huge uptick in casualty submissions in Lexington. I think we expected the property side. I was hoping if you can dig a little bit deeper into what's going on in specialty casualty. \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. Well, Lexington is just a great story. When we look at -- we had record submission count across Lexington. We drove very strong growth at the top line, but it's one of our most profitable businesses. And Dave McElroy, Lou Levinson, who leads Lexington, this has all been about driving value for our distribution partners and wholesale brokers. And we've been asking for submission activity on all lines of business.   And so when we're going to deploy property, yes, we have aggregate. Yes, the performance has been very good. Yes, the growth opportunity is there on its own. But we have been very focused on driving opportunities across the portfolio, and we're asking for the business.   And so like the submission activity is substantial. And then I think being one of the largest wholesale underwriters and respected as one of the top in terms of underwriting excellence, we're getting looks at multiple lines of business. And we have staffed up in order to take on that additional volume on the property and casualty side. So I was very pleased that the team executed as well as it did, and I expect that to continue."

Do you want it over a longer period of time? Because I mean, looking at a cat business in the second quarter and again, I'm happy to provide some detail. It was accretive by a little over 100 basis points in the quarter to a combined ratio.   But don't forget, its acquisition ratio is higher than our normal business. The loss ratio was slightly below based on dynamics going on in the market today. When I look at our overall business and ones that I continue to highlight, Lexington specialty, our property, a little more accretive than Validus Re.   So I wouldn't have the impression that it's going to be highly dilutive. Obviously, it's done really well in the first half of the year. But if I go back the last 3 to 4 years, last year is the first year we were able to publish a combined ratio below 100. And so looking at the combined ratios of the business overall, it's been a positive contributor in the first half of this year. But in terms of the business, we have a lot of business to perform better. And we have -- in terms of the index, I don't think it will materially impact us. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. And maybe just as a clarification. Your commentary, is that on a reported basis or underlying? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nBoth. But we don't break it out. But I mean, in terms of looking at it from 2018 through 2022, 2022 was the first year on a fully low to combined ratio is below 100. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. And then my second question, given the secondary and Corebridge and we're starting to see a line of sight to below 50%, can you maybe offer us a precise threshold for deconsolidation? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nNo. I can't offer you precise, but I can give you some guidance in terms of what we're thinking if that's okay. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

And we would expect to do something hopefully before year-end, subject to market conditions. I think what we have proven over time is that we want to be prepared. And so we prepared for the IPO, ended up delaying it just based on market conditions, prepared on the secondary. And so we will be prepared to go before year-end.   I think Corebridge is doing very well in its business performance, its operation as a public company. And then we have made enormous progress of getting it ready to be a standalone public company once we deconsolidate. They're executing very well on the management plan.   Again, Kevin will outline it in detail on Friday, but they're able to execute on capital management now with share repurchases as well as ordinary dividend. And so we certainly want to continue to sell down at a reasonable pace, but it's just going to be subject to market conditions and where the business is. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nPeter, I apologize. I was not really focused on the timing. I was more interested on what the precise percentage would be to see deconsolidation. Is it the second we drop below 50%? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nDepending on Board structure. But if we modify the Board structure, it would be below 50%. But on the current Board structure, we'd have to go below 45%."

I mean, I think one of the most challenging things to sort of model and forecast from the outside right now is just how you'll go about deploying the proceeds from a lot of the actions you're taking, including the separation of Corebridge. So I was just interested if there's any updated thoughts. I know in the past, you guys have kind of given the share count range. Any thoughts you'd provide or guidance as it relates to where the share count could go from here? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI think what we've outlined is still the base case. We ended up in the low 700s in terms of our share count. Sabra did a very good job of outlining the liquidity that we have and liquidity that will be coming in.   We have focused on the 4 components in a very rigorous way of making sure that we have capital and subsidiaries to drive the growth in a market that we think is very favorable. We increased our dividend this year, and so we want to continue to focus on that.   Our leverage in the low 20s, and Sabra and I both indicated, we'll do some cleanup on debt because the impact of share repurchases, you need to continue to still retire debt. And the main focus from liquidity is going to be on share repurchase, and that will be highly correlated to when we close on RenRe.   We'll be active in the market in the third quarter. And I really couldn't give you much more guidance on that other than we're really focused on the share repurchase and getting to that 600 million to 650 million shares. \n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. That makes sense. I guess a follow-up sort of in the same vein. In terms of organic deployment, I listen to the PML comments you're making and think about the volatility and how much better it is and then the fact that you guys, I think, still have below-average underwriting leverage, at least when we sort of look at like premiums to surplus, those kind of metrics. Do you have the capacity to be able to fund this greater growth, whether it's in Lexington and some other businesses in General Insurance, without using so much of the proceeds from the strategic actions? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nWe do, and it's been a big focus for us. Sabra, do you want to expand on that a little bit? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thanks. I would just note, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that the risk-based capital ratios in our U.S. pool are in the range of 470% to 480%, which is well above our target range of 400% to 420%. So we have ample capacity within the General Insurance businesses today to support growth."

Are there other and what you did on the -- what you're doing on the personal line side. Are there other pieces of the portfolio that still need additional optimization? Or are we kind of mostly through the major actions? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI think we're through most of the major actions. We have to focus more on Personal Insurance, and then we have been certainly, the -- we spent a lot of time on the ultra and high net worth business and the actions that we're taking there in terms of improving it. And we'll see that as we go to the back half of '23 and into '24.   Japan is a big focus for us, and it's a terrific business, one that has terrific scale, performs very well, needs more digital investment. And we have such a wide distribution of agents that we can scale more products. So we'll see some investment in Japan on digital workflow and digital interfacing with customers. And we've been working through that over the past 12 to 18 months. So I would expect to see improved performance there.   And then also our Global Accident & Health business, which performs very well mostly overseas in International, but that's going to have investment. And we would expect to see more growth and more profitability improvement there.   But I don't -- it's not major. It's more of just making strategic investments in order to position the portfolio to be more advantageous. So those will be the areas of focus. But after Validus Re, we had a very active quarter and certainly would not expect another one of those, but we are going to continue to try to drive improvement throughout the portfolio. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Great. And my follow-up is switching gears, thinking about AIG's long-term kind of combined ratio inclusive of other expenses. If we're thinking longer term, you've done a great job improving the loss ratio. We're clear that there's still -- you have guidance on expenses coming down.   But when you say longer term, most of the wood's been chopped in the loss ratio, and we should be thinking about overall expenses is kind of getting you to the double-digit ROE land sustainably? Or is there still loss ratio components such as maybe reserves and whatnot that could continue to improve over time? \n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nNo, I think you're thinking of it the right way. I mean, we've done an incredible job in terms of getting the portfolio that was in existence in '17 and '18 to where it is today. We know that we're an outlier on the expense ratio. That's a big part of what we're doing in the future operating model. And we'll start to show more and more evidence of that in the coming quarters and as we go into 2024.   I did mention not to repeat the first part of the answer, but I do think that there's loss ratio and combined ratio opportunity for improvement in Personal Insurance. And we're heavily focused on that in terms of its balance across all of AIG. But when we look at the improvement in ROCE, expenses is going to be a big part of it. And as we focus on getting to our future operating model, that scale and discipline around having an expense ratio that's more favorable will be a huge focus of this management team.   Okay. Thanks. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I hope you have a great day."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, and good morning.   Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.    Today's remarks may also include non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.   Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, November 3.    Finally, please note that today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination and the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the third quarter financial supplement for prior period results for Crop Risk Services and Validus Re.   With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.    In the third quarter, AIG continued to deliver exceptional results. We made significant progress in our strategic, operational and financial objectives, reflecting continued execution across our entire organization. \n\n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss the following topics:\nfirst, AIG's financial results, including Life and Retirement, and provide an update on recent divestitures; second, I will provide the results of AIG's General Insurance business; third, I will provide an update on the casualty insurance market more broadly and AIG's approach to our casualty portfolio; fourth, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy and the progress we have made this quarter. Sabra will provide more detail on AIG's balance sheet and capital position in her remarks. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge."

Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $756 million, a 30% increase.    Net premiums written in General Insurance grew 9%. General Insurance underwriting income in the quarter was $611 million, which improved over 250% from the prior year quarter. The adjusted accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, which is an outstanding result.    Our CAT loss ratio was 6.9% with $462 million of total catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, which included $70 million from Validus Re. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $139 million, reflecting favorable loss experience on our portfolio, resulting from our continued focus on underwriting discipline.    The Life and Retirement business also delivered strong results in the third quarter with continued sales momentum and spread expansion. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion, driven by strong Fixed Index Annuity sales, which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter.    September marked the 1-year anniversary of Corebridge's initial public offering. And since the IPO, Corebridge has returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders and is well on track to its committed payout ratio.   With respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, we continue to evaluate options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders and our other stakeholders. We're very proud of the achievements that Corebridge has delivered towards its operational separation as a public company, and we remain committed to reducing our ownership and eventually a full separation.   Turning to AIG's balance sheet. During the quarter, AIG returned over $1 billion to shareholders through $785 million of common stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. In addition, we purchased $170 million of common stock in October. We deployed $289 million to retire Validus Re debt prior to the close of the transaction yesterday. And we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of parent liquidity.   During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our strategic repositioning as we have further simplified our portfolio, which we've talked about over the past several quarters. Yesterday, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for which we received a total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a pre-close dividend and approximately $275 million at RenaissanceRe common stock. This divestiture streamlines our business model, simplifies our portfolio and further reduces our volatility.    Prior to closing the Validus Re transaction, we entered into an agreement with Enstar Group to provide AIG with protection against any adverse development on the 95% portion of Validus Re's loss reserves that AIG retains exposure to. The cost will be included in the gain on sale in the fourth quarter.    Enstar will provide $400 million of limit for an adverse development cover in excess of carried loss reserves on assumed reinsurance contracts underwritten by Validus Re with respect to accident year 2022 and prior. This ADC limit provides additional protection against downside exposure to reserves in excess of the expected redundancy to a modeled confidence level above the 90th percentile. Importantly, while we believe this ADC is prudent to mitigate the risk of any future adverse reserve development, we will benefit from any future favorable reserve development.   In August, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare to AXA for EUR 650 million, which closed on October 31. Proceeds to Corebridge, net of purchase price adjustments and deal-related expenses, will be approximately $730 million. It was announced that the proceeds will be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders as of November 13.    In September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc for GBP 460 million. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. We anticipate that the proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Both transactions streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow the company to focus on its Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States.    Turning to General Insurance, gross premiums written were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from prior year quarter. Net premiums written were $6.5 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial grew 6%, and Global Personal grew 16% from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial net premiums written increased 5% in the third quarter.    There are many variables in this quarter, and I want to provide more detail. The key businesses that drove growth were Lexington's core business, excluding Lexington programs, grew over 25% in the quarter, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 33%; and wholesale property, which grew 27%. Glatfelter grew 12%, and Retail Property grew 11%.   In terms of headwinds, in 2022, we made the underwriting decision to not renew 2 large Lexington programs. We took this action because we believe that these programs had meaningful CAT exposure in peak zones. And we do not believe the appropriate CAT loads were reflected in the pricing. These programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those nonrenewals tempered overall growth in Lexington.   Lexington program's net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe, over time, we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk-adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter. The impact of the net premiums written associated with these 2 programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter.   Also offsetting growth in North America was Financial Lines, which declined 11%, accounting for approximately 20% of North America Commercial Lines net premiums written in the quarter. In North America Financial Lines, large account public D&O remains competitive as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market.   Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business in our excess book was down year-over-year as we were very disciplined in the current environment.    Rate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing. In primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remained flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to Financial Lines. We have a global business with scale, focused on underwriting profit over top line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.    In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 7%, primarily driven by property, which was up 13%; global specialty, which was up 12%, led by energy and marine; and Talbot, which was up 7%.   Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 87% in its in-force portfolio. North America was up 200 basis points to 87%, and International was up 300 basis points to 88%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.    And across Global Commercial, we continue to see very strong new business, which was approximately $1 billion in the third quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $516 m"

North America Commercial produced new business of $516 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 27% if you exclude Financial Lines. This growth was driven by Lexington Casualty, which saw excellent new business growth of over 90%, as well as Western World, which grew over 50%.    Retail Property grew new business by 26%, and retail casualty grew new business by 25%. This was offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by about 30% as a result of our underwriting discipline.   International Commercial produced new business of $532 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased almost 50% year-over-year, and Global Specialty, which grew new business by over 40%, and it was balanced across the portfolio.    Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, rate increased 5.4% in the third quarter or 6% excluding workers' compensation. Exposure in the quarter added 3 points, bringing the total pricing change, excluding workers' comp, to 9%.   Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 15%, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases, led by Lexington wholesale property, which was up 28%, Retail Property was up 27% and admitted excess casualty was up 12%. Financial Lines rate was down 8%.    In International Commercial, rate increased 4%, and the exposure increase was 2%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 13%; energy, which was up 10%; and Talbot, which was up 9%.   Turning to Personal Insurance, net premiums written increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America. In North America, Personal net premiums written increased 59%. Similar to last quarter, the increase was driven by business underwritten on behalf of PCS, offset by decreases in Travel and Warranty.    In the third quarter, AIG's net premiums written from PCS increased by over 100%, benefiting from an increase in gross premiums written and a reduction in quota share sessions. And as expected, the lag in earned premium growth continued to dissipate, providing operating leverage and a reduced expense ratio, primarily in general operating expenses.   The high and ultra high net worth business also had significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio, benefiting from improved pricing in our admitted business and transitioning more business to the non-admitted market. We expect PCS to continue to improve its financial performance and provide more operating leverage in the fourth quarter and into 2024.   In International Personal, net premiums written increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto, travel, and that reflects the rebound post-pandemic and Japan personal property. The accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, improved 560 basis points. Overall, we're pleased with the International Personal improvement year-over-year.   Shifting to combined ratios. The General Insurance third quarter combined ratio was 90.5%, a 680 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. Accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.   Global Commercial had an outstanding performance with third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 81.7%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including CAT, was 89.7%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.    The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83%. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 79.7%, both of which were exceptional outcomes.   We would like to provide a perspective both with and without Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. As I said, the third quarter Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 81.7%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 86.6%. Excluding Validus Re from the third quarter results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio would essentially have been flat, and the calendar year combined ratio would have improved by slightly over 100 basis points from the third quarter to 85.4%.    And for the first 9 months, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 83.6%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 87.6%. Excluding Crop and Validus Re from the 9-month period results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, would have increased by 70 basis points to 84.3%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by 50 basis points to 88.1%.    Global Personal reported a third quarter accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 99%, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter due in part to the North America PCS business.   Related to casualty liability and the excess casualty market, in particular in the United States, the level of narrative has increased over the last several years, driven in part by multiple mass tort events as well as rising economic and social inflation. The latter has been fueled by an exponential increase in third-party litigation funding, average severity trend increases and a precipitous rise in jury awards following the lull during the pandemic.   Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion. We have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity.   We have filed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today.    As I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy.    Today, our global casualty portfolio represents 12% of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums written. The North America segment represents 55%, and the International segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio.   In North America casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018. Our average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses, have more than doubled since 2018.   In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability, rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250%, remaining well above loss cost trends.    In addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility. What once was $100 million net exposure for AIG, there's now a maximum net on any one claim of $15 million in International and $11.5 million in North America.   And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the [ 1,000 ] return periods. This adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses.   Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for U.S. long-tail commercial lines.

      "raw_bytes": ", the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for U.S. long-tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a $25 billion -- excess of $25 billion on payments made on or after January 1, 2016, for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left or $7.2 billion at the 80% level.   Conflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments particularly recently that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG.    We prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last 5 years, executing on the fundamentals of disciplined and consistent underwriting, being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes.   Building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG. Insurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation. However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points and pricing.    Our business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early, and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio, and we're well positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace.    Turning to capital management. We use a balanced framework that remains focused on having ample capital in our insurance company subsidiaries to support organic growth in our business, continuing share repurchases, debt reduction in line with the lower end of the targets we provided and dividend increases. Lastly, we will consider compelling inorganic growth opportunities to meet our strategic objectives should they emerge.   We finished the third quarter with $3.6 billion of available liquidity prior to receiving the proceeds of the sale of Validus Re or the special dividend from the sale of Laya Healthcare. Together, they should contribute approximately another $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Our primary use of proceeds will be on share repurchases. We plan to accelerate our repurchase activity this quarter and as we enter 2024, and we expect to reduce debt outstanding to further strengthen the balance sheet.   We remain mindful of our leverage as a key consideration with our accelerated share repurchases. We expect to execute on the current share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion, which will reduce shares outstanding to close to 600 million shares subject to market conditions.   Related to return on common equity, as we have outlined on our prior calls, we remain very focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress at all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment and how we are positioning AIG for the future.   I want to provide a few observations. In the last 90 days, we've continued to improve our underwriting results on an accident year and calendar year basis. We made recent leadership changes in General Insurance, which have effectively eliminated a management layer from the business, and we will continue this process throughout the organization in 2024.   We have strengthened the capital position of insurance company subsidiaries to enable continued profitable growth. We've moved into the final stages of the operational separation for Corebridge. We have announced and closed several divestitures and have repositioned the portfolio to support our strategy for the future. We have accelerated the progress we're making on our capital management strategy and have created a strong liquidity position.   The catalyst to achieving our targets remains the deconsolidation of Corebridge. This will allow AIG to simplify its business, eliminate duplication by combining our General Insurance business and our corporate functions, and create a leaner operating model for the future.   Before I turn it over to Sabra, I'd like to add a few more details on the closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe. In January of 2018, AIG announced it was acquiring Validus Holdings to position it for future growth and profitability improvement. Over the last several years, we reshaped Validus Re's portfolio by reducing the catastrophe exposure in certain U.S. peak zones while diversifying the business significantly to develop a more balanced portfolio in both property and casualty reinsurance in order to improve profitability.   Validus Re posted its first accident year combined ratio below 100% in 2022. And as we look back, we are grateful for the hard work, determination and perseverance of the team to dramatically improve the quality of the portfolio, particularly year-to-date in 2023, and it's evident in its performance today.   We are very proud of Validus Re's results and are pleased that the company acquiring Validus Re is RenaissanceRe. Through Kevin O'Donnell and his leadership team's terrific work, RenaissanceRe has become one of the world's most well-respected reinsurers. We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with RenaissanceRe, which will be further enhanced as we become an investor in RenRe's capital partner vehicles, allowing us to benefit from their future performance.   With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's third quarter, including General Insurance reserves, net investment income, Life and Retirement results and balance sheet and capital management.   Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was $1.2 billion, up 80% from 3Q '22, for an annualized adjusted ROCE of 8.5%. AATI per diluted share was $1.61, up 92%, reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases over the last year. The earnings growth resulted from the 82% increase in General Insurance adjusted pretax income to $1.4 billion, driven by top line growth, improved underwriting results and higher investment income.   It's important to note that while Life and Retirement also had strong earnings, AIG's ownership of Corebridge decreased to 65.6% this quarter compared to 90.1% before the IPO. And therefore, our results include a lower percentage of their consolidated earnings than last year. In total, Corebridge contributed about $32 million to the $514 million increase in AIG's adjusted after-tax income.   Turning to General Insurance. Peter summarized our underwriting results, but I want to cover prior year development and reserves in more detail. In the quarter, General Insurance prior year development, net of reinsurance, totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover. About $129 million, including the ADC gain, resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items like catastrophes.   The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of loss reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total. The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for International Casualty and Financial Lines, North America Financial Lines and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable.   Consistent wi"

      "raw_bytes": "r was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable.   Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. We believe that our changes in underwriting standards reduced limits, higher attachment points on primary limits, tightened terms and conditions and better risk selection are driving the improved experience, particularly in financial lines and casualty.   Nevertheless, our philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and to allow time for favorable trends in recent accident years to mature, particularly given the impact of COVID on recent years. Therefore, this quarter's favorable development is generally from older accident years or from short-tail lines like property where physical damage claims come in quickly.   In Financial Lines, changes from the DVRs were immaterial. North America had modest adverse development on an older Lexington architect and engineers book, offset by favorability in Canada. U.K. Financial Lines had slight adverse development, reflecting emerged experience on older D&O and professional indemnity claims, partially offset by favorable experience in Europe and Japan.   We also reviewed International casualty lines this quarter. Peter discussed our changes in underwriting limits and reinsurance on our global casualty book. I would add that we also evaluate economic and social inflation trends as well as our potential exposure to mass torts across the total book and hold reserves to address those items.   This quarter, we had adverse development in U.K. and European casualty, principally from commercial auto in France and large loss experience on a few older claims in both the U.K. and Europe. Consistent with prior trends, the DVRs for workers' compensation were favorable both for years covered by the ADC and after.   Finally, property lines and Personal Insurance had favorable development in both North America and International, while we had about $23 million of adverse development on prior year catastrophes. We will complete the balance of annual DVRs next quarter, which cover about $6 billion of reserves on a number of smaller lines.   Net investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter, driven principally by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. The average new money yield on fixed maturities and loans was 5.88% this quarter, about 145 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities, and it was about 130 and 150 basis points higher in General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively. Year-to-date, the total new money yield is about 202 basis points higher than sales and maturities.   The portfolio yield in General Insurance increased 9 basis points sequentially and 88 basis points over the last year with net investment income growth of 30%. The L&R investment income rose 23%, and the portfolio yield improved 9 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively. Based on the current treasury yield curve, we expect continued pickup in portfolio yields, particularly in L&R, given the longer duration of its portfolio.   Alternative investment income totaled $26 million for an annualized return of about 1%, better than the losses last year, but below our long-term experience and outlook and down sequentially. Private equity returns are the principal driver of sequential decline in alternative returns this year as we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds over the last year. Private equity is reported on a 1-quarter lag based on when we receive the fund's financial reports. So this quarter's financial results reflect second quarter margins.   Our investment portfolios have strong credit performance and remain well diversified and highly rated. We continue to monitor commercial real estate closely. Debt service coverage ratios are strong, including in the office sector. The primary impact has been on loan-to-value ratios and real estate equity valuations rather than delinquencies or defaults. We continue to work on near-term maturities, and almost all 2023 scheduled maturities have been addressed.   Life and Retirement once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year, driven by continued investment spread expansion and strong sales, particularly in Fixed Index Annuities. Underwriting margins overall remain attractive. And on a sequential quarter basis, fee income and investment spreads improved.   During the quarter, the annual actuarial assumptions update was completed, resulting in a modest $22 million increase in APTI, mostly in the Life Insurance segment, compared to a $29 million increase last year. Individual Retirement APTI increased $195 million or 52% over the prior year quarter from base spread expansion and general account product growth.   The fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% this quarter as operations caught up on a backlog of surrender requests from earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined sequentially each month with continued improvement in October.   Group Retirement APTI was flat year-over-year as higher fee income and alternative investment income were offset by lower other yield enhancement income and higher general operating expenses or GOE. Net outflows included one large $1 billion plan, which was mostly in mutual funds and, therefore, was not material to earnings.   Life Insurance APT was also flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower policy fees and a lower favorable impact from the annual assumptions update, partially offset by higher net investment income.   Institutional Markets APTI decreased $8 million or 10% due to less favorable mortality experience. Sales increased 19%, supported by record production of $1.9 billion, partially offset by lower PRT sales, which are highly variable quarter-to-quarter.   Turning to Other Operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $149 million, driven by lower corporate and other GOE and higher short-term investment income. In addition, third quarter 2022 had investment losses on a legacy portfolio that was sold in 4Q '22.   Corporate GOE was $243 million and included $68 million for Corebridge. Excluding Corebridge, AIG corporate GOE decreased $56 million from the prior year. We remain on track to reduce 2023 corporate GOE by at least $100 million, including a higher allocation to General Insurance that has not had a material impact on the expense ratio due to expense discipline across the company.   Moving to the balance sheet. Third quarter 2023 estimated risk-based capital ratios remain above our target ranges. The General Insurance U.S. pool RBC is in the high 400s, while Life and Retirement is above its 400% target. At September 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 25.9%, including $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt.   Our approach to capital management is unchanged. We will continue to balance share repurchases and debt reduction while also focusing on increasing common stock dividends. As Peter indicated, from the Validus and Laya sales, we expect about $3.7 billion of additional parent liquidity in the fourth quarter. We have significant financial flexibility, which we intend to use for both additional share repurchases and debt reduction.   Based on current average daily trading volumes, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter or $500 million a month, which we will begin when the market window opens after earnings. We expect to continue at this rate into 2024, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sales proceeds and General Insurance dividends. I"

In the fourth quarter, we also plan to accelerate debt repayment to rightsize our debt stock for our target deconsolidated leverage ratio.   Turning to our ROCE target. We remain laser-focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 8.8% and 12.0% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement.   Last quarter, I provided a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity ex AOCI, excluding Corebridge, of about $40 billion, including deferred tax assets from the financial crisis era net operating losses. That's the capital supporting our General Insurance business and parent operations today, excluding our stake in Corebridge.   With the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases and debt reduction, the current pro forma estimate of AIG equity, excluding Corebridge, is about $37 billion, including $4 billion of deferred tax assets, or $33 billion of adjusted shareholders' equity, which is the number we use for calculating adjusted ROCE.   Considering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure and to drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.   With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Sabra.

I guess, what's the process for ensuring that the adverse development in International Commercial doesn't actually reflect social inflation problem and that it's individual cases? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nMeyer, thanks for the question. Sabra, do you want to cover? That's just a quick overview of -- Meyer mentioned the International and some of the inflation impact from reserves. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes, certainly. And let me first start by explaining what the DVR process is. So DVR is a once-a-year deep-dive into our reserves. But each quarter, we do an actual versus expected analysis. So we do make adjustments to reserves on lines of business during the ordinary part of the year, but the deep-dive is where we really drill down into the lines in great detail.   This quarter, as I noted, we had International casualty. The development that you see is related to very specific books or -- and I'm sorry, I'm getting a little feedback on the line here. So I don't know, Meyer, maybe you need to mute. Anyway, the International Commercial Lines is very much related to specific cases and judgments around settlements.   And as I said and would also note in Peter's comment, these are generally from older accident years where we are exposed to much larger limits. So therefore, when you have a particular claim that goes against you, they do -- they are lumpy and they tend to be large. So what I would just say again is that we look at our book consistently during the course of the year, do a deep-dive once a year and then make some assessments based on specific facts and circumstances. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Sabra. Meyer, do you have another question? \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nYes, just a quick one. I know there's a lot of moving parts in North America Personal. I was hoping you could give us some sense of maybe true underlying underwriting results and the path to profitability in that segment. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nGreat. Thank you. As we've talked about before, it's a business in transition. We're not pleased with the overall printed results. But we had outlined in the past that it's complicated. 2023 would be a transition year, particularly with PCS, which we see a lot of net premium written coming in each quarter. The earned will follow, and so we should have some significant benefit on the ratios as we fully earn in the premium over the coming quarters.   When we look at fourth quarter 2023 and into 2024, we will see the mix of business change. And so therefore, the overall GOE and acquisition expenses should come down. We would see the accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, slightly go up just because of the mix of what PCS is underwriting.   We did have some onetime items that I won't go into in the quarter that were headwinds in the Travel and Warranty business. But those businesses are going to have to contribute more as we get into 2024, and we're looking at the entire business model in order to improve their financial results.   So we recognize the overall segment needs to improve. We believe we have the sort of business strategic alternatives in place, and we're going to be executing them. And again, it's just a choppy year as we make that transition."

Yes, thanks, Gary, for the question. And I'll have Dave make some specific comments. When we talk about the headwinds in Financial Lines, and again, Dave will go into it, but it's primarily North America and it's primarily excess. We've done a tremendous job over the past couple of years to reposition the business and not only with the underwriting, but also with cumulative rate. And so we still think there's margins, still think our scale and balance across the world is a competitive advantage. And when we talk about some of the challenges in Financial Lines, it's really specific to North America.   Dave, do you want to provide some context in a little bit more detail, please? \n\nDavid McElroy - Vice Chair, General Insurance (AIG):\nYes. Yes, thank you, Peter. And thank you, Gary. The -- this is obviously a business that I've got a lot of scar tissue in over a lot of 40 years of this. And I sometimes think of my career credibility tied into fixing this book, but I am very confident with where we have positioned the book, okay?   The -- we've taken a cautious approach to the large account public company D&O business and particularly excess, Gary, that you've referred to. So we're aware of the consequences of chasing volume, okay? We've seen companies go close to the sun, they burn out, where that's our sophistication.   So the -- what we're doing here, private -- public company, D&O, the market, the private, their primary market is, frankly, a stable market, okay? It's holding up well. Cumulative rate increases, even though they went up 120% from the '18 to '21 year, they're trending around 85% today, and they're holding, okay? This is going to be about a story about excess.   And I do want to frame this that in that primary market, there are a couple of key points that are also holding and that's retentions are holding up very nicely, okay? There hasn't been an erosion in the self-insured retentions that clients are keeping. And we look at that as sort of an acting hedge against legal cost inflation.   And then the other fact that I've always been worried about is the arms race back to limits. And this industry did a great job, and I believe there was respect for this volatility by taking 25 million limits down to 10s and 15s down to 5s. So even today, our portfolio is in the 80% to 90% range of those limits on a primary basis. And therefore, the arms race to increasing limits, which is often led by those who may not understand the volatility, that has not happened, okay? So that's a win for the primary.   I'm going to be -- I'll call out the excess because the battles and the competition in this market are classic, okay? These are tranches above $50 million. It's a commodity. We're seeing more competition there. And we're -- what we're going to do is we're going to do what we've been doing, reducing our limits, reducing our policy count. Our renewal retention right now is actually running 11 points lower than what would be normal in a standard market. And we're going to continue that way, not only on a policy count basis, but an aggregate -- in an aggregate basis.   The 2 things I just called out, everybody knows that I've lived in this business for a bit, I'd call out the claim environment in the market, okay? The market may be mistiming the pricing of excess layers, okay? The plaintiffs' bar has circled back to large account. Securities class actions, they're actually up this year and looking more like the '16 to '19 cohort years, which are problematic for the industry versus the 2022 years. So it's one to be concerned about because that verticality of loss will actually affect the excess towers that are not going to be making money at [ $8,000 a mill ].   So this environment is not conducive to be putting out limits excess at those layers. And maybe the more important thing is about our AIG global book, okay? It is a formidable asset. And we had the heightened scrutiny on the North American book. We're confident around what that looks like. But the International book is a franchise that you could not duplicate in generations.   It's performed better than the U.S. It's got -- it's actually larger than the U.S. book. It actually represents 60% of our total volume in the world. It has more geographic spread, particularly in Europe and Asia Pac. And it actually catches more private company business, SME business and middle-market cyber business than you might think in North America. So -- and other than some of the London subscription pricing, the pricing pressure there has been de minimis. And in fact, our rates are holding up better than 2023.   So I always feel like when I got here, I didn't understand the impact and the power, but the AIG global franchise is an incredible asset, and it also is one that we have coordinated better to make sure that any sort of U.S. exposures are controlled collectively by both of us. So in some special asset, it's been built over 2 generations. We like what it is. We like the portfolio today. And it's -- there's been 5 years of work to frame this book to where we all trust it. And we trust the recent years for their performance, okay?   Kicking back to you, Peter. I know I went long. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThank you, David. Very thorough. Appreciate it. Gary... \n\nGary Ransom - Analyst (Dowling & Partners):\nYes, that's a very thorough answer. I'm good. I mean I'm good with that."

I appreciate there's volume constraints, and it's good to have some guidance around how much capacity you can do in terms of buybacks a quarter. I did want to probe you a bit on to what degree, if at all, that, that considers further kind sell-down at Corebridge and sort of further special dividends coming out of Corebridge and so forth.   I mean I think the math would tell us that you could potentially do more than $1.5 billion a quarter, particularly for like next year over 4 quarters. And I'm just a little sensitive to it because it affects sort of accretion dilution and just the lag and what to expect. So I want to make sure we have appropriate expectations around the timing of that share count reduction and so forth. So any help is very appreciated. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes, thanks very much for the question. I mean we tried to provide between Sabra's script and in my prepared remarks a lot of detail on capital management and also the additional liquidity where we're going to have from the special dividend from the Validus Re disposition and overall how we intend to use those proceeds. And it remains the same is we want to make sure that we provide ample capital in our subsidiaries to continue to drive growth. We still think there's great opportunities for us in the businesses that we're in to drive top line growth and continue to drive profit growth and more margin, and that is our primary focus.   We've also given guidance in terms of the share count. And clearly, with the 7.5 billion of share authorization and now with the liquidity that we've outlined, we have a path towards that lower end of the 600 million. And so when we think about the next several quarters, certainly that's going to be the priority.   Sabra and I alluded to the fact that we still want to clean up a little bit of debt and make sure that we're at the lower end of the ratios, but also reflecting that buying back shares is going to have an impact on your leverage and making certain that we are being thoughtful, prudent in getting ahead of that.   In terms of the Corebridge sell-down, I mean we've been very methodical. Certainly, we would like to do something in the fourth quarter. We continue to look at all the different alternatives in terms of size and how we can do it. And it will be a priority for us to focus on when we conclude this call and start to focus into next week.   I mean Corebridge has done a terrific job of setting itself up as a public company. And they're ready for deconsolidation in terms of their operations, but we want to make certain that we are very thoughtful in the current environment. And again, we'll use those proceeds to continue to accelerate what we've outlined on the capital management.   I would expect, as we do a secondary and we get on future calls, we'll update and refresh some of the capital structure and also our guidance to see if we need to revise it. But I think that's probably all I can give you at this point. \n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nYes, that's helpful. Second question I had is on the, I guess, the operating company level on the RemainCo General Insurance side of things. Where do you see those metrics over time? I mean one of the things that I've looked at is just decomposing the ROE, and the underwriting leverage itself seems lower at AIG, which made all the sense in the world as you guys had more volatility.   But as you sort of expressed in your opening comments and as you guys have sort of proven out, the volatility is significantly reduced. So where can that go to over time? What are the right metrics for us to look at? Is it RBC premium to surplus? Any help on thinking through how much more business you could write on the equity you have? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. Well, we could write significantly more business based on the capital we have in the subsidiaries today. We have a lot of moving pieces. I mean, certainly, selling Validus Re gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position the portfolio for next year.   And so I'll give you a couple of examples of that is that we underwrite property business where we pick up CAT across the world, whether it's Japan, our International business through Lexington, through Talbot, through our retail in North America. But we always had to be very cautious in terms of the overall volatility in terms of how we're correlated with Validus Re, including our reinsurance purchasing where we had certain retentions that might be lower than what our risk tolerance would assume within North America and International. We bought ILWs that benefited the group.   And so like as we think about how we reposition the portfolio, I believe we have a significant amount of aggregate. We have a significant amount of capital. We have businesses that are positioned to propel growth and want to focus on that.   Now maybe the first part of your question is, what type of leverage or how can you improve it? We recognize we have an expense issue. I mean when we look at the overall combination of our corporate expenses plus the expenses that sit in the business, yes, there's a little bit of a mix issue that when you look at some of the Personal Insurance, which are great businesses, and International may have a little bit more acquisition and GOE, but by and large, we need to get expenses out.   And that's the focus. That will be the leverage in terms of contributing to ROE and also getting a future-state business that is leaner and does not have duplication across the world. I mean so that's the work we've been doing this year. We will be positioned pre-deconsolidation to start implementing that operating model.   But I think the leverage is we have enough capital to grow, and we'll continue to grow the top line where we like the risk-adjusted returns, less volatility because we don't have a reinsurance business anymore. So we can do things a little bit differently on the primary side. And we know we have expenses that need to get out, and we're going to get them out, and that's going to drive us north of the 10% ROCE."

So Peter, you used the T word, trillion, you said $1.4 trillion limit reduction. So just curious, I think David gave us a flavor of this answer, but does that -- is there a way to frame what percentage limit reduction your average -- this average policy is? It sounded like David said it's over 50% in some of those Financial Lines?  And just related, like how is that -- was AIG an outlier previously and you moved towards the market? Or just how has this changed your competitive position in the marketplace? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. I think you recognize how we were able to reduce volatility. When you have -- I have to even pause when I have to write out trillion because it's a big number. And $1.4 trillion of limit, I don't think that's been done in our business before, and then reposition the portfolio to drive significant profitability improvement.   It absolutely was an outlier. Its gross limit deployment and net limit deployment was significant relative to any of its competitors. And in order to have the type of predictable results we've been able to produce over the past couple of years, when you see the relative improvement as well as absolute improvement, we are really proud of that. You had to take out the volatility, which was the outsized limits, not only from a gross perspective, and we recognize that.   While we talk about it is that, yes, we're a buyer of reinsurance, it's strategic, it matters, but it's not what's driving the results. The driver of the results is the gross underwriting and the overall reduction. Everywhere you look, property, casualty, financial lines, everything is 50% plus of reduction of gross limits. And then you add on reinsurance to temper volatility, that's how we've been able to position the portfolio to have not only significantly improved results, less volatility, it's also very sustainable. And we believe that there's opportunities for further improvement. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Great. And my last, if I may, is on -- there's a lot of leadership changes over the past, right, years and quarters. I think Sabra used the term simplify structure. I guess any color you can offer on are we -- is the structure simplified, we're on baseball inning 4 or 9? Or any comments would be helpful. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nSure. Look, we've had a lot of change over the last 5 years. When I look at our overall attrition, it's at all-time low. We've had a couple of senior executives that we brought in to position the organization for the future and believe that the underwriting structure that we put forward is going to be with us for a couple of years. It's going to drive the performance that we've become accustomed to. And we'll continue to bring in skill sets in the organization that supplement what we already have in order to position us for the future.   So I'm like really very pleased. As I said, we have very low attrition, continue to upgrade talent across the organization. And people want to come work here, which is a really positive attribute of the organization and how we position it for the future.   So thank you. I do have one closing remark. First of all, I'm very proud, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their efforts and all that they've done to progress our strategic plans and deliver consistently strong financial results. Very proud of them.   I would like to say a few words about our former Chief Financial Officer, Shane Fitzsimons, who passed away on Friday, October 27. Shane had a brilliant career. He was highly thought of in the global business community and quickly earned the trust and respect of the insurance industry, which is not easy to do.   He was a cherished colleague here at AIG. Shane brought energy, integrity and a very positive attitude that was both contagious and inspiring. He's a big reason why AIG is where it is today. Shane was a great friend to many of us, and we're so grateful for all that he did for AIG, our stakeholders and our colleagues.   Thank you, and have a great day."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.    Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.    Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Thursday, February 15.    Finally, today's remarks, as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance, are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination, the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the fourth quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re.    With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.    We had a very strong fourth quarter, which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence; repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures; made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including 3 secondary sell-downs; delivered disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios; and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year.    In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income and excellent execution of our balanced capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding. For the full year 2023, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022. AIG overall produced an adjusted return on common equity of 9% for the year, up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG.   During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life Retirement business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals. And finally, I'll share some thoughts on how we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations.    AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global Commercial grew 5%, and Global Personal grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial would have grown 11%.    In North America Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter led by Retail Property, which grew 32%; Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial Lines, which was lower by 13%. In International Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as International Property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by International Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%.    In the fourth quarter, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its in-force portfolio as well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty, Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot.    Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, overall rate increased 4% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%. In North America Commercial, if you exclude Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter. And with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend.    North America Commercial rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%; Retail Property, which was up 19%; and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 2 points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 12% and marine, which was up 8%.    Turning to Personal Insurance. Fourth quarter net premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by North America. In North America Personal, net premiums written increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters in 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our high net worth business. And as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024.    Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic repositioning and was, in many ways, our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds, including a pre-close dividend.    Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The chang"

Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns.    We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our high net worth business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company.    We completed 3 secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash, we worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the U.K. Life business. In 2023, AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends and $315 million of share repurchases. At the end of 2023, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52%.    In 2023, we continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%.    On August 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization of $7.5 billion. At the year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities.    Turning to the full year results for General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year.    Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 83.3% for the full year, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year.    Excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%.    In Global Personal, the full year accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 99.3%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in Personal Insurance. North America Commercial grew 5% and International Commercial grew 6% year-over-year.    A couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remain very focused on these businesses and made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability.    Lexington grew its net premiums written by 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention, which was 80%, $1 billion of new business and rate increases of approximately 18%.    Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade credit and aviation, grew its net premiums written 10% year-over-year driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business and rate increases of 7% for the year.    Also, there are 2 parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our net premiums written growth would have been 10%.    Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to not renew 2 programs that had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We do not believe that the premium increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these 2 programs delivered an acceptable return. The decision to nonrenew impacted the gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically as well as the Global Commercial business throughout 2023. If you exclude Financial Lines and these 2 programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year.    It's worth providing a little bit more detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our public directors and officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio to being very prudent on large account excess layers, where there is significant exposure to vertical loss, and these layers are highly commoditized where typically the best price wins.    We've spoken about the cumulative rate change in Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for Financial Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on and our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively.    Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year.    Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last 2 years, and analyzing and quantifying changes and the portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex.    Currently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency in the last year is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can be complicated and is often inconsistent. I want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry-best practice.    To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost of capital year-over-year and any model changes from vendor model output such as RMS to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed.    Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years, many programs have gone from an all-risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.  To correctly calculate the risk-adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on "

This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to the volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change.    Given the complexity of these calculations, the methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline. When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023.    Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past 7 years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last 7 years, there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils.    The headline is that we were able to significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million and our core property treaties, excluding Validus Re, have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year.    Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model [ detachment ] point is lower, and the exhaust limit is higher.    Our International Property cat per current structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million.    We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan decreasing, the model probability of attaching our cat reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023.    Our property cat aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone supplement dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio.   Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible. And Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million.    Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year. For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintained our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market-leading underwriting expertise and position in the market.    Turning to casualty. The challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic and litigation funding in the U.S. were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1.    For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of reunderwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today.    Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past 2 years, given inflationary dynamics.    I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in 4 of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been 6 years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent 5 calendar years.    Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our Casualty lines, excluding workers' compensation, averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and '17, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense.    We significantly strengthened the reserves by over $1 billion for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017 at an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability and commercial auto using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures.    Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting 2018 that provides us with substantial amount of vertical protection.   Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retained lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams.    I'll now turn to discuss our efforts to create a future state business structure for AIG post deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post deconsolidation."

As we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created through this program to generate $500 million of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million of onetime spend to achieve these savings. As part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized.   In 2023, we began this work, as we've moved approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into General Insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within General Insurance.    Throughout the year, we've built efficiencies into our business, which have allowed general insurers to absorb these costs. We've already begun to make meaningful progress against our $500 million savings target and have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline.    Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025. As we are approaching the final steps of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interest of our stakeholders.    Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation. Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before. Our insurance company subsidiaries continue to have excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023 and would expect to see in the future. We made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year-end 2021, we've reduced over 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction.    The primary focus in 2024 will be on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject to market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range.    Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve the low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG Board increased the dividend in 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG, and we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy in 2024.    And lastly, as I enter my seventh year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has entering 2024. We now have a terrific business. Global Commercial, which we've been working on for years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry.    While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG's strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios and a company that has been able to distinguish itself amongst our clients and distribution partners.    In Personal Insurance, we will continue to make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business and our high net worth business where we anticipate continued growth and more importantly, profitability improvement.    With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results. But first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma.    With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of noncontrolling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on Pages 8 and 11.    When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments. Corebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials.    If we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current GAAP carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities.    The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors, and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity.    For simplicity, in this example, we used Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value. But the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates.    As a very high-level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share.    However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value.    Now let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimates that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders' equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus Re, to be used in evaluating the ROCE target.    At December 31, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity was approximately $53 billion. With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders' equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares.    To get to the E, we subtract the value of Corebridge shares. And for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year-end parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest and other parent expenses as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity of about $33 billion invested in our business plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10%-plus target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful.    Now I will turn to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter consol"

Fourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General Insurance net investment income was 38%, while Life and Retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement.    Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in L&R.    With higher reinvestment rates, the yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls and prepayments, rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in 4Q '22 and up 9 basis points sequentially. L&R's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in 4Q '22 and up 10 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year but less improvement sequentially, given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current shape of the yield curve.   In contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter for an annualized return of 3.9%. L&R's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year.    Turning to General Insurance. As Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The 4Q '23 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. And the accident year combined ratio ex cats was 87.9%, 50 basis points better.    Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International.    The fourth quarter included only 1 month of Validus Re due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus Re from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial Lines calendar year combined ratio would have been 85.1%, 30 basis points lower than reported. The accident year combined ratio ex cats would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher.    The fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for Global Personal Insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than 4Q '22. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher driven by the repositioning of the high net worth business, which made significant progress in 2023.    Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in 4Q '22 as improved accident year results, including catastrophe losses, were offset by lower favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year. The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico.    For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses, excluding Validus Re, would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively. Favorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million in 4Q '22. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in 4Q '22.    Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia-Ukraine related claims, offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes.    Turning to L&R. Fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year driven by base spread expansion, strong sales and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement together widened 23 basis points in the quarter.    Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from 4Q '22. For the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included in AIG adjusted after-tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year-end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings in our adjusted after-tax income declined 20%.    Turning to other operations. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pretax loss improved by $52 million from 4Q '22 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge.    On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion driven by 19% growth in General Insurance APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.    Moving to the balance sheet. Book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year-end 2022 and up 16% from September 30, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year-end, up 1% from year-end 2022 and down 2% for September 30, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases and Corebridge secondary sales.    At December 31, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year-end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20% to 25% range upon deconsolidation.    As Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards our 10%-plus ROCE goal this year. 2023 full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022 and was 12.5% in General Insurance and 11.5% in L&R. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the 4 levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions and look forward to updating you on our progress.    With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Sabra. Michelle, we're ready for questions."

I appreciate the color, Peter, you gave us on the continued improvement. Anything -- looks like this quarter, specifically, though, it took -- it was a bit higher than expected. Anything we should be thinking about? Or I don't know, if it's profit share, given the excellent loss ratio or just anything, any noise in there or seasonality? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Mike. We outlined in my script that the business has been taking a lot of additional costs. Think about cyber and usage on the cloud. And so that might have been held centrally in the past. That has now been put into the business. And so you see that they're absorbing most of it, but there is some timing on that.   Also in Personal Insurance, there is a lot of noise in the quarter. There's some onetime true-up adjustments. There's also some profit sharing, as you mentioned, in some of our Personal Insurance businesses. And so -- and there was also some catch-up on some of the reinsurance on earned premium.   So I'm not concerned at all about the uptick in expenses. It was very nominal. When I look at what the business has actually absorbed in terms of increased costs year-over-year, they've really built capacity to be able to invest in the future. And the fourth quarter reflected that, but there was a little bit of noise as well, particularly on the Personal Insurance side. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Great. And then my final follow-up is on the -- specifically on the accident year loss ratio. You've -- the Validus is property-centric, and it's going to be kind of fully out of the numbers next quarter. You talked about nonrenewing some property throughout the year.   And I understand Financial Lines has got a lot of pricing, but Financial Lines pricing isn't great trailing 12-month basis. So just on the underlying loss ratio, given just all the dynamics, should we be thinking about any material changes to the underlying loss ratio as the year progresses, given the moving parts? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI don't think so. I think the accident year loss ratio that we finished the year is what I would expect in 2024. Like you said, there's always a mix of business changes. There's always a little bit of noise. There could be some shift in composition. As you mentioned, property, we think we have tremendous opportunities there based on having 5 or 6 entry points across the world in terms of getting the best risk-adjusted returns.   When I look at what we've done in property over the last 5 years, we've gone from combined ratios in North America that are well north of 130 combined into the 70s and 80s now. So I think we have a really good platform. We're able to scale up businesses when we see opportunities. But I would think absent big mix of business changes, I would not expect any changes in the loss ratio.   And I signaled on the call that the remediation is largely behind us. I mean, again, you're always going to be reunderwriting, but large programs or portions of the business in commercial, we really like what we have, and I think that there's real good opportunities for growth."

So you talked about pricing assumptions for casualty, assuming loss trends of either high single digits or low teens. Did that match the loss trends embedded in the reserves? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSabra, do you want to talk about the reserves commensurate to the increase in premium and then -- sorry, an increase in rate change, particularly on excess? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. So when we've -- and we've talked about it in the past, we've taken a proactive approach to try and to react quickly to bad news that we see in trends. And as you know, even back in 2017, we moved to increase the reserves on casualty lines.   Our underlying assumptions for casualty loss trend is in the 10% range. It does vary between primary and excess. Our book historically has been a little bit more balanced towards excess, and that's why you can see some of the changes in the loss ratios accident year by accident year.   I would note that we do our deeper dive on the casualty lines largely in the third quarter. There are some that are in the second quarter, and we did complete those reserves this year without any meaningful changes in the reserves. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSo another observation, Meyer, on that is that the rates as we got to the back half of the year in Casualty, particularly in Excess Casualty, started to accelerate into double digits. And also not that this is a bellwether because there's different mix of business, but our casualty submissions in Lexington in the fourth quarter were up 100%, which just means it's getting harder to get casualty placements done in the admitted market. Pricing is going up driven by rate, terms of conditions are being tightened and there's more activity in E&S. \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess, maybe jumping off from that. I guess I'm a little surprised that there's still, if I understand correctly, the same level of proportional sessions on North American casualty despite the fact that overall profitability has gotten so much better and higher interest rates. And I was hoping you could take us through your thinking on that. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSure. Look, our casualty placements have evolved over time to reflect the portfolio, the gross limit deployment. And if I could take you back to even 2016 and '17 where we had quota shares before we arrived where we had a 50% quota share on Primary Casualty and then we had a 37.5% placement on Excess Casualty. That's just continued to evolve as we got into 2018, where we bought a large excess of loss placements for our worldwide Casualty portfolio for 75 ex of 25.   And then at the end of 2018, we bought a 50% quota share for our casualty portfolio within the United States. And the reason why I just give you that as a baseline is we've changed, evolved. We've had reinsurance in place since 2016. But when you look at what we place on the quota share today, it's basically 20%. So we've taken that down while we've improved ceding commissions over 800 basis points from the original placement to 20% from north of 50.   So I think we have been recognizing that we don't need to do as much proportional. But there's a balance in those placements between the excess and the quota share partnerships with reinsurers. They like a balance between the excess of loss and quota share in terms of our underwriting and feel very comfortable that, that's a good amount to cede off for looking at our overall casualty portfolio."

And then I believe you said parent liquidity would come on top of that. So can you just give us a sense of once you're through deconsolidation, what type of liquidity you would like to have in parent? Because I'm assuming it would be $33 billion plus the parent liquidity would be the equity that we should consider in reference to the double-digit plus ROCE target. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Elyse. I'll turn it over to Sabra in 2 seconds. But I just want to caution us that we tried to outline what we expect shareholders' equity with a variety of different variables, but it was all pro forma.   So I think Sabra can answer the question sort of technically as to how we should be looking about our capital relative to how we get to the 10% ROCE. But I just don't want to go into too many more variables because that was a pro forma that had a lot of assumptions. Sabra? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes, certainly. Look, we have a framework around our liquidity position. And clearly, given the timing of the Corebridge secondaries and the Validus sale in the fourth quarter, parent liquidity was at very attractive and high levels at year-end.   The way we think of it in a normal framework is we look at what our forward holding company needs are. So think about common dividend payments of roughly $1 billion a year. AIG-only interest expense, roughly $500 million a year. And then parent expenses, which as we've talked about, we're focused on getting those down to 1% to 1.5% of NPE range. So that's what we think about in terms of a normal liquidity position, which is lower, obviously, than where we ended the year. \n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my second question, appreciate all the color on the call on premium growth, right, I think it was around 9% in the quarter kind of ex Validus and Crop. And so as we think about the moving pieces and just your view of price, loss trend, et cetera, would you expect top line growth kind of on an adjusted basis to be within that range in '24? Are there other things that we should consider? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nWell, when you take out -- again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but like you take out Validus, Crop Risk Services, and so we have a baseline. And then when we look at our commercial portfolio -- I look at the fundamentals, Elyse, in terms of how are we growing the business. And we gave you highlights in the fourth quarter about our new business, which was simply terrific, and that momentum continues. Our retentions have been fantastic. And so again, it's a portfolio that we have done such a great job to get to a place where we really like and find opportunities for stability and more growth.   Agree on the rate. I mean, again, the fourth quarter was just a moment, but we would expect Financial Lines in 2024 not to keep up at the same pace on excess. We'll see as we get into the market, but really like the opportunities in our core businesses to drive growth.   Lexington, I know there's been a lot of discussion in this quarter around is excess and surplus lines slowing down, things going back to the admitted. There's no evidence to suggest that's true.   Again, submission count is significantly up. And it's not just property. Property, if I looked at the fourth quarter, was the lowest submission count growth, and that was up over 30%. As I said, property's around 30%, casualty was up over 100%, and health care was around 50%. So there's a lot more opportunity to continue to grow in excess and surplus lines. And you know what, the property market, you get to the second quarter and there is your opportunity.   So like we have built a reinsurance structure. We've built a gross portfolio that we can flex depending on market conditions. I mentioned Global Specialty. We think there's growth opportunities there. We think there's growth opportunities in our Personal Insurance business.   So we're cautious but optimistic that the growth rate that you outlined in the high single digits is going to be achieved. But again, we have to be in the year, and we'll give you updates every quarter, but we're optimistic."

So I was just wondering if you have any commentary on how you see the top line growth there playing out. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nMike, thanks for the question. If I look at International on the rate side, just a reminder that we do rate on gross premium written, not net. And so like as you take that from the portfolio, there's a heavy weighting our Specialty business in the fourth quarter. And the Specialty business does have a lot of quota shares and has a terrific reinsurance partnership. But it's almost 50% of the business, roughly between 40 to 50 in the quarter.   And so Specialty while had good rate increase in marine, political risk had a weighting on rate in the quarter as well as Financial Lines. Financial Line is about 20% of the gross premium written in the quarter and having a negative that just weights the overall rate environment.   But we had very strong rate in property. We had very good rate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of 8% in marine. And so yes, the overall index was at or perhaps slightly below loss cost trend, but it's not something we're concerned about.   The other thing too, in Specialty, you should realize is that December 1 is when all aviation renews. And so that was low single digits, again, weighting on it.   But it's mix of business, it's gross, and why I say gross is that when you take the gross to net for our Specialty business, it's basically 50% net premium written to gross. And so like we put that in the math in terms of our ceding commissions and profitability of the portfolio. But overall, we were pleased and think that there's opportunities to improve that in 2024. \n\nMichael Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nAnd then maybe just on the adverse PYD in Russia, Ukraine. Just is that related to aviation? And is that just accident year '22? Because I think there was some adverse in other -- '20 and '19. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSabra, do you want to provide a little bit of update in terms of how we got to the adverse? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nSure. And I'll just start by overall. As I mentioned, we did have some favorable prior year development from older catastrophe years. So those were basically in years 2018 through 2020.   If you look at the more recent accident years, as we indicated, we did put up $75 million of additional reserves related to Russia- and Ukraine-related claims. We've been evaluating our exposure for some time. And based on the analysis where we are at the end of the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase our reserves for the quarter.   But I would also note that in the 2022 accident year, we did have some adverse development on winter storm Elliott, which was at the very tail end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And then in the older accident years, as I said in General, we netted to a favorable reserve development. But we did have some adverse development in the 2018 and 2019 accident years on some mergers and acquisitions-related exposures."

As we think about that and the use of proceeds from Corebridge, are you willing to go kind of meaningfully below that? And if not, what is the other kind of potential uses of capital here that you're thinking about to mitigate dilution from selling down your remaining interest in Corebridge? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Brian. It's a good question. It's a little leading, but we had outlined the capital management strategy for the first 6 months, and that gets us below the [ 650 million ] share count at a base assumption of a stock price around where we are now. And so there's a few variables that could accelerate that or slow it down depending on market conditions and share price. But we know we have the liquidity, and we just wanted to outline what we thought we would do within the first 6 months.   The next is dependent upon when we do a secondary sell-down, which I would expect before the end of the second quarter another sell-down, which gives us more liquidity. And the primary focus is going to be on share repurchase and dividend payment and believe that we can then get by the end of the year down to the lower end of the range or the 600 million.   Once we're closer to that, we feel like we've made enormous progress on all the elements of our capital management strategy. It has been very balanced and believe we would have to give guidance after that in terms of what we intend to do. But I kind of want to get to the range first, in the 600 million to 650 million, and then get to the lower end of the range with proceeds, and then we would provide additional guidance. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. That's helpful. And then, Peter, I just want to chat briefly on the Financial Lines business. And it seems like everybody is cutting Financial Lines. I'm just kind of wondering like who is actually running the business? And do we think we're getting closer to a bottom here? And do you think that's still a significant headwind to 2024 premium growth? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Brian, for the question. And I've been trying to find a way to bring in McElroy to close it out. So Dave, why don't you give Brian some insight, and then we'll send it back to me, and we'll finish up. \n\nDavid McElroy - Vice Chair, General Insurance (AIG):\nThank you, Brian, and thank you, Peter. The -- yes, honestly, Brian, you see the weighting of the Financial Lines in our portfolio. It's a bit of an outside influence. But we've also gone through the year, and I think we trade the market we're in, not the market we hope for.   So the -- I think we've been prudent around letting excess underpriced business go. I think we've been good about holding on to our primary business. So I think that actually really has held up well.   I'd also think that it's always worth understanding there's a lot of other products in the portfolio. And they've held up well, whether that's private company business or professional indemnity or the fidelity businesses. Those are strong, and we actually anticipate those will continue to hold up in '24, okay?  The seminal event is 2023 showed up with different securities class action experience than the '20 to '22 cohort here. It actually looks more like '16 to '19. The question will be whether the industry reacts to that, okay? Much more severity flowing through that year. It obviously exposes the verticality of loss.   I do think it's put a little bit of a floor on the market going into 2024. We're seeing that. We're seeing that now. There's definitely going to be more control in primary, but I'm not going to be -- we won't sit on the front cover of CNBC -- or sitting in the middle of CNBC, but we like the business. We like the pricing of the business. And we also think that it's tethered to the economy. As that shows up, that will also help with new business opportunities that we see both in M&A, both in IPOs and both in structured. So it is the first time in 3 years that I might give it a little bit of optimism. Peter? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Dave. Thank you very much, and thanks, Brian. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the earnings call today and greatly appreciate the engagement. And I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for all they've done to progress the strategic progress that we've made and just have delivered tremendous results.

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead. \n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nGood morning, and thanks very much. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.    Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.    Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, May 3.    Finally, today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written, adjusted pretax income, underwriting income and margin in General Insurance are presented both on a reported basis as well as a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the first quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re.   With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.  Here are some highlights from the quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.77 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.5 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, reflecting improved accident year results, including lower catastrophes and increased 67% year-over-year on a comparable basis, if you exclude divested businesses from the prior year quarter.    The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and was the tenth consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio. The quarter also reflected the significant improvement we have made in controlling volatility in our property portfolio as total catastrophe-related losses in the quarter were $107 million or 1.9%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year.   Turning to Life and Retirement. The business reported very good results with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion in the first quarter, their highest quarterly result achieved in the last decade, and strong APTI growth of 12% over the prior year quarter.   Last September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. Life Insurance business to Aviva plc, which calls on April 8. Net proceeds were approximately $550 million and will be used for Corebridge share repurchases.    During the quarter, we returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases, $250 million of dividends and the redemption of all our outstanding Series A preferred stock for $500 million. We repaid $459 million of debt upon maturity, lowering our total debt to $9.8 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately $613 million of common stock in April.   Based on our strong performance, the AIG Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in AIG's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share. The AIG Board of Directors also increased the share repurchase authorization to $10 billion, effective May 1. Lastly, we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $5.1 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued strong execution of our strategy to deliver sustained underwriting excellence, profitability and disciplined capital management.\n\n During my remarks this morning, I will discuss 4 important topics:\nfirst, I will provide some financial highlights in the quarter focused on the General Insurance business, including some insight into our net premiums written; second, I will talk briefly about the results in Life and Retirement; third, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy, specifically our plans for 2024 and 2025; and finally, I will discuss our path to a 10%-plus ROCE and provide more detail on AIG Next and our future state operating structure that will create value through a leaner and more unified company.   Let me take a moment to update you on our sell-down of Corebridge. Our Corebridge holdings currently stand at 324 million common shares outstanding, which represents a 53% ownership stake. We continue to explore all alternatives to reduce our ownership stake in Corebridge. Once Corebridge is deconsolidated from AIG, Life and Retirement's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be included in AIG's consolidated financial statements, and our remaining ownership stake will be reported in parent investments with dividends reported in net investment income.   Sabra went through this in detail on our last earnings call. We have been evaluating opportunities to maximize long-term value for Corebridge and have considered multiple strategic alternatives that we believe will best position Corebridge for future success. We remain committed to reducing AIG's ownership and to fully selling our remaining stake, and I will continue to provide updates to all of our stakeholders.    In terms of the use of Corebridge-related proceeds, AIG expects to continue to utilize excess capital and liquidity, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and liability management, which I will discuss later when I outline our capital management strategy.  Now turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion and reflected the impact of the dispositions of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services as well as actions we've taken to restructure specific treaty reinsurance. Overall, Global Commercial had a very strong quarter. Excluding the impact of our divestitures, Global Commercial net premiums written growth was 1% year-over-year.  First, I want to reconfirm the guidance for the year. We expect high single-digit growth in net premiums written for the full year in our Global Commercial Insurance business. Now the results. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 4%. Lexington grew 24%, which was led by Casualty and Western World. Our Excess Casualty line grew 46% and our Captive Solutions grew 20%.    There's been meaningful commentary on the Excess & Surplus Lines market, and we continue to experience terrific fundamentals and results in Lexington. Let me provide a few examples. Our submission volume was up over 50% year-over-year. Lexington delivered strong new business, outperforming last year's record first quarter results, balanc"

Lexington delivered strong new business, outperforming last year's record first quarter results, balanced across all lines. And retention remains strong for Lexington at 78%.   Shifting to North America Retail Property, net premiums written were negative $120 million in the quarter, driven by first quarter reinsurance purchased and had over a 600 basis point impact on the first quarter net premiums written growth for North America commercial compared to prior year. North America Financial Lines declined 4% year-over-year. In prior quarters, we provided meaningful commentary on the dynamics within Financial Lines, so I will not go through that again.   It's been a challenging market environment with continued headwinds on rate. Having said that, we continue to believe our portfolio is strong, and we remain disciplined. Sabra will give more detail in her prepared remarks.   In International Commercial, net premiums written were flat for the quarter. International Property grew 23%, and Talbot grew 18%. This was offset by a decline in our Global Specialty business of slightly over 10% due to some top line weakness in energy and the effects of the reinsurance restructuring. Also, we had a 5% decline in International Financial Lines.   Now turning to the combined ratio. Our Global Commercial business in the first quarter had an outstanding result with an 84.4% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, was 86.6%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year.   This was led by International Commercial which, on a comparable basis, had an 82.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 83.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year.  North America Commercial also had an outstanding result with an 85.9% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 89.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe which is a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. These results were simply outstanding and are a testament to our commitment and culture of underwriting excellence.    Shifting now to global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written were flat to prior year. We had modest growth in Personal Auto and Individual Travel and reductions in high net worth driven largely by reinsurance and Accident & Health, largely driven by 2 nonrenewals in China, as part of our focus on portfolio improvements in our Accident & Health business.    North America Personal had a 97.7% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe. This is a 990 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 101.6% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is an 870 basis point improvement year-over-year.    As we discussed last year, we expect a material financial improvement in 2024 that will be driven by higher earned premium and a lower loss ratio from the high net worth business. We saw this manifest in the first quarter and expect this improvement to continue throughout 2024.    International parcel insurance had a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year; and a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. Overall, I'm very pleased with the financial performance of General Insurance, which delivered another excellent quarter.    Our reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. Our objective has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle.    We believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients while also delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG, especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from Corebridge. Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. This deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results.   As a result of our divestiture of Validus Re, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and created meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns. Without going through each return period by peril and region, our key zone PMLs on average, have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming.   Our reinsurance purchasing is deliberately concentrated at January 1. As a result, any changes in purchasing tend to be more pronounced in the first quarter reporting of net premiums written. In January 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses, so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus Re. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio.  It's worth noting, when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post deconsolidation and subject to market conditions.    As a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group with 1 in 11 attachment point in North America wind and 1 in 19 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure. Importantly, our net premiums written in commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio.    Our earnings potential is significant. And when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025.   Turning to Life and Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In April, Corebridge completed their Corebridge forward restructuring. $400 million of savings has been actioned or contracted, and they expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by the end of 2024 at a cost to achieve of $300 million.    Corebridge repurchased approximately $240 million of common shares during the first quarter, and they have repurchased $370 million of common shares year-to-date. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. This week, the Corebridge Board of Directors approved a share buyback authorization of $2 billion, which reflects their stated commitment to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio to shareholders, subject to market conditions.

      "raw_bytes": "to shareholders, subject to market conditions.   Turning to other operations. We have made significant progress towards our future state operating model. Adjusted pretax loss from other operations in the quarter, including Life and Retirement, was $408 million, a 17% improvement year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to lower general operating expense, higher short-term investment income and lower interest expense at AIG due to debt reduction actions. We expect our future state parent expenses to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million by year-end 2024. After deconsolidation, we intend to use 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned as a benchmark of total parent expenses in the future.    Turning to capital management. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. Over the past couple of years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet by making key decisions that have increased our financial flexibility while always planning for the long term, which has allowed us to accelerate the execution of our strategy and unlock meaningful value for AIG shareholders.    Along with establishing appropriate debt capital structures for AIG and Corebridge and diligently executing on AIG's capital management priorities, we have also completed over $40 billion of capital market transactions since 2022. We have been very disciplined in the execution of the components of our capital management strategy that we first outlined in 2022.  \n\n As a reminder, our objectives were:\nto maintain very strong insurance company capital levels to support organic growth and a steady source of operating subsidiary dividends to service parent company needs; to reduce our total debt outstanding and improve our leverage ratios, providing a well-structured and well-laddered debt portfolio with no outsized amounts due in any given year, particularly over the next 5 years; to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends; to increase our dividend as our earnings and financial flexibility improved; and to maintain a strong parent liquidity position.    All of our Tier 1 insurance company subsidiaries are at or above their target capital ranges and have the ability to support meaningful growth without additional capital contributions. At current profitability levels, we had approximately $3 billion of run rate dividend capacity from our global General Insurance subsidiaries with approximately $2 billion attributable to the U.S. General Insurance company's dividend capacity.   We have increased the U.S. General Insurance company dividend capacity by approximately 400% over the last 3 years. This reflects a significant increase from 2021, when it was $550 million; and in 2022, when it was $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we expect to continue positioning AIG with maximum capital flexibility for growth, including reviewing our reinsurance over time and considering compelling and strategic inorganic growth opportunities should they exist.    In addition to strong insurance company capitalization, we've continued to significantly reduce our overall debt. Outstanding debt is now approximately $9.8 billion, a reduction of over $12 billion since the end of 2021, which has been a remarkable result for AIG. We had previously provided guidance that we're targeting a 20% to 25% total debt-to-capital ratio, and we expect to be in the 15% to 20% range upon deconsolidation.  While we may do additional work on maturities, we would not expect that to take priority over share repurchases. Since 2022, we've increased our focus on share repurchase activities. We completed over $5 billion of repurchases in 2022 and approximately $3 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corebridge sell-downs and market conditions.  All of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sale proceeds, General Insurance dividends and market conditions.   And based on the current stock price, we would expect this to get us closer to the higher end of our target share count range of 600 million to 650 million common shares by the end of the second quarter and towards the lower end of the range by the end of 2024. Furthermore, based on this outlook and depending on the stock price and market conditions, we would expect to be between 550 million and 600 million shares outstanding by year-end 2025.    Turning to our dividend. The AIG Board of Directors recently increased the cash dividend of $0.40 per share on AIG common stock up 11%, the second consecutive year with an increase of more than 10%. I could not be more pleased with our progress. We remain confident in our ability to deliver while continuing the positive momentum in our financial performance.   We remain committed to delivering an adjusted 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. For the first quarter, we achieved a 9.3% adjusted ROCE and a 13.3% adjusted ROCE in General Insurance. Contributing to ROCE will be AIG Next, which will focus on achieving an expense base that will generate additional savings for AIG while reducing complexity throughout our organization and simplifying how we operate. AIG Next will create clarity in our operating structure, including aligning our underwriting and claims organizations with our operations and functions while defining our parent company of the future.    This is the key objective as we weave AIG together. To be a less complex, more effective and leaner company with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next has clearly defined work streams governed by a very experienced, centralized team with significant experience in transformations and company design reporting directly to me.   As I stated on previous calls, we expect AIG Next to generate approximately $500 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Of the $500 million in run rate savings, we expect $350 million to be actioned in 2024, which is an increase of the guidance we have provided in the past, and the balance will be actioned within 2025 with a cost to achieve of $500 million.    To date, we've made meaningful progress on AIG Next across multiple work streams. In April, we announced a voluntary early retirement program available to colleagues in the United States who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their retirement from AIG with enhanced retirement benefits.   The population of eligible participants represents approximately 25% of our U.S. workforce. About half of the eligible participants are located in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. We are anticipating a 50% take-up rate, which would result in approximately $225 million of onetime cost and a net run rate benefit of approximately $150 million after reinvestment for the skills and capabilities we need for the future. The numbers I have provided for our early retirement program are included in the total numbers I provided for AIG Next.    In summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance as we start 2024. As I said in my recent letter to shareholders, our ability to execute continues to be one of the company's best attributes. We have accomplished a significant amount in the past several years in order to position AIG for the future, and we have continued to deliver in the first quarter, which will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2024 and beyond.  I am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long term,"

I am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long term, benefiting all of our stakeholders as we continue to simplify and streamline our business and create the AIG of tomorrow.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's first quarter results, including General Insurance, investment income in Life and Retirement and a balance sheet update.   First quarter 2024 adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders, or AATI, was $1.2 billion, flat to last year due to the reduction in our ownership of Corebridge from 77.3% to 52.7% at the end of this quarter. General Insurance adjusted pretax income, or APTI, increased $110 million year-over-year, driven by higher underwriting and net investment income. The prior year quarter included APTI of approximately $175 million from Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. On a comparable basis, excluding the divested businesses, General Insurance APTI was up about $285 million.    As Peter noted, first quarter General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, up $94 million from the prior year quarter. On a comparable basis, underwriting income rose $239 million year-over-year.    International Commercial Lines was the primary contributor to higher underwriting profitability with $175 million increase in underwriting income. North America Commercial Lines underwriting income was down $95 million from the prior year quarter as reported but up $35 million on a comparable basis. Underwriting income includes catastrophe losses of $107 million in the quarter or 190 basis points on the loss ratio, down from $265 million or 420 basis points last year.  Prior year development this quarter was a favorable $34 million compared to a favorable $68 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's development was solely from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover which is recalculated each year based on prior year experience. For 2024, the amortization gain will be $34 million each quarter compared to $41 million a quarter last year.   Turning to underwriting ratios. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 89.8% this quarter, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and a 380 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. We provided additional data on Page 26 of the financial supplement on the impact of the divestitures on 2023 North American commercial combined ratios.   The accident year combined ratio ex catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and a 160 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. The accident year loss ratio adjusted for catastrophes was 56.6% this quarter, 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2023 as reported and 70 basis points better on a comparable basis. This improvement reflects continued earn-in of rate above loss cost trend and better underwriting and risk selection, particularly in Global Commercial lines.  The expense ratio for the quarter was 31.8%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter as reported, with a $43 million reduction in general operating expenses. On a comparable basis, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points with 10 basis points from the acquisition ratio and 80 basis points from the general operating expense ratio, reflecting continued expense discipline as general operating expenses rose only $6 million.   As Peter covered General Insurance premium growth, I will focus on Commercial Lines new business, renewal rate, loss trends and retention as well as reserves. New business production in Global Commercial remained strong. In North America, new business was almost $450 million and balanced across all lines with excellent performance from Lexington.   International Commercial new business levels were very good, with over $500 million in the quarter, led by Talbot, Property and Casualty, offset by lower new business in energy and Financial Lines. In North America Commercial, overall rate, excluding workers' compensation, increased 5% in the quarter with exposure adding 2% for overall pricing of 7%, which is above loss cost trend. Excluding workers' comp and Financial Lines, North America commercial rate was up more than 8% in the quarter, with exposure up 2% for overall pricing over 10%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend.   North America commercial rate increase reflect strengthening pricing trends in Casualty, including Lexington Casualty, which was up 11%; Lexington Healthcare up 15%; and Excess Casualty up 16%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% and exposure added 2% for an overall pricing increase of 5%, modestly ahead of the loss cost trend. Excluding Financial Lines, International rate was up 5% with overall pricing up 7%, well ahead of loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 7%; energy up 8%; and marine up 7%.   As we've discussed, Financial Lines is a notable exception to pricing trends. This was particularly the case in excess. We are taking a long-term view in Financial Lines and remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions, pricing and reserving. While rate trend has been negative the past few quarters, in aggregate, the cumulative rate level in North America Financial Lines is about 50% higher than 5 years ago.   Renewal retention has improved over the past several years and remained strong. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention using expiring premiums, excluding the impact of renewal rate and exposure changes on the ratio. Global Commercial retention increased to 89%, stable at 88% in North America and rose to 89% in International.    Turning to reserves. I wanted to provide some background on AIG's reserve review schedule for 2024 and quarterly processes. At AIG, we performed detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience. We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter.    In the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty book, including excess and primary Casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation and mass tort comprising about $20 billion of reserves or 44% of our total reserves. In the third quarter, we will review International Commercial Lines, Global Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other lines, totaling about $22 billion or 47% of reserves with the balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter.    Between DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review, or AVE, for each book. The AVE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR. Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges or significant major events.    We are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the reunderwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book. And by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American Casualty, 2016 through 2019 accident years, by over $1 billion. We also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain Excess Casualty segments to 10%. And by 2022, all Excess "

And by 2022, all Excess Casualty segments were at or above 10%.   Our AVE reviews on North American Casualty since the second quarter 2023 DVR continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter, in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today, and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility.  Turning now to investment income. AIG continues to benefit from reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans that exceeded sales and maturities, helping drive higher yields and net investment income in General Insurance and Life and Retirement. This quarter, consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year quarter and up 2% in General Insurance and 16% in Life and Retirement.    General Insurance net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re, which had a $5 billion portfolio. Adjusted for income on that portfolio in the prior year quarter, General Insurance net investment income rose about 7%, with a 9% increase in fixed maturities and loans driven by higher reinvestment rates.  This quarter, new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 5.9%, 150 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. The new money rates were about 115 basis points higher in General Insurance, and 165 basis points higher in Life and Retirement.   The annualized yield on fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls, prepayments and other onetime items, was 3.9% in General Insurance, 3 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 44 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The sequential yield comparison in General Insurance was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re. First quarter General Insurance alternative investment income was $54 million or an annualized return of 5.2% this quarter, down $41 million from the prior year quarter.    Continuing to Life and Retirement. Sales and earnings were strong this quarter. First quarter sales remained at historically high levels with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion driven by strong sales in fixed annuities and pension risk transfer.  Life and Retirement segment APTI was $991 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher base portfolio spread income due to higher reinvestment rates, higher fee income due to higher market levels and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Life and Retirement alternative investment income was negative $23 million this quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% due to private equity losses and very low income on hedge funds and real estate compared to breakeven last year. Corebridge's total contribution to AIG's AATI, including corporate expenses, declined by approximately $100 million or 20% over the prior year quarter due to the reduction in our ownership.   Turning to the balance sheet. Book value per common share was $64.66 this quarter, down 1% from year-end 2023 and up 10% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the impact of interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $77.79, up 1% from year-end 2023 and up 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the net impact of earnings, dividends and share repurchases.    Peter covered our capital management actions year-to-date. With respect to debt leverage, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, which includes $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt, was 23.6% at March 31, down 70 basis points from year-end 2023. Excluding Corebridge debt on a pro forma deconsolidated basis, AIG debt to total capital is expected to be within the new 15% to 20% debt target range that Peter provided.    To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. In 2024, AIG Next and the deconsolidation of Corebridge will drive significant progress towards achieving our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal and look forward to updating you on our progress.    With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions."

So you also talked about the capital management expectations. So I guess would -- should we be thinking about the repurchase program as kind of a base case, but should there be other opportunities you might look to do something organic? Or just was there anything kind of new in there, in that wording that we should -- that you're trying to get us to think about? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Mike. It's a very good question. We are going to stay very committed to the capital management structure we outlined, which is why I gave guidance on not only '24 but '25 in terms of share repurchases.  I think we've been consistent, and I added in when we're more comprehensive in our description in terms of capital management, that should inorganic opportunities exist, and they're compelling, which just means does it add product, does it add geography? Not scale and size, but just something that does help us strategically reposition ourselves. I wouldn't want to rule that out, but it's not a priority in the short term. And so that's really the context of what I provide in my prepared remarks. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Understood. And my follow-up is just on the overall competitive environment relative to growth. So you guys have been very open. You have lots of pricing gauges. You've talked about Financial Lines being -- continue to be a soft-ish marketplace. but you've also said that you estimate pricing above loss cost trend.   But is there -- is this a conducive environment for AIG to want to kind of grow opportunistically? Or is it more just in certain pockets? I guess just for the backdrop, some of us look at the Marsh pricing index and it feels like there's, in my words, not a lot of gap or a narrow gap between kind of pricing and loss trends, potentially. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. Thanks. It's a very good question. Let me start on growth. You can't -- one is you can't always look at broker index. Again, I don't know what Marsh index tracks, but sometimes, they don't catch fee business. They don't really catch the entire sort of market, which is the market we play in.   I do think it's conducive to grow. We don't look for top line growth to sacrifice profitability, and I think we evidenced that in this quarter and we've evidenced it over the past couple of years, that we continue to want to improve our combined ratios and look at businesses where the best risk-adjusted returns are. And so we have shaped the portfolio that way.\n\n It's hard in any one quarter to sometimes draw conclusions like you saw in terms of the gross premium written in this quarter. It's really driven by 3 lines:\nSpecialty; Financial Lines; and Casualty. The first quarter was impacted in International by energy within the Specialty class. But it's a great business, we're a world leader in that class, great underwriting capabilities and global distribution. And expect us to continue to grow that, and it's a very attractive combined ratio.   So I think there's a little bit of noise. We had some captives. We had reinsurance impact the quarter, because we switched from some pro rata to excess of loss. I don't think I need to go into too much more detail on Financial Lines. It's definitely an area where we watch very carefully. Sabra provided a lot of great context in her prepared remarks. But we're going to focus on making sure we have the highest-quality book.   I mean, our retention I think, spoke volumes this quarter in terms of the portfolio we like. I mean, with 89% in International, 88% in North America, across the board, that was tremendous, good new business. And so we definitely find opportunities.   I mean, the one area I just want to just note. Because Lexington, we talk about it every quarter because it just continues to just be exceptional. But the market dynamics have changed quite a bit. And when we look at Excess & Surplus lines, we think there's great opportunities to continue to grow. Even though there may have been some slowdown in Property, there's other lines of business, like casualty that we're seeing massive submission activity. And I just wouldn't look at the E&S market as a hard market play or a soft market play. It's just a market that's going to be here to stay in a different way. And so we're very much investing in that. I think the margins are great and the growth opportunities are significant."

Does that time frame remain intact? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThere's not a whole lot more I can offer in terms of the prepared remarks. Every sell-down has been important, but this one is particularly important just because we would likely become a seller of shares that will deconsolidate Corebridge. So we continue to focus on making certain we're looking at every option available.   And considering all of those variables, Corebridge has done a significant amount of work working with AIG and independently to position itself to be a separate public company. It's done an exceptional job. We're completed, most of our transition service agreements, which just means they're more operationally prepared to go.   And so again, subject to market conditions, I think my guidance I gave last quarter stands. We would expect to try and do something before the end of the second quarter. \n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my follow-up is on the new share count target that you provided for the end of '25, that 550 million to 600 million. I'm just trying to get a case of -- what the base case is for just Corebridge within that. Does that assume additional secondaries? If you did an exchange offer, would that be accretive to that share count target? I just want to get a sense of when you guys came up with this 550 million to 600 million, what you're assuming for Corebridge within that share count target. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Elyse. I think while we gave the guidance into 2025 is -- what I said in my prepared remarks is that by the end of the second quarter, if we exercise on the share repurchases that we've outlined, we would be at the higher end of the range of the 600 million to 650 million. And if we continue the $1.5 billion a quarter, which, yes, would contemplate doing a sell-down of Corebridge. But there's other forms of liquidity that come into AIG, but we would need to sell down to be able to do the $1.5 billion in the third and fourth quarter, but that gets us to the lower end of the range.  And then as we continue to do future sell-downs, we would get below the 600 million share count, which is why we decided to give a little bit more guidance as we get into 2025. It does not include a sell-down to 0, but it does contemplate several transactions that would take place in the next 4 quarters."

Are you trying to say that the intention is to do kind of no more than $10 billion until the end of '25? Or is that -- should we just take this as an update of what you think you can do based on what you're seeing today? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nI would take it as just an update. We would have gone past our current Board authorization with the 2025 guidance and worked very closely with the AIG Board of Directors to talk about what we expected the capital management strategy to be in the next 6 quarters. And that's really how we derive the $10 billion. But I wouldn't think about it anything more than that. \n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous):\nGot it. And then a follow-up, I guess, just thinking about the reinsurance. And obviously, you're continuing to add more, but you're saying potentially, like in the future, maybe scaling back on that a bit could be a way you could use some of your excess capital.   Could you just talk a little bit about, I guess, how we should think about how the gross underwriting, I guess, has improved at AIG over the past few years? And yes, like what would make you comfortable -- because we only see stuff on a net basis, but like what would give you comfort in retaining more net? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nWell, in terms of the portfolio, I'm comfortable today taking more net. But what we've done over this multiyear period in terms of strategically positioning the reinsurance is working very closely with our reinsurance partners, looking across multiple lines of business and multiple geographies in the placement of reinsurance. And then also making certain that we control volatility in this period of transition. That's been really important.  I want to emphasize that because we not only are looking at our accident year combined ratios, excluding catastrophe, we have kept our retentions or lowered them in a period of high uncertainty and high volatility because we don't want to have any outsized losses or surprises perhaps or an active cat season.   Also, I think we're very different than other insurance companies in terms of how we purchase reinsurance. It's not done at the business level. It is not done within just the finance function or treasury, it's done -- reports directly to me. And so I work very closely with Charlie Fry, work very closely with Sabra in terms of what our risk appetite is going to be for that particular year. And we've protected capital and had more quality earnings as a result of some of the reinsurance that we place.   A couple of examples of things that are just very good, but impacted the first quarter is switching more to excess of loss in certain segments like energy, we transitioned and proportionally signed down a little bit of the quota share. But it wasn't economic because we ended up getting a better outcome on the quota share with 200 basis points of improvement. So it's just repositioning the portfolio. Did the same thing with property cat.  And the reason I just gave the example on our earnings and sort of prepared remarks is just, on property cat, we can absolutely take more net if we decide to as we enter 2025, depending on the portfolio and depending on our appetite for volatility. We'll still have one of the lowest attachment points of any of our peers across the world.  We enhanced coverage. There's a lot more coverage in our property cat. We've enhanced our high net worth business in terms of excess of loss and more comprehensive coverage. And also -- again, and I'll stop here because I could go on for hours on this discussion, but is on casualty, we renewed or improved our overall construct across the globe based on the quality of our growth portfolio.   So to start thinking about ways in which we can do reinsurance differently will not have anything really to do with the gross portfolio because they're very much like that. It's more of where do we want volatility and where do we want to take more net? And we see opportunities as we enter 2025."

If I take comments on capital at the insurance companies with opportunities in Property post the sale of Validus, it seems like AIG could meaningfully increase underwriting leverage here, which could obviously contribute to the 10%-plus ROCE. Could you provide any additional color on how you're thinking about underwriting leverage here, and maybe some metrics you'd point us to? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nSure. I'll ask Sabra to comment on some of the leverage within the insurance company subsidiaries. We see great opportunities for us to grow within -- across the world. And you've mentioned Property and specifics. We have significantly reduced PMLs, which means we have aggregate to grow. And we have the capital to grow.   And the interesting part of AIG is that when we look at Property, we have so many different points of entry depending on the risk-adjusted returns that exist. If I start in the United States, and this is not all inclusive, but just as a few examples, we have Lexington E&S property, we have Retail Property, we have the high net worth business, and that can be done on an admitted or non-admitted basis. We have Retail Property. In International, we have Japan Property that's specific to Japan. We have Talbot. And we have Global Specialty. So there's so many different points of entry. Depending on the risk-adjusted returns, we can scale up or scale down, but believe that there's going to be great opportunities for us in the future.   Yes. I mean, the first quarter tempered on Property. But look, we're not in the cat season yet, and our industry is famous of just framing out the market at a point in time. We got a long ways to go this year in terms of where the opportunities exist, but we absolutely have the leverage to  grow if we like the risk-adjusted returns.   Sabra, do you want to comment on that? \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thank you, Peter. What I would just observe is, as we've stated in the past, and I'll reiterate today, all of our General Insurance subsidiaries or Tier 1 subsidiaries on a global basis have capital at or above our target ranges. And within the United States pool, which is the largest pool of our General Insurance capital, our risk-based capital ratios at the end of last year were around 460%, which is well higher than many of our peers.  So what I would note is that within the General Insurance companies, we're strongly capitalized to be able to support growth, obviously, protected by the reinsurance programs that we have. But I would just, as a general note, comment that premiums to surplus leverage isn't the best way to look at capital within a General Insurance company, particularly given a company like AIG, which is a leading player in Casualty and Specialty lines across the globe. \n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nThat's really helpful color. Yes, just a follow-up on Excess Casualty. I appreciate the comments. The premiums were up 46% in the quarter, and it seems like pricing is up meaningfully. It seems like AIG is taking advantage of market conditions where perhaps some others are pulling back. So I was hoping you could provide a little bit more commentary on the opportunities you're seeing there. And what makes AIG comfortable with the current environment? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThank you. We do see great opportunities in Casualty. We highlighted some of the performance in the quarter. We had to start, because of the portfolio that existed, reunderwriting the Casualty portfolio well before, I think, it was discussed really in the industry. And with that, became a new underwriting philosophy, new underwriting strategy, new terms and conditions, new attachment points, net limit, gross limits, pricing, margin. And so that's been a journey for us for years.   We mentioned the 16% in Excess Casualty in terms of rate is as strong as we've seen in the past several years. And so that we do think there's a lot of capacity pulling back. We have very comprehensive reinsurance to mitigate volatility and enable us to put out limits depending on our risk appetite. And obviously, we're cautious. We're watching the different lines of business within Casualty and their trends, but absolutely see opportunities to grow.   And when you look at our premium, don't think about it as we've grown policy count or limit, it's actually the opposite. I mean, like our client count, policy count and limits are all dramatically reduced when you compare them to 3 or 4 years ago. It's just been the effect of where we participated and how we price the business. And believe that, again, we're going to be cautious, but there are real opportunities for growth in the current market."

How do you weigh the options between doing several smaller chunks of sell-down from here versus maybe the potential for doing a sell-down of the remaining stake? And then another thing on the other side, right, we sort of think about this $500 million a month buyback. Is there the option to potentially do an ASR post sell-down? \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nI wish I could provide a little bit more detail on the first part of the question. We're looking at all alternatives, all size. I mean, so much is market-dependent. You have certain windows. And we want to make sure -- we have multiple stakeholders, I mean, within Corebridge shareholders, AIG shareholders, so sort of balancing that is really important for us.  But as I said in my answer and prepared remarks, we're ready to go. Everybody is anxious to move forward, but we're going to make sure we do it in a very methodical way to where we don't do anything that's not in the best interest of all that we've done so far and our stakeholders. So we will consider multiple options and keep everybody updated.   On the ASR, I mean, I think we've largely thought about this, and Sabra, if you want to comment to close out. We've done share repurchase in a methodical way. We always consider different ways in which we can do it. But maybe you can just comment, and then I'll close it out. \n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes, thanks. The thing you should keep in mind is that with the amount of shares that we can repurchase or can be repurchased by a company in any given month, whether it's an ASR or it's a 10b5-1 plan or open market purchases, it's constrained by the same factor, which is the average daily trading volume.   We have looked at doing ASRs. And to date, what we've preferred to do is just be consistently in the market every day through a 10b5-1 plan. But it's certainly something if we were to do a larger sale of a Corebridge stake where we wanted to redeploy that quickly and get the benefit of that into our share count, then an ASR is a tool that we can use to do that. But in terms of the volume per month, it doesn't really vary that different, whether it's an ASR or a 10b5-1. \n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO - Chairman and CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Sabra. And in closing, I just want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, teamwork, execution on all the progress we've made.

Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented, are reflected in AIG's condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to General Insurance results, including key metrics such as net premiums written, underwriting income and underwriting margin are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, and adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of General Insurance results and the go forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 29 through 31 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2024 financial results. We have transformed AIG and have done the foundational work for the next chapter, and I'm excited to take you through it today. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the second quarter. Then, our North America and International leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Our prepared remarks have a lot of detail, particularly related to our deconsolidation of Corebridge. We intend to provide ample time for Q&A. I want to start with highlights of our outstanding second quarter performance. As Quentin mentioned at the beginning of the call, all figures I will reference today will be on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services unless otherwise noted in order to provide a clear view of our underlying performance. Adjusted after tax income was $775 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, representing a 38% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth, a continuation of our very strong underwriting performance, ongoing expense discipline, volatility containment and a decrease in shares outstanding. General Insurance net premiums written grew 7%, led by Global Commercial, which grew over 8%. Underwriting income was $430 million. The underlying underwriting income, excluding catastrophes in prior year development improved $110 million or 17% year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%, a slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year. The CAT loss ratio was 5.7%, or $325 million of total catastrophe related losses. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $884 million, a 14% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of stock repurchases, and $261 million of dividends. We ended the second quarter with a total debt to total capital ratio of 18%, including AOCI and we have strong parent liquidity of $5.3 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to deliver outstanding financial performance and I'm equally pleased with the progress we're making on multiple strategic initiatives. There's several things I want to cover on this call to give you a sense of where we are now, how we got here, and what the future holds. In addition to walking through our financial results, on today's call, I plan to outline the recently announced transactions for our personal travel business and private client select, provide a quick update on [Technical Difficulty] reinsurance renewals and a market update, discuss our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy and provide an update on AIG Next. I should note that our strong financial results in the quarter were complicated by the complex accounting treatment of deconsolidation. In Sabra's prepared remarks, she will explain the impact to our capital structure, including shareholders' equity, as well as details on the GAAP accounting implications to our financial statements. Before I go further, I want to take a moment to comment on the deconsolidation of Corebridge, which marked a major milestone for both AIG and Corebridge. It's important to reflect on the four year journey, the significant accomplishments along the way and the rationale behind this pivotal decision for AIG. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we undertook a detailed analysis to explore strategic options to maximize value for AIG shareholders, including evaluating whether to separate our life and retirement business, which would eventually become Corebridge from AIG. In October of 2020, we announced our intention to separate. There were many noteworthy accomplishments along the way, and I'd like to highlight a few. In July of 2021, AIG announced that Blackstone Group would become an anchor investor in the new standalone company with its acquisition of 9.9% of Corebridge. Corebridge also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage up to $92.5 billion of assets under management over the subsequent six years. At the end of March of 2022, AIG announced a strategic partnership with BlackRock, where they would manage $150 billion of certain fixed income and privately placed assets, of which $90 billion would come from the Corebridge portfolio. In mid-September of 2022, AIG floated at 12.4% of Corebridge and the largest U.S. IPO of the year, a particularly noteworthy achievement during a time of significant market volatility. During 2023, we executed three marketed deals, reducing our overall ownership to 52% by year end. In 2023, Corebridge divested with considerable strategic and transactional support from AIG, Laya Healthcare and UK Life. These sales generated over $1.2 billion of proceeds for Corebridge investors. In May of 2024, AIG announced it would sell 122 million shares at Corebridge, representing an approximately 20% stake in the company to Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of the most respected life insurance companies in the world, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Lastly, in mid-June of this year, AIG announced it had met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. We remain committed to fully selling down a remaining ownership stake in Corebridge over time, subject to market conditions and other considerations. It's been quite a journey and we have accomplished a tremendous amount. Now let's turn to the travel business. During the quarter, we also announced the sale of "

During the quarter, we also announced the sale of our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, which is another important strategic step in positioning AIG for the future to further simplify our portfolio. The transaction includes the global Travel Guard insurance business as well as its service companies and infrastructure and excludes our travel insurance businesses in Japan and our AIG joint venture arrangement in India with the Tata Group. AIG will continue to provide corporate group travel coverage through our accident and health business. The annual net premiums written for travel are approximately $750 million, most of which are reported under North America Personal Insurance. The sale is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. And last week, we announced another significant transaction involving our high net worth business. As we've discussed in prior quarters, over the course of several years, we've been deliberately transforming our high net worth business to be better positioned for the future. We've done this through a series of strategic actions, including the most recent announcement about entering into a strategic relationship with Ryan Specialty to become our excess and surplus lines distribution partner for high and ultra-high net worth markets through our managing general underwriter, Private Client Select insurance services. We like the business and we're committed to it. We've invested over $100 million in infrastructure and digital capabilities for our high net worth business over the past several years, and we believe the business is well-positioned for the future. We're also committed to delivering solutions and growing our admitted capabilities. As we previously communicated, our plan for the portfolio has been to establish an MGU (ph) with appropriate infrastructure and core foundational capabilities, enable multiple points of distribution and eventually attract more capital resources for the MGU, all while continuing to drive exceptional value for our high net worth clients as we grow the business. AIG will provide exclusive E&S paper in all 50 states through Marbleshore Specialty Insurance Company subject to regulatory approvals. This progress reflects the momentum we've created with expanded capabilities and broader partnerships. Now turning to General Insurance results. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $9.9 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year, with 8% growth from Global Commercial and 5% growth from Global Personal. Global Commercial had an excellent quarter with strong net premiums written growth of 8%, driven by significant new business, impressive retention and continued accident year combined ratio improvement. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 10%. Lexington grew 16%, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 35%; Western World, which grew 20%; and wholesale property, which grew 12%. Retail casualty grew 11%, with 21% growth in our risk management business and we had 16% growth in excess casualty, and Captive Solutions grew 30%, driven by new business. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6%. Global Specialty grew 8%, led by 18% growth in energy, Talbot grew 12% and retail property grew 11%. In the second quarter, Global Commercial produced record new business of nearly $1.3 billion, which is an 18% increase from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $753 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of over 60% from the prior quarter. The growth was led by Lexington, which had 31% new business growth year-over-year and 75% new business growth from the first quarter, the highest new business volume of any quarter in my tenure. Lexington also achieved a significant milestone with over $1 billion of gross premiums written this quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year quarter. This is the highest gross premiums written quarter for Lexington since we repositioned the business in 2018. In other businesses, retail casualty new business grew over 40%, led by our risk management business and excess casualty. International Commercial produced new business of $522 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty, which had 17% new business growth, led by energy and marine. Casualty, which had over 30% growth, and property, which had over 10% growth. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention. International retention was 89% and North America retention was 87%. Moving on to Global Personal Insurance. Net premiums written grew 5% year-over-year. North America Personal net premiums written increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the high net worth business. International Personal net premiums written increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto and accident health new business. Shifting to the combined ratio, as I noted earlier, the second quarter General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 83.5%, a 180 basis point improvement. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 84.7%, a 250 basis point improvement. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 82.1% or a 130 basis point improvement. The Global Personal accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes was 96.8%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. North America personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes to 101.8%, a 530 basis point improvement. International personal improved its accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes by 50 basis points and 94.8%, driven by improvements in the expense ratio. Now I want to shift to provide some context around mid-year reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market. As we have previously discussed, we purchased the vast majority of our treaty reinsurance at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter. We were able to execute on all of our strategic reinsurance goals this quarter, achieving risk adjusted rate decreases and lowering or maintaining retentions across all of our major purchases. The outlook for the second half of 2024, particularly with respect to natural catastrophes is uncertain. The five leading forecasters are predicting above average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. While there was a lot of positive sentiment across the industry following modest natural CAT loss activity in the first quarter, I've learned over my career to wait until the wind and typhoon seasons are over before declaring how the year will be impacted by natural disasters. It's simply too unpredictable. When reviewing capacity in the market, it's important to analyze the available capacity from the rated market and the alternative capital market. We're all well aware of what happened with rated reinsurers in 2022. On average, they moved attachment points significantly higher to higher return periods and they restricted coverage mostly to name perils. If you were to look at the complementary alternative capital market, it has approximately $110 billion of estimated capital deployed and in many ways, more stated available capital in any individual year over the prior 10 years. However, you need to review what "

However, you need to review what makes up that $110 billion to appreciate the true availability for reinsurance. The CAT bond market and ILW market make up approximately 50% of the alternative capital market, the highest nominal amount of any time in history and those products are accompanied with basis risk and in some cases, meaningful basis risk. Additionally, the collateralized market is back to 2016 levels, which is somewhere between $45 billion to $50 billion of capital. The market is deploying 90% of the collateralized limit as occurrence reinsurance or occurrence retro, leaving less than 10% of the remaining collateralized reinsurance available for aggregate covers. Why do I outline this level of detail? Because we've remain very disciplined and maintained our aggregate cover at the same attachment point and AIG utilizes approximately 50% of the globally available ILS reinsurance aggregate CAT capacity. This purchase protects us from the potential frequency of CAT and allows us to prudently manage volatility. And again, based on my experience, once insurers give up lower occurrence or aggregate attachment points, you simply do not get them back. Further, analyzing industry data from over 150 companies published by AAON between 2013 and 2024, average attachment points went up on an inflation adjusted nominal basis everywhere in the world, in some cases significantly during that period. For example, in Asia, average attachment points increased over 270%, EMEA and the UK over 250%, and in the U.S. over 280%. AIG has structured its treaties to have lower attachment points with less volatility. When examining occurrence attachment points across the world from 2022 to 2024, which is another very good measurement, AIG has maintained or reduced its attaching points, making it the lowest amongst our peer group. For the balance of 2024, we have approximately $95 million remaining on our international aggregate cover, excluding Japan and $270 million on our North America aggregate cover, excluding wind and quake. This is well within our established risk appetite and believe we remain well protected against both the frequency and severity of CAT events. Reinsurance premiums are well embedded in our original pricing and our portfolio for properties performing exceptionally well. Now I will provide a high level summary of our capital management strategy and the milestones we've accomplished. We've made enormous progress executing against our capital management goals in a disciplined manner with a focus on positioning AIG for the future and driving value for our shareholders. We have deployed over $30 billion in cash towards that capital management strategy over the last three years, which has provided AIG with maximum flexibility. To provide context on the magnitude of what we accomplished, there are some key highlights. In 2021, AIG had greater than 850 million shares outstanding and approximately $25 billion of outstanding debt and preferred stock. Using current liquidity and proceeds generated from divestitures and earnings, over the past three years, we repurchased over $13.5 billion of shares, reducing our overall share count by over 200 million shares or approximately 25%. As of June 30, 2024, we have less than 650 million shares outstanding. We expect to further reduce this in the second half of 2024 and in 2025, depending on the timing of the closing of the Nippon Life transaction, subject to regulatory approvals, as well as additional future sell downs of our remaining Corebridge shares subject to market conditions. By the end of 2025, we expect our share count to be in the 550 million to 600 million target range, consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter, representing a total of $10 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions. Since 2021, we paid approximately $3 billion of shareholder dividends. We increased the dividend by more than 10% in each of the last two consecutive years. Additionally, we reduced AIG's debt outstanding from $25 billion to $9.8 billion and have achieved our target debt to capital leverage ratio range of 15% to 20% with a second quarter leverage of 18% versus 27% three years ago. Our insurance company subsidiaries are in a very strong capital position with capital ratios above target ranges, which will enable us to continue to grow profitably without having to contribute additional capital. We ended the second quarter with $5.3 billion of parent liquidity and we continue to explore compelling and strategic inorganic opportunities that are complementary to our current business. As part of positioning AIG for the future, over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify AIG. We're weaving the company together to operate seamlessly as one cohesive organization across underwriting, claims and all of our functional areas with the skills and capabilities to compete in the future. As a company, we've completed multiple transformation programs. These efforts, including AIG 200 have resulted in a reduction of our expense base of approximately $1.5 billion since 2018, while investing for the future. For example, over the last two years, we've invested approximately $300 million in data, digital workflow, AI and talent to accelerate our progress. If you look over the past five years, it include technology, end-to-end process workflow and foundational data investments that were part of AIG 200, our investment has been over $1 billion. Also at the beginning of 2024, we formally launched AIG Next to further accelerate the realization of additional operational efficiencies. As part of the AIG Next program, we're redefining our existing retained parent costs to reflect only expenses related to being a global regulated public company such as costs related to corporate governance, enterprise risk management and audit. Our objective is to decrease retained parent cost to $325 million to $350 million, or 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned going forward. Expenses not defined as parent company costs will be fully embedded within the General Insurance results or they'll be redundant. All of the factors being equal, we would expect our full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio to be the same or lower than the full year 2023 metric on a comparable basis as a result of the actions were taken as part of AIG Next. We originally provided guidance that we would reach the combined ratio as the exit run rate at the end of 2025, and we now believe we can achieve it in the 2025 calendar year. Additionally, while I've not spoken in detail about AI in the past, we've been making substantial progress and I want to provide a high level overview. AIG is advancing its data and digital strategy using artificial intelligence, large language models and data ingestion applications with the objective of increasing underwriting efficiency and augmenting execution capabilities. We've spent considerable time over the past 12 months to 18 months creating a blueprint for the future that we use each of these components together, where each one is integral and connected and we redesign and refine the end-to-end underwriting workflow processes. Our primary objective is to construct an AI powered underwriting portfolio optimization capability that provides faster, more thorough, deeper analysis and improved customer service in quoting, binding and policy issuance by enabling increased underwriting productivity through the automation of manual processes. This will drive more accurate informed decisions by leveraging better data through foundational sources such as broker and agent submissions, and supplemented with validated sources of additional third-party data. We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling "

We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling and amplify compute capabilities, underpinning this work is a robust governance framework designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving global AI regulatory landscape. I will discuss two areas of focus, underwriting efficiency and underwriting management. With underwriting efficiency, we're developing a mechanism using large language models by which submissions are automatically filtered through real-time underwriting guidelines, allowing underwriters more capacity and the ability to assess many more submissions that meet our defined underwriting criteria, objectives and risk appetite. In underwriting management, we're dynamically managing the review of submission data with a disciplined application of underwriting guidelines and portfolio objectives, allowing underwriting leadership to more deeply and accurately analyze market conditions and enabling dynamic adjustments to underwriting guidelines, pricing and limit deployment. As we build our agentic ecosystem, we're using a multi-vendor technology strategy with multiple partners that is designed to evolve over-time. Our platform has been built for flexibility, configurability and adaptability to accommodate current and future technology. This includes the ability to support the expansion of generative AI capabilities for scalability globally across our platform, while keeping the underwriter at the center of decision making. This is just a glimpse into the significant work we've been doing to use generative AI and large language models as part of our overall data and digital strategy. We'll continue to advance these efforts over the remainder of this year and as we enter 2025. In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and what we've accomplished not only during the quarter, but over the past several years to prepare AIG for a bright future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's exceptional second quarter financial results with a particular focus on the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation, General Insurance quarterly financial results, written premium rate trends, other operations, book value per share and ROE. I will begin with Corebridge related activity this quarter and the accounting treatment on AIG's financials. A few key dates to outline. On May 16, we announced the agreement with Nippon Life. Because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%, held for sale accounting and the classification of Corebridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corebridge on May 30, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting, because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board. On June 9, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corebridge Board triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro-forma financials with the SEC four days later. Discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on Slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period with assets and liabilities each classified in one-line for both sides of the balance sheet. However, since Corebridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period, but also for past periods. As a result, we reclass Corebridge's assets, liabilities and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for the second quarter and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on Slide 15. While AIG total assets of $544 billion as of March 31, 2024 is the same as originally reported and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items. For example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported, decreased $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation, with $236 billion of Corebridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations. The next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on June 9. On the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this principle. Today, I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers. Turning to Slide 16, the first step is the fair valuing of Corebridge's assets and liabilities as of June 9. The net fair value amount was $9.7 billion comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corebridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets and previously consolidated investment entities. Next, we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This resulted in net gain on sale of Corebridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after tax. After that, accounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's balance sheet, which is unrealized losses on Corebridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on Slide 17. To determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corebridge's net income for the quarter prior to June 9, which was $325 million after tax to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter. Now, I'll cover the impact on AIG's shareholders' equity, turning to Slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG's shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at March 31, including Corebridge on a consolidated basis. Excluding deconsolidation impacts, the second quarter change in AIG shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation. Then, you layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after tax gain on sale for total AIG shareholders' equity of $44.4 billion at June 30, 2024 or a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at June 30, a 6% increase from March 31. Please note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corebridge equity owned by other shareholders is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is o"

The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on Slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corebridge at March 31, 2024 was $19.2 billion and total equity was $49.1 billion for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%. With deconsolidation, Corebridge's debt of $9.4 billion and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in June 30 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15% to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation in the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation this quarter. I will now cover second quarter General Insurance and other operations results. Turning to General Insurance, adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, up 7% on a comparable basis due to strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. General Insurance net investment income was $746 million, up 10% on a comparable basis due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. Considering current interest rates and $1.6 billion of General Insurance dividends paid to parent at quarter-end, we expect third quarter General Insurance investment income from fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of about $700 million. Income on alternatives and other investment assets were $33 million and $52 million respectively in the quarter, up $32 million in total from $44 million and $9 million respectively in second quarter 2023. Second quarter 2024 underwriting income on a comparable basis was $430 million versus $420 million in second quarter last year, driven by lower expenses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Year-to-date, underwriting results have been strong with an accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes of 56.3%, mainly driven by changes in business mix compared to the prior year. Based on earned premium roll-forward and barring unforeseen significant changes in loss trends, we expect the accident year loss ratio ex-catastrophes will remain strong in the second half of 2024 at approximately the same level as the first half. Turning to natural catastrophes. The industry globally had another quarter of elevated losses with approximately 100 events. For AIG, second quarter catastrophe losses totaled $325 million or 5.7 points on the loss ratio, principally from secondary apparels, including severe convective storms in the United States, floods in the Middle East and Brazil, and hail in Japan with a roughly 50-50 split between North America and International. Our largest loss in the quarter totaled $90 million from exceptionally heavy rains in the UAE. Considering the forecast for hurricane season this year and secondary peril losses year-to-date, we believe that using AIG's last year total catastrophe losses is a good proxy for full year 2024. While actual losses will depend on the size and strength of events, our underwriting standards, limits and reinsurance programs, both occurrence and aggregate will help reduce the net impact of catastrophe frequency and severity on AIG's balance sheet. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the third quarter is usually by far the highest catastrophe quarter with losses averaging 40% to 50% of the total for the year. Turning to reserves, prior year development, net of reinsurance was a favorable $79 million, reflecting the net result from DVRs completed on more than $20 billion of reserves, about 45% of the total in the quarter. Overall, the DVRs, which included U.S. casualty, resulted in net favorable development on workers' compensation and modest net unfavorable development of $30 million on excess casualty, including $66 million for accident year 2021. The 2021 excess casualty reserve charges were for a few large known losses and commercial auto loss trends, reflecting the rebound in auto frequency and severity after the pandemic lockdown in 2020 when frequency was very low. We have not seen this increase in frequency and severity trends in the more recent accident years. Within the casualty and excess casualty books overall, severity trends remain generally consistent with our assumptions. While we see some favorable trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years, we will continue to allow time for these years to mature. Pricing, which includes rate and exposure for Global Commercial Lines this quarter increased 5%, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, while our view on loss cost trends have remained stable. In North America Commercial, renewal rates increased 2% in the second quarter or 4% if you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines and the exposure increase was 2%. In International Commercial, overall rate was largely flat or a 1% increase excluding financial lines and the exposure increase was 3% excluding financial lines. We continue to monitor our portfolio very closely and while rate in the second quarter is below trends on certain lines of business, such as property, it is above trend in others. To give more insight on property, North America retail and wholesale property saw rate increases drop below trend in the second quarter, but that's on the back of rate increases in excess of 25% in 2023 and cumulatively in excess of 150% since 2018. International property is about 100% higher. In 2023, our property portfolio had an excellent combined ratio. In North America casualty lines, in particular excess casualty, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend. We continue to focus on writing business that has attractive returns and while the price adequacy of our portfolio, of course, varies by line, it remains strong overall and within our expectations. Turning to other operations, deconsolidation vastly simplified the income statement. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $158 million, a 43% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to $68 million in Corebridge dividends and higher short-term investment income. Finally, with deconsolidation, we expect our 2024 adjusted tax rate to be about 24% before discrete items in line with our second quarter. With the deconsolidation of Corebridge this quarter, AIG's income statement and balance sheet are simpler and we no longer have the volatility of life insurance and annuity accounting. With all the changes, we took the opportunity to evaluate our non-GAAP equity metrics, which were established more than a decade ago when AIG was a vastly more complicated conglomerate. The principal change was revising our calculation of adjusted book value to only adjust for investment related accumulated other comprehensive income, which is not within management's control and which will revert to par as bonds approach maturity. Adjusted book value per share was $72.78 per share at June 30, 2024. In addition, we added a core operating shareholders' equity metric, which reflects the equity invested in AIG's go-forward business. It is calculated by subtracting from adjusted book value, the market value of Corebridge stock and GAAP deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. Both of these assets have significant value to our shareholders, but contribute little to AATI. We believe this metric is more useful for valuing AIG's global general insurance business and also for measuring our progress towards a 10% plus ROE target. Over time, as we reduce our ownership in Corebridge to zero and monetize the DTA through earnings, core operating book value will become the same as adjusted book value. Core operating book value per share was $53.35 per share at June 30, 2024. To wrap-up, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments in 2024.

      "raw_bytes": "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nHey, great. Good morning. First question on the updated kind of combined ratio trajectory guidance for '25. So loud and clear that you'll be able to kind of hit it a bit sooner. I'm curious if you can kind of, if we focus on the loss ratio, what the guidance implies on a like-for-like basis on the loss ratio? Some of the questions we get continuously around most companies seeing some slippage in their loss ratios given lower levels of reserve releases. I'm curious if that's something that's considered within your loss ratio guidance.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Mike, for the question. The guidance that we've given in terms of what we expect for the full year 2025 does not contemplate any improvement in loss ratio. It's all in the expense ratio. And so we're trying to guide everybody is that all the expenses that exist in other operations will transition into parent, they'll go into the business or they'll be eliminated and that we're not going to be increasing our combined ratios based on the guidance that we gave at the end of '23. So we're not anticipating any caveats on loss ratios to be able to meet that guidance.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nAnd I guess just I'll stick on this for my follow-up. So given pricing is below loss trend in certain lines like property and understanding that the absolute, maybe this is the answer to the absolute pricing levels are still accretive to the -- to ROE or loss ratio just does it. To the extent, the current pricing environment held, why does it kind of make sense that the loss ratio should be able to kind of stay flattish, and not trying to be negative, just trying to nitpick on the margin?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nNo. It's a great question. Let's take North America, for example, because you pointed out property. This quarter in terms of the overall index and rate increases, property was the headwind in that index. In casualty, we achieved mid-single digit to high-single digit rate with like 12% and excess casualty plus 2% in exposure. In Lexington, it was 11% increase in casualty, 12% in health care. So again, above loss cost trends. Property was flat this quarter. But you have to look at what's happened with the property market over the past several years. And if you look at the -- even last year in -- like excess and surplus lines, it was a 34% increase and the retail, it was 30%, that's after four years of double-digit rate increase. So I think -- look, with the low activity in CAT maybe in the first quarter, the cumulative rate increases over time, I mean, the property combined ratio fully loaded with CAT, even with giving a little bit back in the second quarter has an outstanding combined ratio. And if I can get that combined ratio for the rest of my career, I'll take it. I mean, like I don't think there's any deterioration in terms of what our overall index will be. And again, I can't really predict, that's why I kind of went into a little bit more detail about like sort of the CAT market is that we don't know. I mean, like, so property is highly driven by what happens in CAT and underlying inflation. And so I'm not going to predict what happens sort of six quarters from now, but I think we feel really comfortable with the portfolio and its profitability.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

First question, just I was hoping we can get a general sense of the impact of the sale of the travel insurance on underwriting results in North America Personal\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nHey, Meyer. Good morning. In terms of -- I outlined in my prepared remarks, the premium impact, which is the $750 million on net premiums written. But on the overall combined ratio, it's going to be de minimis in terms of what we would lose within General Insurance once we pro forma it out.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Perfect. Second question, I guess, on the excess casualty, if I understood Sabra's comments correctly, you had favorable development even on that line outside of 2021, which was a weird year. And I was hoping you could sort of break that down for us. I assume that that's older years rather than recent years, but I wanted to confirm that.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYeah. I'll hand it over to Sabra. But as you know, and she gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks, and we reviewed 45% of our total book in the second quarter. And in casualty, just based on what's going on in the global market, we really drilled down on every line of business and every year and went through it in tremendous detail. So Sabra, maybe you can just give a few highlights in terms of that analysis.\n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYeah. Sure. And just for everyone's benefit, I'll just start by framing a little bit what we did in the quarter for the DVRs. So this quarter, we evaluated $20.2 billion of reserves for U.S. casualty. That's comprised of 23 separate DVRs and more than 200 different lines of business, and then that aggregates to the five lines that you see on the 10-Q. So the net changes in the quarter were only about $20 million after written premiums, and that was $80 million favorable in workers' comp after the ADC, which has about $8 billion of reserves. It was $22 million unfavorable in excess casualty, which also has about $5 billion of reserves. And then in casualty, it's also about $5 billion reserve for $17 million favorable. In terms of the 2021 accident year, as we've noted on previous calls, we've increased our loss cost trends for 2020 and subsequent years. The adjustments we made in 2021 are from just a combination of known early reported claims that due to their facts and circumstances, we expect to penetrate the excess attachment level, including a rebound in the auto frequency and severity. In 2022 and 2023 accident years, we just have not had that same level of early claims experience, and therefore, we still have a high level of IBNR in the reserves. With respect to the accident year within excess casualty, I would note that while we did have the $66 million of adverse development in accident year 2021, we had $33 million of favorable development excess casualty from accident years prior to 2016, and that's where the delta comes it nets down to closer to the $22 million amount.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nYes. Got it. That's exactly what you needed. Thank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Meyer. Next question, please."

Since you said comparable basis, I'm assuming you mean ex-Crop and Validus. Can you guys just disclose what that figure is, just so we know what you're setting the '25 baseline out? What was the 2023 adjusted figure?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\n91.6%.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. Thank you. And then my second question is, you also mentioned in your prepared remarks, you said something about exploring inorganic opportunities. Can you just expand what that means? You guys have obviously taken action of divesting of certain businesses. So what would you look at on the expansion side and what criteria would any potential inorganic deals need to meet?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Elyse. I included that in my prepared remarks, just based on the amount of financial flexibility, strategic flexibility that we've created for ourselves. The divestitures have been really about not having like really the businesses that we divest were terrific, and they fit very well with their new owners. But some of them needed scale, like travel and crop. And we wanted to be a little bit less in the volatility business, and therefore, Validus Re was divested. I would think as we look to the future, again, we're going to be very selective, very disciplined. But there are opportunities perhaps where we have existing businesses where we feel as though, we have competitive advantages that having more scale would be helpful. There could be complementary geographies as we look to different parts of internationally, but terrific international business. But there could be places where we want to expand further that give us not only better capabilities within that geography, but also could be very good for our multinational network. There are opportunities to invest further in businesses that we have. Think about AIG TATA in India is a fast-growing large scale business that is an industry leader. And so there's opportunities there as well. So we will use the same criteria, which is to make sure it's disciplined, it's additive, its strategic and it actually furthers and accelerates the progress we can make on an organic basis. And so we will -- again, we'll keep giving updates as there's more relevant information to share.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

Can you help us think a little bit more about what goes into that and where that shakes out on a comparable basis versus the -- I think, over 100 basis points of improvement AIG has reported here in the first half?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSure. Thank you, Rob. It's really driven by mix of business. And if you take a look at this year compared to last year on a net premium earned basis, like the commercial and personal insurance businesses are literally identical in terms of its overall contribution to total premium. And then the commercial loss ratio largely stayed flat like a 10 basis point improvement, but largely flat. What happened was the Personal Insurance loss ratio dramatically improved, driven by North America which was well over 400 basis points. And so I think that that's really driving the first six months. And if we look at the back half, I mean, should we see the same thing? I think so. But you've seen all the tremendous new business, the momentum we have. The mix of business could be changed a little bit year-over-year when we look at the back half of the year, but that's really what's driving the improved loss ratio in the first six months. So it's really a true mix of business and also the significant improvement that North America personal is making and we expect them to continue to make.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay. Got it. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up. The move to kind of put some more capital to work in high net worth, is that driven by a change in sort of the view in underwriting opportunities there or have they always been good for AIG and what kind of drove that decision to double down now?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThe high net worth business had the same issues that the commercial business did, which it had too much TIV and it gets more pronounced in the high net worth business, because it's more dense. And so we needed to shed aggregate for a lot of reasons. One is that we had too much exposure in certain geographies like the world changed with COVID, the pandemic and all the macro factors that affected it. And then also the evolution of more capabilities in the non-admitted market. And so what we decided, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years, is that build out an admitted platform that is going to be very strong, the right infrastructure and have the ability to grow, but also complement that with the non-admitted market and be able to do that where you have flexibility and form rate and limits and how you can actually respond to client needs. And there's a need. And so what we've been working on is what's the best way to do that, partnering with Ryan Specialty. It's a highly fragmented wholesale market. So nobody has a real strong expertise in high net worth unless you start to build it. And I think Ryan has been doing that. And so getting access to the 40,000 independent agents with a product that's going to be saleable, and we have done such a terrific job in terms of creating opportunity for more aggregate that we want to be able to have both options. And we believe that we'll be able to grow the non-admitted property market just based on the partnership that we just announced recently. So it's always been in the plan, but we didn't want to go out and just say, we're going to do non-admitted and have it a fragmented not strategic approach. And so we believe this is going to give us great opportunities to access the market in a different way.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

And should we think about AIG as potentially being able to grow faster than the market, all equal, just by turning some of the spigots back on?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYeah. It's a terrific question, and I happen to have Don Bailey and Jon Hancock here with me. So I'm going to ask them both to comment on North America and international. It's a great question. Don, why don't you start with, how we have actually been very focused on not only retention, but new business in North America.\n\nDon Bailey - Chief Executive Officer, North America General Insurance (AIG):\nYeah. Thanks, Peter. And we have definitely pivoted to that growth mindset. Its first important to mention that we were doing this off of transforming the business over the last few years. So we come into the growth with a position of strength regarding underwriting discipline, profitability. You've heard about all that. Regarding the growth, we've been very deliberate and creating more value for our distribution partners and clients than ever before, and we're applying much more rigor in pursuing like targeted risks. All of that is what you start to see showing up in the numbers now. And I can give you a little bit more color. The retention that we're delivering high levels of retention across all of our business. I would also add that we're executing on specific market opportunities, notably retail casualty and Lexington. On the retail casualty side, we are on offense. The discipline in the excess market is a positive for us right now, and we're moving on that. Regarding Lex, the growth there comes from three places. We have strong -- continued strong retention there, new products and new customers. So it's not from bigger limits. I would describe it as healthy, horizontal growth. Regarding the sustainability of it, which I think is important, I can look at some of our Lex submission data and share that with you. Year-to-date submissions at Lex are up 42%, and that's on top of 39% growth through last year through six months. We view this as a clear flight to quality in that space. I should also add that we resourced all of that in advance. So we're well positioned to take advantage of what's coming. And Peter, I'll just say this in closing on my end, we're getting all that growth while achieving outstanding loss ratios in the core business.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nDon, thank you. That was great. Jon, maybe a little bit of context on International.\n\nJon Hancock - Chief Executive Officer, International General Insurance (AIG):\nYeah. I mean, I won't repeat what you've already said, Peter or Don, but I would say, this is still a very good market for us to underwrite in. We've got a really large diverse portfolio across international, gives us access to a huge amount of opportunity, different segments, different geographies, different points in time. So we can reshape and shift the book depending on what we see in each market. Similar themes to Don, this has been very planful. This is not opportunistic growth here. We've been building to this for a long time of a very, very high quality book of business. We start with retaining 89% of what we've worked really hard to build a really strong book. New business submissions are up as well. We're retaining that our own flight to quality as well as the market. Hopefully, we've done the markets flight to quality. A couple of highlights for me. We've got a world-class global specialty business. It's grown 8% in the quarter. And that's driven by some very, very good new business in all of the global specialty segments, especially in marine and energy, where we are recognized world leaders in both. We've grown new business in marine 15% over Q1 last year, especially strong in cargo in the UK and across Europe. Peter, you already referenced the energy, 13% increase in new business year-over-year. And that's in all of our global hubs and all of our products actually. So really, really strong targeted growth with one of our best performing profitability businesses. And I'll just finish on, I'll add in Talbot as well Talbot at Lloyd's another very, very good quarter of growth of 12%. And again, that's driven by targeted growth in specialty lines of marine liability that we grew at 13%, cargo and specie at 16% and upstream energy at 19%. And both of those with the market we've got the pipeline that we've got, we expect to see continued good growth.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThat's great, Jon. Thanks to you and Don for that detail, really helpful. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I do want to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment, teamwork and all of their execution. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Tom Bolt, who's retiring at the end of the year for his many significant contributions to AIG during a very important time and congratulate him on his story career. Tom was instrumental in establishing a global framework for AIG's underwriting standards, governance and structures and alignment with our refined risk appetite and has just been a terrific executive at AIG. So again, thank you for joining us today. Everybody, have a great day."

Now at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to General Insurance results, including key metrics such as net premiums written, underwriting income, margin and net investment income are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparisons on a constant dollar basis as applicable and adjusted to the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of General Insurance results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 26 through 28 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter. Then our North America and international leaders, Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the devastating impact the recent weather events had on our communities, which underscores the difficult reality of changing weather patterns and the frequency and severity of these events. At AIG, our claims teams have been working hard to ensure that we respond quickly. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their commitment to our clients and distribution partners. This is our purpose and it's when our company is needed most. Now let me move to the highlights of our outstanding third quarter performance. We continue to deliver exceptional underwriting results, maintain rigorous expense discipline, execute on our capital management plan and make excellent progress on our strategic priorities. Adjusted after-tax income was $798 million or $1.23 per diluted share, representing a 31% increase in earnings per share year-over-year, driven by strong core earnings growth and disciplined execution of our capital management strategy. Underwriting income for the quarter was $437 million, which included total catastrophe related charges of $417 million. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.6%. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $897 million, a 19% increase year-over-year. Other operations, adjusted pre-tax loss was $143 million, an improvement of $135 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Core operating ROE was 9.2% with core operating equity of $34.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. In the third quarter, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion of stock repurchases and $254 million of dividends. In addition, we repurchased $520 million of common stock in October. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 17.9%, including AOCI and parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. During my remarks this morning, I will provide information on the following five topics. First, I will review the financial results for our General Insurance business. Second, I will provide observations on the catastrophe market and specifically AIG year-to-date. Third, I will update you on our progress with AIG Next and its impact on other operations. Fourth, I will provide an update on our significant progress in AI and related objectives moving forward. And finally, I'll give more detail on our capital management plan and the path to achieving 10% core ROE. Turning to General Insurance. We had another excellent quarter with strong profitability and growth across our businesses. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.4 billion, a 6% increase. Net premiums earned for the quarter were $5.9 billion, a 7% increase with $4.2 billion coming from Global Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $153 million, a benefit of 2.6 points to the loss ratio. Sabra will provide more detail in her prepared remarks. In Global Commercial, we had 7% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, driven by over $1.1 billion of new business, which grew 9% year-over-year. Retention remained at 88%, which is an outstanding outcome. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 84.2% and the calendar year combined ratio was 89.9%. The GOE ratio was flat year-over-year, while absorbing over $50 million of expenses that shifted from other operations. In Global Personal, we had 3% net premiums written growth over the prior year quarter, led by 9% new business growth across our Global portfolio. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 97.8% and the calendar year combined ratio was 98.8%, both were improvements year-over-year, and we expect this segment to continue to improve its financial performance in 2025. North America Commercial grew net premiums written by 11% year-over-year. We had a closeout transaction in the quarter in our casualty portfolio that benefited overall growth, but negatively impacted the accident year loss ratio. Absent this transaction, our net premiums written growth would have been in the high-single-digits. The businesses that drove growth were casualty at 9%, excluding the closeout transaction, 8% in Glatfelter and 7% in Lexington. Retention in North America was 90% in admitted lines and 78% in Lexington, which is an exceptional outcome for an excess and surplus lines business. New business growth in the quarter was simply outstanding. On a year-over-year basis, we had 22% growth in new business led by Lexington with 24% growth. And the story for Lexington just keeps ongoing. We had over 95,000 new business submissions in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Casualty submissions were up over 70%, Western World was up over 30% and property was up over 20%. Also, our financial lines new business was up double-digits. This was due almost exclusively to a rebound in M&A following a slow new business quarter for financial lines in the same period last year. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.1% and the calendar year combined ratio was 95.5%, an exceptional outcome given the significant CAT activity in the quarter. The accident year loss ratio was 61.8% for the quarter, which was an increase of 250 basis points year-over-year and reflected two main variables.

First, the closeout transaction in AIGRM that I mentioned earlier, while profitable and incrementally beneficial to the overall combined ratio, it carried a higher loss ratio, which resulted in a 70-basis point headwind. And second, the actual versus expected in the prior year quarter comparison was very favorable as a result of our admitted and wholesale property portfolios experiencing close to 30% rate increases last year that earned in over 2023 and the early part of 2024, creating a 180-basis point headwind. The combined ratio also benefited from a lower expense ratio, reflecting improvement in the GOE ratio. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 3% year-over-year. Commercial property grew 6% as did Global Specialty, where international specialty grew 10% driven by Energy. Our Talbot business at Lloyd's also grew 6%, driven by 18% growth in the specialty lines, specifically political risk, energy and marine. International retention remained strong at 89%, which was very balanced across the portfolio, led by energy and property, both at 92% and casualty at 91%. International also had very good new business of over $500 million, led by global specialty with 25% new business growth in marine and 40% new business growth in Talbot year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 83.4%, another excellent result. The calendar year combined ratio was 84.3%. Given that the third quarter is usually the most active quarter for natural catastrophes, I want to provide some thoughts on the activity year-to-date and how the evolution of our underwriting and reinsurance strategy has significantly enhanced AIG's performance over time, even in light of this historical increased activity. For the first nine months of the year, preliminary industry estimates of insured losses from natural catastrophes are in excess of $100 billion, which appears to be the new normal. When considering the impact of Hurricane Milton on the industry and the remainder of the fourth quarter, Aon recently published a report that estimated that the 2024 total insured losses for the industry from natural catastrophes will likely exceed $125 billion. When analyzing large single catastrophes, the complexity of determining the initial and ultimate loss is complicated. Modeling firms produce industry loss estimates post event and there are many factors that go into estimating the ultimate losses. It is important to note that no two catastrophes are the same. Property claim services or PCS is a widely used source for independent property loss estimates in the United States. The loss figures that they provide are derived from claims activity and other factors at the time of loss rather than a judgment of the ultimate size of the loss. As a result, the actual scale of total loss is often subject to misinterpretation. Historically, if you look back at major events including Katrina, Superstorm Sandy and Ian, the final report of PCS figures were substantially higher than their original estimates, illustrating the uncertainty around determining ultimates or best estimates for catastrophe losses. At AIG, we've mitigated the impact that weather events have had on our business as reflected in our improved financial performance even as the world has seen more CAT activity. Over the last five years, our losses have dropped dramatically, both in nominal terms and also in terms of the overall market share of the losses. This is a testament to the work we've undertaken to change and evolve our underwriting strategy, reduce volatility and increase the quality of our earnings. If we use 2012 as a reference point, which was a year with meaningful activity, the total insured catastrophe losses on a nominal basis were $65 billion for the industry. That is roughly equivalent to the 20-year average and serves as a useful benchmark. Since 2012, expectations for annual industry catastrophe losses have grown substantially. The average annual industry loss from natural catastrophes from 2017 through 2023 has increased approximately 90% when compared to the average from 2000 to 2016. Since 2017, seven of the last eight years, including the 2024 forecast have had over $100 billion of annual insured losses. It's important to note, against this heightened level of natural catastrophe losses, based on published reports, we estimate approximately 50% of the insured natural catastrophe losses were absorbed in the reinsurance market from 2017 to 2022. However, following the major market reset in 2023, approximately 90% of the losses were retained by the primary insurance companies. And this is a significant change. As I have discussed several times, the work we've done to change AIG's approach to underwriting and reinsurance has resulted in dramatic improvements in our financial performance and balance sheet. Let me give you some specific points to contextualize the magnitude of this impact. Based on AIG's legacy underwriting strategy and reinsurance choices in 2012, AIG posted an initial pre-tax loss of $2 billion from Superstorm Sandy, which represented almost 7% of the estimated $30 billion market loss for that single event. And for the full year 2012, AIG recognized approximately $2.7 billion of losses or approximately 4% of the market losses. Today, AIG is forecasted to be within our catastrophe loss expectations for the full-year or more importantly, less than 1% market share of the forecasted total industry loss for 2024 of over $125 billion. Additionally, it's worth noting that our property portfolio net premiums written are approximately the same amount in 2024 as they were in 2012. However, today, we have 80% lower CAT losses and volatility. And importantly, our year-to-date 2024 commercial property combined ratio is in the low 80s compared to a combined ratio of nearly 120% in 2012. We've completely transformed our business over the past five years, and this is the new AIG. AIG's strategy to manage volatility through our gross underwriting actions and our approach to reinsurance, including our decision to maintain the lowest net retention amongst our Global competitors, has delivered significant benefits for the company and positions us well for the future in an environment with significantly elevated insured loss activity and modeling uncertainty. Let me take a minute to comment on high level expectations for the upcoming January 1 renewal season for property. The significant reset in the property CAT reinsurance market in 2023 means that reinsurers generally have higher attachment points, provide name perils and have significant retro protection and therefore are likely to make an underwriting profit on their global catastrophe portfolios in 2024, given the current loss levels and the benefit of reinstatement premiums. With this expectation of underwriting profit, the overall reinsurance market should remain healthy. Despite the strong capital position of the market, generally speaking, I would expect the market to remain disciplined at January 1, not reducing attachment points and focusing on deploying capital to the insurance companies with higher quality portfolios like AIG. Given that this has become the industry norm, as I mentioned earlier, industry losses from increased frequency and severity will continue to be realized by primary insurers and will not be solved by the reinsurance market in 2025. Let me move on to provide an update on AIG Next, which we launched in early 2024 to further position AIG for the future. Over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify the company by weaving the organization together to operate seamlessly across underwriting, actuarial, claims and all of our functional areas with the necessary skills and capabilities to effectively differentiate AIG for the future. In 2025, we expect to fully realize the $500 mi"

In 2025, we expect to fully realize the $500 million in savings from AIG Next. These savings will impact multiple areas across other operations and General Insurance. As part of the AIG Next program, we've established a new definition of parent expense to exclusively reflect costs related to being a global regulated public company and expect those costs to be around $350 million going forward. In the future, costs currently attributed to other operations will either be eliminated or included within the General Insurance results. You can see the impact of this effort already flowing through our income statement as other operations expenses are down nearly $30 million year-over-year or $40 million sequentially. This reduction reflects the expense benefits from AIG Next and the transfer of a portion of these costs to General Insurance GOE. The ability of the businesses to absorb these additional costs with minimal impact to the expense ratio is due in large part to our significant focus on managing expenses. AIG Next has also enabled us to invest in core capabilities and the implementation of strategic innovation initiatives, notably in underwriting, claims and our data, digital and AI strategy. Let me provide you with more detail. Many companies are discussing their data, digital and AI strategies, but what is actually being done varies greatly from company to company. At AIG, we're utilizing GenAI in large language models as digital accelerators and applications that support the innovation journey, but they are not the innovation alone. This is what makes our recently announced collaborative space in Atlanta so unique. It will be the first location in our global footprint where an end-to-end underwriting process will exist from distribution, sales to data insights, underwriting, claims payments and client servicing. This location will allow us to innovate and evolve the end-to-end process, further develop our Agentic GenAI ecosystem, drive role clarity and digitize and modernize our processes. GenAI can produce meaningful gains from reducing manual inputs and driving process efficiencies. However, our GenAI ecosystem is doing much more than that. It integrates proprietary data from multiple sources with data ingestion capabilities to give us better data quality in a fraction of the time. In our early pilots, we've seen data collection and accuracy rates within our underwriting processes improve from levels near 75% to upwards of 90%, while reducing processing time significantly. We're also using our GenAI ecosystem to increase our submission response rate while enabling our underwriters to prioritize the highest value business within our risk appetite. These improvements will help drive growth and operating leverage as we deliver GenAI to our businesses at scale. It will allow our underwriters to spend more time quoting and winning business and less time manually collecting data. Our culture at AIG is one that is deeply rooted in underwriting expertise and excellence. We help clients solve complex risk issues that require judgment and a nuanced understanding of clients' needs, maintaining the underwriter at the center of decision making will continue to be paramount and a key differentiator for us. Our AI initiatives are designed to do just that, deliver better outcomes and drive operating leverage while keeping highly experienced underwriters at the core of the process. I'm now going to turn to capital management, where we continue to execute our balanced disciplined strategy. Our objectives are to preserve strong insurance company capital levels to support organic and potentially inorganic growth, maintain conservative debt leverage ratios, return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and maintain parent liquidity. We made substantial progress over the last several years to improve the financial strength of AIG. General Insurance is well positioned for sustained profitable growth. This has been a multi-year process that's centered on executing on our underwriting strategy, while increasing profitability and reducing volatility in our portfolio through a better mix of business along with the strategic use of reinsurance. An important result of our improved profitability is our ability to receive ordinary dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which provides consistent and increasing liquidity to the parent company. Year-to-date, we received ordinary dividends or their equivalents of approximately $3 billion from our businesses. Our financial strength is also evidenced by the lower levels of debt on our balance sheet, historically, AIG had one of the highest debt-to-total capital leverage ratios in the industry at over 30%. In 2024, we have reduced debt levels by $1 billion, bringing our debt-to-total capital leverage ratio to 17.9%, including AOCI, amongst the lowest in our peer group, an achievement that requires significant discipline. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned over $5.5 billion to shareholders through $4.8 billion of common stock repurchases and $765 million of dividends. As we've stated previously, we will continue to execute on our $10 billion share repurchase authorization over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions and timing of the closing of pending transactions. The current authorization will bring us within our target share count range of 550 million to 600 million shares. Importantly, our anticipated parent liquidity provides the flexibility to support additional share repurchases, which we will review in 2025. Earlier this year, we increased the cash dividend to shareholders on AIG common stock by 11%. We will continue to review our dividend annually, considering additional increases as appropriate, supported by our increased earnings power. This will be an important focus for us in 2025 and beyond. We ended the third quarter with parent liquidity of $4.2 billion. With the combination of our disciplined capital management, sustained continued underwriting performance and focus on expense management, we expect to deliver a 10% core operating ROE for the full-year 2025. We recognize that with core operating equity of $34.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, parent liquidity, our capital in the insurance company subsidiaries and future proceeds from corporate sell-downs, we have excess capital for the size of the business we are today. We will proactively manage our capital over time to support growth in our business and we will maintain a capital management strategy centered on balance and patience while remaining nimble to execute, should attractive opportunities arise. In summary, I'm very pleased with our outstanding third quarter performance, as we approach year end and plan for 2025, our path forward is clear. We will continue to solidify AIG's position as a global market leader and remain focused on value creation for our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on third quarter results for General Insurance, net investment income, other operations and capital. Turning to General Insurance. Adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion. Underwriting income was $437 million, including $411 million of catastrophe losses. Hurricanes Beryl and Helene were the two largest losses in the quarter. Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 and therefore, its financial impact will be recognized in the fourth quarter.

Claims activity to date for Milton has been relatively light compared to storms of similar strength and intensity. Our current preliminary loss estimate for Milton is between $175 million and $275 million. The third quarter 2024 accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, about 140 basis points higher than last year, principally due to changes in premium mix and reinsurance structure and favorable actual versus expected experience in the third quarter of 2023. We also had one large closeout transaction, which Peter mentioned that increased the consolidated loss ratio by about 40 basis points. Year-to-date, the accident year combined ratio is 88.1%, down 60 basis points from 2023. The accident year loss ratio was 56.4% for the quarter, including the impact of the closeout transaction and 56.4% year-to-date, flat with the first nine months of 2023. We expect the fourth quarter accident year loss ratio as adjusted, will be in line with the first nine months of this year. Turning to prior year development. This quarter, we had $153 million of favorable prior year development, including $34 million from the ADC amortization. During the quarter, we completed detailed valuation reviews or DVRs on almost $22 billion or 47% of our total loss reserves. We reviewed most of the reserves for international in addition to North America property and financial lines. Overall, we had favorable prior year development on short tail lines in global specialty and global commercial property and a modest amount in North America financial lines. This was partially offset by $181 million of adverse development in U.K. and Europe casualty and financial lines on about $8 billion of reserves. This reflects refinements in loss estimates due to recent claims emergence and settlement activity on specific exposures in accident years 2019 and prior, consistent with our reserving philosophy of addressing bad news quickly. In addition, we increased U.S. excess casualty reserves by $72 million due to a large settlement of a legacy mass tort claim also related to accident years 2019 and prior with most of the gross loss and accident years that were ceded to the ADC. We remain very comfortable with the adequacy of our loss reserves, having completed DVRs covering more than 90% of reserves year-to-date and considering the results of our monthly actual versus expected process and other claims diagnostics. While North America Financial Lines had a slight amount of favorable development from accident years 2021 and prior, we did not adjust loss reserves for more recent accident years, which have continued to show favorable indications relative to our books loss assumptions, consistent with our reserving philosophy of giving favorable experience time to mature. Turning to pricing and loss trends. Third quarter experience in Global Commercial Lines was consistent with second quarter 2024 trends. Excluding financial lines and workers' compensation, AIG's Global Commercial pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 6%, largely in line with loss cost trends. In North America Commercial, which is about half of our global commercial book, pricing excluding financial lines and workers' compensation was up 7% with rate up more than 5%. North America casualty rate increases were strong with Lexington averaging 16% and retail casualty averaging 13%. These are well above our casualty loss cost trends, which as we've previously disclosed are at 10% or higher depending on the line, risk and attachment point. Property rates in North America Retail and Lexington were consistent with second quarter and the underwriting margin remained strong, supported by cumulative rate increases over the past several years and our disciplined underwriting approach, particularly to CAT exposed property. Pricing in International commercial, excluding financial lines was up 4%, in line with loss trend and underwriting profitability remains very strong. International property continued to achieve overall pricing in excess of loss trend. Our global footprint and diverse portfolio enable us to remain agile, focusing on lines of business with attractive risk adjusted returns while maintaining underwriting discipline. We are confident that the overall strength of our portfolio positions us to deliver sustainable underwriting profitability. Turning to investments. Our investment portfolio is of high credit quality, well diversified by asset class and match to our liability duration. The increase in interest rates since 2021 has driven higher portfolio yields even as credit spreads have tightened. Third quarter 2024 net investment income on an APTI basis was $897 million, up 19% from the third quarter of 2023, driven by increased reinvestment rates on fixed maturities, higher short-term investment income, Corebridge dividends and other operations, slightly better private equity returns and lower investment expense. Reinvestment yields on fixed maturities and loans remains above runoff yields, providing positive yield pickup in the quarter. The average new money yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans was 60 basis points higher than sales and maturities adjusted for one large sale in the quarter. General Insurance investment income was $773 million, including income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of $718 million and alternative investment income of $43 million. Considering the current interest rate curve, we project fourth quarter General Insurance investment income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments to be approximately $710 million due to the impact of floating rate security resets, partially offset by higher reinvestment yields. About 11% of our fixed maturities have monthly or quarterly floating rate resets to SOFR or other short-term market indices, which began to decline in the third quarter. Alternative income is principally from traditional private equity and now includes real estate investment funds that were previously consolidated. These assets are reported on a one quarter lagged basis and based on third quarter market performance, we expect fourth quarter private equity results may be similar to the year-to-date annualized return of 3.5%. Turning to other operations. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $143 million, a nearly 50% year-over-year improvement driven by lower GOE and interest expense and higher net investment income, which totaled $125 million in the quarter. Considering both lower short-term rates and projected parent liquidity balances before proceeds from any strategic transactions, short-term investment income could decline in the fourth quarter by about $25 million sequentially. To wrap up the quarter, the balance sheet remains very strong. Book value per share was $71.46 at quarter end, up 4% from June 30, 2024, due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on AOCI. Book value per share increased 10% from year end 2023. Adjusted book value per share was $73.90, up 2% from June 30 due to reduced shares outstanding and was down 6% from year end 2023 due to different accounting treatment of Corebridge between the two periods. As Peter noted, our debt leverage ratios are very strong. We recently called a $400 million par zero coupon bond, which will close November 22. Core operating ROE, which measures the annualized return on AIG shareholders' equity, excluding the value of Corebridge shares and deferred tax assets, was 9.2% in the quarter and 9.3% year-to-date, reflecting strong General Insurance profitability and capital levels. To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustained underwriting results and a 10% core operating ROE in 2025, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. With tha"

I want to start with a question about reserves, if I can. You talked about how recent accident years financial lines are emerging better than expected, but you're not booking that yet. Can you talk a little bit about what's happening in the older accident years for, I guess financial lines or casualty, we saw the one-off issues, but I'm wondering more broadly, is there the same sort of theme in the older accident years that could be getting closer to acknowledgment.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Meyer. Good morning. I think Sabra provided quite a bit of detail in her prepared remarks, but Sabra, do you have anything to perhaps give a little bit of context on financial lines?\n\nSabra Purtill - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. And let me just make a few comments. I mean, obviously, we had very strong favorable development in the DVRs this quarter. Consistent with our approach, we have allowed favorable development to -- our favorable experience to mature. And this quarter, particularly on shorter tail lines, we had about $300 million of favorable development. I would just note that this quarter did not include workers' compensation that was done in the third quarter of last year and this year it was done in the second quarter and we'll do it in the second quarter for next year as well. What I would just comment on in terms of the -- I'll talk to the excess casualty first because I know that's been in some focus. The trigger for the action in North America casualty, excess casualty was for a particularly large settlement, growth of reinsurance, which was from very old accident years that were covered by the ADC. Absent this settlement, we would not have made any adjustments in that line because the DVRs for that line are done in the second quarter normally. Turning to financial lines. Let me just note that for the quarter in total, we had post-ADC, the adverse development on financial lines was about $28 million in total. That was driven by the adverse development on U.K. financial lines, which again was an older book with -- related to some specific exposures. We did actually recognize favorable development on the U.S. and international portfolios. And I would note that was for older accident years. The favorable development that we recognized is generally in older years where the experience has matured as the policy form is claims made, but we continue to hold reserves, obviously for those older accident years based on the existing claims or other activity within that book. And we will evaluate again in the third quarter of next year is when we'll do our deep dive on the Global Financial lines portfolio.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGreat. Thanks, Sabra. Meyer, is there a follow-up?\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nYes, just a quick one. Peter, you talked a lot about your expectations for a property reinsurance in 2025. And I was hoping for an update on your thought of the appropriate reinsurance program, property reinsurance program for AIG, whether you're thinking of other -- of changing your net exposure?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI covered a lot in my prepared remarks. Again, I think the industry has become experts on reinsurance pricing. And I expect that the market will be orderly, but I don't expect attachment points are going to come down for the industry. What I was trying to outline in my comments was that most of it is retained by insurance companies today. And so therefore, how we're going to price business going forward, how we're going to understand the frequency of CAT is going to be really important to do as an insurance company and not rely on reinsurance. I don't think we're going to have a material change in our structures. Of course, we have low attachment points. It's very complex and I won't spend a lot of time on it. But we certainly have the balance sheet. We certainly have the risk appetite to take a little bit more net in the event that we want to, but we like having low attachment points on severity and we like having our aggregate that protects us from frequency. And so we manage our net according to our risk appetite. It's within expectations and I would expect us to continue the same strategic philosophy.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, perfect. Thank you so much.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):"

Peter, I think we're hearing a little bit from other companies about some improvement in your casualty, particularly E&S, casualty lines and maybe properties' moderating. Wonder if you could give us some color on your view of market conditions and kind of organic growth opportunities here in the fourth quarter and heading into 2025.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Brian. And I'm going to make a comment. I'm going to have Don talk specifically about Lexington. But you're absolutely right. We see opportunities. Our clients, we have such strong retention and they're looking for us to solve risk issues. New business opportunities are very good. The rating environment is very good. So we're cautious, but we think there's opportunities to grow. In the retail casualty space, in multiple segments that we have as well as in E&S, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our casualty submissions in E&S have been dramatic and we see great growth opportunities there. But Don, maybe you could expand a little bit on the Lexington.\n\nDon Bailey - CEO, North America Insurance (AIG):\nGreat. And if I could, Peter, just maybe a couple of high-level comments on North America overall and then dig deeper into the Lex growth because they are kind of balanced. So the double-digit growth in North America is balanced growth. We're growing the lines where we see attractive opportunities. And to the point of your question, we're growing in all three channels where we operate, retail, wholesale, alternative. Peter covered some of the North American growth drivers, positive rate of 3% across the portfolio, strong retention of 87%, 90% in the admitted lines and then overall strong new business growth of 22%. On Lexington, we do continue to invest in Lex across all lines. So you'll see Lex continue to show up with more resources, more products, enhanced capabilities going forward. On the third quarter performance, as Peter mentioned, 78% per retention, which is really strong, a 24% increase in new business. And to the point of your question, casualty showed up very well in the E&S space in terms of new business for the quarter. We also saw a 35% increase in submission. So the submission activity continues to be very robust in the E&S space for us. It's generated probably by two things. One is just increasing demand for E&S solutions in general and a flight to quality within E&S. For me personally, when I think about the nature of a wholesale broker today versus when I started in this industry, it's a completely different game. The brokers in the wholesale space operate at a different level today, incredibly well resourced, data driven, effectively deployed technology to drive efficiency, which is critical in wholesale. They're also increasingly being embraced by thousands of independent agents for market access and placement capabilities. So Lex will continue to benefit from that trend in terms of the growth of our book and new business. And Peter, just a couple of data points to close out on E&S, which might be helpful. Today, E&S represents 12% of the $115 billion U.S. P&C industry. In 2018, E&S was 7% of a $50 billion industry. So the pie has gotten considerably larger. And the last data point I'd give you just on distribution. The top five wholesale brokers control over 65% of the growing $115 billion U.S. E&S market. Lex is very well positioned in E&S and very well positioned with these top brokers.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGreat. Thanks, Don. Brian, do you have a follow-up?\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nYes, absolutely. A bigger picture question here, Peter. So I think you said that you're expecting a 10% core ROE for 2025. If I look at peer companies, they're kind of trending in the mid to even higher-teens. Yes, what's your kind of longer-term view of kind of ROE aspirations you think you can get to peer ROEs and what do you think it's going to take to get there? Is it more margin improvement, you need to kind of grow acquisitions? Just curious bigger picture, your thoughts there.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes, thanks, Brian. I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about the 10% and gave guidance in my prepared remarks about getting to that in 2025. There's a variety of ways in which we can get there. We talked about our combined ratio and the opportunities to improve that. We have such a great underwriting culture and believe that there's lots of opportunities, of course, is market dependent, but our leadership position in the market allows us to remain disciplined and focused on clients. There's -- the other variables, I mean, certainly it's our equity base. We talked about that a little bit and that we believe we can grow into it and that's of course going to generate more earnings opportunity, our net investment income, net premiums written both from a peer growth in terms of strong retention, more new business, but also reinsurance structures, how we look at proportional versus excess of loss and there's ways in which we could have some tailwinds there. Quality of our reserves, which we continue to emphasize, Sabra gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks and on the answer just now. So we have a lot of confidence there. Capital management actions. We have lots of flexibility subject to when we close Nippon and do other capital market transactions, but there's lots of ways in which from a capital management standpoint allow us to improve. Our ability and track record to successfully manage volatility is very important. And then the last one is our expense management is very disciplined. We are executing on AIG Next. That showed itself in the third quarter. We're not looking to hit the ball out of the park every quarter leading in 2025. We pulled guidance forward that we will be able to get other operations, which was substantially higher to a $350 million lean parent, but also get the expenses either eliminated or into the business without increasing the combined ratio. We're well underway. You can see evidence of that in the third quarter. You'll see more evidence of that in the fourth quarter. So there's a bunch of ways in which I think that we can deliver it. And once we get north of the 10%, we'll provide guidance after that. But thank you.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Can you give us an update on your appetite for M&A and how that might help you reach premium leverage objectives quicker than organically?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSure, Rob. Thanks. I'll start with the second part. The guidance we gave was that we would do $10 billion of share repurchases in '24 and '25. And so like you can see through the third quarter, we are well underway executing every quarter. We'll have more liquidity coming in. And so that's the priority with the proceeds coming in from Nippon and as I said, other marketed deals and liquidity that we currently have at the parent company. In terms of M&A, we have given ourselves lots of options. We have the financial strength, the financial flexibility to explore inorganic opportunities. We're always looking at ways in which we can add strategic relevance and something that's compelling to AIG. We already have sizable very high-quality businesses in major markets. I mean, you know about the U.S., U.K., Japan, Singapore, Europe. We believe we can grow those businesses organically, but there may be more opportunities to expand inorganically as well. We're going to remain very disciplined, but we are going to look at businesses and opportunities in inorganic that may complement our geographical footprint or product capabilities. There's opportunities maybe to go into spaces that we're not in today, maybe some of the SME or looking at ones that enhance scale of businesses that we already have market leadership that just will accelerate our ability to execute our risk-adjusted returns. So I want to remain very disciplined, very patient, but we have the financial flexibility and the strategic intent of growing.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay, great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, on GOE and General Insurance, it didn't necessarily appear like it decreased as much as the run rate in the first half of the year. So I was just hoping you could discuss kind of the puts and takes in the General Insurance GOE ratio and if this level of improvement is sort of in line with expectations.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. I was actually quite pleased with the third quarter in GOE because we looked at other operations and the significant improvement that we made there on the GOE line year-over-year and then sequentially, but also we are absorbing a lot of the expenses as they get pushed into the business. And so while the personal insurance year-over-year, the nominal was down and then on commercial, it was slightly up. When you look at putting $50 million more of cost in, the run rate is actually quite attractive. And so we have two major initiatives that have begun to earn in the third quarter, but you'll start to see a lot more of that in the fourth quarter. And as we get to 2025, one was our voluntary early retirement plan that we had announced in the United States. And then we did a restructuring international that just really happened in September. And so you'll start to see more run rate as we get into the fourth quarter and next year. But I'm really pleased with what we did in the third quarter and believe we are showing a lot of sequential improvement in executing to this future state operating model that's going to be much leaner, much simpler and much easier to follow.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

And I guess thinking through both leverage down at the operating companies as well as financial leverage. But when I look at the ROE, that seems to be the place where you're under index versus some of the peers, not so much like the actual combined ratio and so forth. So I was interested in, I guess on the debt leverage side, are we at a place where leverage can actually begin to come up as you see opportunities, particularly if you do engage in M&A? And then on the core operations, I mean can you frame at all like how much dry powder you see in terms of being able to lean into some of these opportunities if they get better at casualty?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nSo thanks, Alex, for the question on leverage, yes, we have a lot of -- I think it goes into what I said about potential M&A where we've given ourselves a lot of financial flexibility if we find something compelling and attractive. I think the high teens of a leverage to total capital, including AOCI, we're very comfortable with, but absolutely what you were asking is a truth, which is if we find opportunities, can we increase our leverage to be able to execute on that? The answer is yes, we can. And we're going to be very mindful. Obviously, the primary use for proceeds from the Corebridge sell-down will go to share repurchase, but we could continue to work on leverage a little bit to give us even more financial flexibility over time. In terms -- I just want to make sure I understand the second part which is having -- we have a lot of capital. I don't think it's a moment in time and to quantify what we think is excess today, I don't think is something that is overly constructive just because we intend to grow into that. We have shown real opportunities in our business to acquire new business. We had a terrific new business quarter. That momentum continues. And I think look at them, property was probably the one that was sort of slowing down in terms of pricing, but Milton and Helene have changed a lot. And I think that there'll be more flight to quality and there'll be more flexibility for AIG in terms of our ability to drive property growth and on a risk-adjusted basis throughout the world. And so like I think the balanced portfolio opportunities to grow, being able to take more net and being able to hit that 10% ROE is our near-term objective.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up on personal lines in North America. Can you just give us an update on sort of where we stand with that MGA structure that was put in place and over what period of time you'd expect that combined ratio to come down below 100%?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thank you for the question. I mean, North America personal is in transition as we as we've spoke about. It's hard in the primary high net worth business to affect change fast, but we're making great progress. In the quarter alone, the attritional loss ratio has improved on a meaningful basis, GOEs down. What you're seeing is the acquisition ratio increased quite a bit as we transition to the MGU. Now there's a few things happening that will reverse that in 2025. One is we're at scale, everything is fully put into the MGU and we expect the ceding commission that we paid to go down, I think in a meaningful way. And so the acquisition expense ratio will improve accordingly. I want to talk a little bit about like the strategy that we talked about, which is going into more non-admitted and how that's going to accelerate progress. And we announced it last quarter, but just a couple of statistics that will frame why it's early days, but it's working. The rate environment that we're in on an emitted basis in high net worth, we increased 10% in E&S. It went up 20% on our held book. Our partnership with Ryan Specialty, they're building infrastructure, building sales capacity. We're appointing a lot of retail agents that had no access to AIG or capital for high net worth before our signing up. We expect that to accelerate and continue to grow. In the third quarter, our new business, 50% of it was E&S. Again, we had good growth. I mean, the nominal is not going to move the needle, but we have momentum there. And I would expect in 2025, E&S alone in our strategy will grow the top line 10%. The demand is going to be significant. Our ability to be able to respond to that demand is there with plenty of capacity and an appetite that is going to allow us to improve the risk-adjusted returns and the overall combined ratio.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

If I adjust out the one-off -- the one-off in the quarter, right, the -- it came in at 61.1% on an ex-CAT accident year loss ratio basis. You guys are at 61.9% in the first half of the year. So I was just hoping to get more colors on what drove the improvement in the quarter and if that's sustainable into the fourth quarter and 2025.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThis is not going to be like the 91.6% question, is it Elyse? Don, do you want to just give a little bit of insight in terms of what's happening with the loss ratio?\n\nDon Bailey - CEO, North America Insurance (AIG):\nSo in the North American portfolio this year, we've seen some different movements, Peter. And in some of it, if you look at, we have some one-off movements that certainly moved the loss ratio on this one, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. We talked a little bit about the one-time closeout deal that we did that moved it up. So adverse implications.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI think, look, and in the commentary, Elyse, we sort of backed out the two -- they weren't headwinds, they were just anomalies relative to what the prior year was. And then the mix of business will continue to change. We see real opportunities to grow in -- in casualty and so those may have a different loss ratio relative to the overall portfolio. We think there's going to be growth opportunities in property based on the market dynamics that are shifting in 2025 and we see that the headwinds on pricing in financial lines are slowing down. We are not going to continue to ride that way down. And on lead, first excess and leading in D&O, I think Don highlighted this is that we've seen a slowdown in the rate reductions. And as we look into 2025, that's all going to stabilize. So I think that mix, if you take out the two things we talked about, which was significant outperformance in property and short tail last year in the third quarter along with the closeout that looks like a loss ratio that's sustainable.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. That's all. Yes, that's my follow-up, I guess, would be, Peter, just building upon that comment as you view the market conditions out over the next year, how do you expect the mix to shift between property and casualty relative to where it is today?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nIt's hard to tell because I -- as I mentioned before, I think the property slowdown in terms of rate increases should start to reverse as you get to next year because there's so much net that's been retained by insurance companies that they're not getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns for the cat loss at the low return periods and the increased frequency and severity. So I think that's going to reverse. Casualty is very strong, and Don went into length on excess and surplus lines. And then also you know we're seeing slowdown in financial lines. And so I think that the overall index, I think is going to sustain, but we'll see when we get into the market and see what happens within particular property, but I'm optimistic, that's why I put some time into it in the prepared remarks that we see a rate environment that's going to improve. I don't know, Jon, maybe like we -- just before the call ends, you can give a little bit of perspective in terms of where you see opportunities as we look to 2025 and international.\n\nJon Hancock - CEO, International Insurance (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Peter. And I'll try not to repeat everything you've said, but you're right, the dynamic between the first-party lines and the third-party lines is there across international as well. And we've seen first-party lines, we're still seeing good rate and price on property classes. But for me, bit like Don with Lex, we've got these jaws in Global Specialty and Talbot. Global specialty, we are the number one writer of business around the world. We're number one in energy, we're number one in marine. We're top three in aviation. We're number four in credit. And we're growing that business really well. You referenced in your prepared remarks, Peter, 6% growth in the quarter, but actually huge growth in energy, 25% new business growth in marine in the quarter. We're seeing a different dynamic at the moment where we've grown our international specialty book by 10% in the quarter. Yes, Talbot, again, another 6% growth, but the specialty lines at Talbot, the products at Talbot is really renowned for political risks. Marine and energy growing by 18%. If you look at -- add that to the fact that submissions are 25%, up in both Talbot and specialty, our quote rates are higher, our bind rates are higher. And we've got huge opportunity there and we're the best of the market at it. So we'll still keep seeing the opportunity.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThat's great, Jon. Thank you very much and I agree. Before I finally close, I do want to take a moment to thank Sabra for her many contributions at AIG. Over the past five years, Sabra has always been willing to take on a variety of important complex roles and in each instance, she's always done everything she can to add significant value. So thank you, Sabra, including the most recent role as CFO. We wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors as we welcome Keith Walsh as our new CFO. I also like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment and teamwork and execution and I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Have a great day."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9th, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with US GAAP. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, AIG realigned its organizational structure and the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in how AIG manages its operations, which our Chief Financial Officer, Keith Walsh, will discuss in detail during his remarks. Finally, today's remarks related to AIG's adjusted after tax income per diluted share as well as General Insurance results, including key metrics such as underwriting income, margin, and net investment income are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re as applicable. Net premiums written and net premiums earned are also presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services, Validus Re, and the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to pages 37 through 39 of the earnings presentation for reconciliation of such metrics reportable on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide additional perspectives on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at AIG, I want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the recent wildfires in California on families, communities and the businesses affected. Our local teams remain on the ground in California, providing critical expertise and support to our customers and partners. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder of the escalating risks, elevated catastrophe landscape and the complicated evolving environment that we operate in. It also underscores AIG's purpose to help our customers and clients navigate these challenges with resilience in rebuilding communities and restoring businesses. Let me take a moment to cover what I will walk you through during my remarks this morning. First, I will briefly share highlights from our strong fourth quarter performance. Second, I will discuss our 2024 strategic and operational accomplishments. Third, I will provide an overview of the full year financial results for AIG and our General Insurance business. Fourth, I will comment on the reinsurance market, including the January 1 renewals and provide some observations on the impact of the recent California wildfires. And lastly, I'll provide an update on the progress we have made on our capital management strategy, our path to achieving a 10% plus core ROE and how we are positioning the company for 2025. Let's begin with the fourth quarter results. We recently announced a realignment of our General Insurance business into three segments. North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. All of our comments will be aligned to these segments. During the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional underwriting results and we maintained rigorous expense discipline. General Insurance reported strong net premiums written of $6.1 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year led by 8% growth in Global Commercial lines. Global Commercial generated new business of $1.1 billion a 16% increase year-over-year along with continued strong retention of 86% across the portfolio. Net premiums earned of $6 billion grew 6% year-over-year. Adjusted after tax income per share grew 5% year-over-year to $1.30 per share. The calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%. And the accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.6% which was an outstanding result. 2024 was a terrific year of accomplishments for AIG, during which we not only delivered strong financial performance, but also successfully executed significant strategic and operational initiatives. We delivered disciplined growth in our businesses with a primary focus on risk adjusted returns supported by our underwriting expertise. We reshaped the portfolio, including divesting a number of non-core businesses. Following the sale of Validus Re in November of 2023, we closed on the sale of the global individual personal travel insurance business in December of 2024 to further position us for the future. While these divestitures help to further simplify AIG, the biggest accomplishment of the year was the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. The separation was a four year journey during which we strategically positioned Corebridge for its future while creating a new capital structure for AIG. Some of the major milestones of the Corebridge journey included establishing a very important partnership with Blackstone through an initial 9.9% sale in 2021, executing the largest US IPO in 2022, setting up a strategic asset management partnership with BlackRock, divesting non-core foreign businesses, completing five successful secondary offerings, two of which were in 2024 and culminating in the fourth quarter with AIG sale of a 22% stake in Corebridge for $3.8 billion to Nippon Life, securing another strategic partner for the company. With the accounting deconsolidation of Corebridge, AIG is now a less complex and more streamlined global business. AIG Next was another operational accomplishment in the year, which further supported our journey to make the company leaner, weave the organization together and reduce expenses. We exited 2024 achieving $450 million in run rate savings as part of the program and we expect the remaining benefits to be realized in the first half of 2025. We also continue to successfully execute on our capital management strategy in a very disciplined manner with nearly $10 billion of actions in 2024. AIG reduced shares outstanding by 12% and increased the quarterly dividend per share by 11%, resulting in the return of $8.1 billion of capital to shareholders. We received over $4 billion in dividends from our subsidiaries due to the improved profitability of our operations. We further reduced our debt to total capital ratio to 17% and we ended the year with $7.7 billion of parent liquidity. Our capital management actions to-date have provided us with tremendous financial flexibility. Another strategic accomplishment in 2024 was the delivery of AIG's f"

Another strategic accomplishment in 2024 was the delivery of AIG's first generative artificial intelligence large language model powered solution to support business growth. Specifically, we implemented AIG Underwriter Assist, which automates qualitative unstructured data extraction from underlying submissions, internal AIG data sources, and external research in minutes to support underwriter review of submissions. To support and advance our GenAI aspirations, we've cultivated an ecosystem of top tier technology partners, including Palantir, Anthropic and AWS in support of an agentic architecture operating model that allows for maximum flexibility. We also launched the Reinsurance Syndicate 2478 at Lloyd's through a multiyear strategic relationship with Blackstone as part of AIG's Outwards Reinsurance Program. The syndicate began underwriting on January 1, 2025 and now serves as a key component of AIG's reinsurance strategy, which I will go over in more detail later. Turning to the financial results for the full year 2024. Adjusted after tax income was $3.3 billion or $4.95 per diluted share, an increase of 28% year-over-year. The improvement was primarily driven by stronger underlying underwriting results, expense reduction benefits from AIG Next, an increase in net investment income and the execution of our balanced capital management strategy. General Insurance delivered terrific financial performance for 2024. For the full year, net premiums written were $23.9 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. Net premiums earned were $23.5 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.2%, which marked the sixth consecutive year of improvement, largely driven by the GOE ratio. The full year General Insurance combined ratio was 91.8%. This was the third consecutive year of a sub-92% combined ratio. Prior year reserve development, net of reinsurance and prior year premium was $289 million a benefit of 1.4 points to the loss ratio. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $1.9 billion roughly in line with the prior year despite higher catastrophe losses. In Global Commercial, net premiums written of $16.8 billion increased 7% year-over-year. North America Commercial grew net premiums written by 9% year-over-year. Lexington grew net premiums written by 14% fueled by robust new business of $1.1 billion and a 42% increase in submissions year-over-year, and that was balanced across all lines. Retail casualty grew net premiums written by 11%, excluding the closeout transaction we mentioned in the third quarter. Our portfolio continues to benefit from a strong rate environment, high retention of our existing portfolio at 93%, and we have select opportunities in new business. International Commercial grew net premiums written by 4% year-over-year, driven by energy at 13%, retail property at 11% and Talbot at 7%. Global Personal grew net premiums written by 3% year-over-year, driven by International Personal Auto at 8% and our high net worth business at 6%. I would now like to turn to reinsurance and provide some observations on the market and an update on AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. Overall, AIG had a very strong 01/01 renewal season. Since the reinsurance market's major reset on January 1 of 2023 our consistency in strategy, placement and execution has positioned us very favorably. Benefiting from an environment of higher retentions and commensurate pricing increases, property reinsurers sought to deploy more capital, but were predominantly focused on upper layers with more remote return periods. Depending on loss activity, limited additional demand led to risk adjusted rate reductions that were consistent with expectations, with the bottom catastrophe layers renewing flat to down 5% and upper catastrophe layers receiving reductions of 10% to 15%. I want to provide some context and observations on the changes in the market as a result of the increase in reinsurance retentions, which I've mentioned on previous calls is creating an interesting dynamic for the market in 2025. One insightful statistic from an Aon study of over 150 companies over the past ten years is that retentions have risen significantly around the world with the US attachment points on average increasing by 280%. As a reminder, in 2024, insured loss from natural catastrophes was approximately 145 billion. The sixth costliest on record and this compares to the average for the last five years of 140 billion. With the increased retentions and increased catastrophe activity, much more of the risk is now being retained by insurance companies. In 2023 and 2024, primary insurance carriers are estimated to retain approximately 90% of the insured loss from natural catastrophes with the reinsurance industry absorbing 10%. Contrast this with the period prior to 2023, reinsurers would often share a significantly higher proportion of the insured loss with the distribution of losses between insurers and reinsurers at approximately 50-50 on average. Meanwhile, AIG is focused on maintaining lower excess of loss attachment points, including meaningful aggregate coverage to manage frequency of loss tailored to our geographic exposure and to the type of perils that we are exposed. Taking a closer look at wildfires and how the market has changed, the average annual insured loss from 2000 to 2024 was approximately 4 billion globally of which the US is the majority at 3.5 billion Narrow that period to the last ten years and average annual losses from wildfires have roughly doubled to around 8 billion of which 7.4 billion has occurred in the United States. Insured loss estimates for the California wildfires are currently coalescing around 40 billion with some estimates from credible catastrophe experts reaching as high as 50 billion. The economic loss is estimated to be in excess of 250 billion producing a protection gap of as much as 80%. Contrast that to the top 10 largest insured cat events on record, where insurance has typically covered 40% to 50% of the economic loss. As a point of reference, insurance covered approximately 50% of the economic loss from Hurricane Katrina, the largest natural catastrophe event this century. The California wildfires demonstrate the increased loss from secondary perils and the magnitude of tail events that are not captured well in modeling. In a month with one of the lowest model probabilities of loss, the California wildfires alone would make the first quarter of 2025 the second most costly first quarter for natural catastrophes on record. Fifteen years ago, adjusting for inflation, 100 billion was considered the benchmark for an outsized cat year. With the last eight years averaging more than 140 billion this thinking is clearly outdated. If you assume the upper end of the range for the California wildfires taking a $50 billion loss pick, adding the average annual insured loss for the past eight years, and assuming we have an active, but not abnormal wind season, which is realistic given the 2024 hurricane season experience and ocean temperatures are the warmest on record, 2025 could be a year of more than 200 billion of insured catastrophe losses. This could recalibrate the entire industry. AIG reduced our overall California exposure beginning in 2022. This decision, coupled with our 2025 reinsurance structure has effectively reduced our exposure such that the expected loss to AIG from the recent wildfires is approximately 500 million before reinstatement premiums and barring any unforeseen additional developments. Turning specifically to AIG's reinsurance outcomes at 01/01, we successfully maintained our prior objectives, our reinsurance purchasing strategy to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of"

      "raw_bytes": "we successfully maintained our prior objectives, our reinsurance purchasing strategy to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. Starting with our property catastrophe placements, our core commercial North America retention of 500 million remains unchanged in nominal terms for the third consecutive year despite growth in the underlying portfolio. We also expanded coverage and maintained our core international occurrence attachments and renewed our dedicated occurrence tower for our high net worth business, which attaches at 200 million. We improved our 500 million of aggregate protection by reducing the annual aggregate deductible for North America, creating a specific non-peak section and expanding the coverage for the high net worth portfolio. Overall, for North America, depending on loss distribution, AIG's modeled net first loss exposure, including the impact of reinstatement premiums is comparable to 2024 and our second and third event exposure is materially lower following its renewal cycle. For all of our major proportional treaties, we were able to improve or maintain our ceding commission levels, a strong recognition of our underwriting expertise and our position as a market leader across multiple classes. We were also able to establish two new proportional treaties to support the high net worth portfolio. Our strategy to establish Private Client Select as a standalone MGU and introduce capacity to support growth in the platform beyond AIG's balance sheet has been validated with the addition of five of the leading underwriting companies in the world to the platform, taking 30% of our homeowners and auto portfolios through quota share reinsurance. Casualty remains an area of caution for many reinsurers with appetite generally diminished. They are highly selective of the insurance companies they support. And overall, the casualty renewals were more orderly for the companies that have strong underwriting portfolios. We were pleased with the successful renewal of our core casualty treaties at favorable terms. This renewal cycle again signals the strong external industry recognition that AIG continues to be a leader in the casualty market. We remain optimistic on the outlook for our casualty portfolio and see considerable opportunities ahead, while being cautious and very focused on maintaining our high underwriting standards. Also of significance for AIG at 01/01 was our launch of a new dedicated reinsurance syndicate at Lloyd's supported by funds managed by Blackstone. This pioneering structure announced in December 2024 is an example of how insurance risk can be directly connected to sophisticated investors to generate attractive returns for both parties. The syndicate provides AIG with a long-term meaningful reinsurance partner and an additional source of fee income. Blackstone has access to a high quality, well diversified underwriting portfolio with the ability to generate attractive returns by taking a sizable participation in the majority of AIG's outward reinsurance treaties at market terms. We're pleased to partner with a leading global asset manager on its innovative structure. Our reinsurance strategy has played a pivotal role in our journey to establish AIG as an industry leading global P&C underwriter. We're grateful for the long-term support and partnership of the industry's leading reinsurers, which has helped position us where we are today. Turning to capital management, we continue to execute very well on our balance and disciplined strategy. We made major progress in 2024 and in many ways exceeded expectations. As we outlined last year, our guidance was to repurchase $10 billion of shares in 2024 and in 2025. The current guidance is expected to bring us within our target share count range of 550 million to 600 million shares. We have $3.4 billion of the $10 billion guidance that I provided remaining for 2025. We will likely exceed this guidance and we have over $5.6 billion remaining on our current share repurchased authorization. We expect to return to more normalized levels of share repurchases as we enter 2026, assuming we have no further sell downs of Corebridge or other additional sources of liquidity. We ended the year with a very strong parent liquidity of $7.7 billion. Additionally, we do not anticipate taking any actions that would significantly affect leverage in 2025. We are committed to reviewing our dividend annually and anticipate that we will increase our dividend in 2025 in line with the decrease in our share count over the past year, subject to AIG board approval. Going forward, our key focus is on profitable growth and allocating capital to the best opportunities for the most attractive risk adjusted returns. Our very early forecast indicates we're off to a strong start for 2025 and barring any unforeseen developments, we expect to achieve meaningful organic growth driven by our Global Commercial business and the benefits of our restructured reinsurance program. As a result of our disciplined capital management, combined with our sustained underwriting excellence and continued focus on expense management, we're well on track to deliver a 10% plus core operating ROE for the full year 2025. We have several ways in which we can deliver on this commitment. These are maintaining our strong underwriting results with a focus on improving Global Personal, improving our investment income yields, executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG and continued balanced capital management. In summary, I'm very pleased with our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2024 performance. 2025 is a new chapter for AIG and we're moving forward with strong momentum. We continue to differentiate ourselves with deep industry expertise and disciplined focus on underwriting excellence and outstanding operations and claims capabilities, which drive exceptional value for our clients, partners and stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on fourth quarter results for General Insurance, net investment income and other operations as well as key balance sheet items. I would like to begin by addressing a few changes in our financial reporting. As Peter mentioned, we have realigned our General Insurance business into three reporting segments. North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. Global Personal lines have been consolidated into a single reporting segment. This brings together our Global Accident and Health, Personal Home and Auto, Global Warranty and Services and High Net Worth businesses. Along with our new reporting segments, we have updated the product line net premiums written disclosure on Page 8 of our financial supplement to give more transparency into the underlying trends in our businesses. The three segments and updated product line disclosure are reflected retrospectively in AIG's 2024 fourth quarter and full year financial results. Additionally, we have streamlined other operations to include activities only related to having a global regulated parent company and now exclude the results of runoff businesses from adjusted pre-tax income. We believe these changes enhance the clarity of our financial disclosures and provide a better representation and alignment of our core business. Historical results have been recast to reflect these changes with de minimis impact to operating EPS. Other operations now largely consists of net investment income from our parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate general operating expenses and interest expense. Turning to our fourth quarter General Insurance results. Adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion. In North America commercial, net premiums written increased 9% year-over-year, driven by strong new bus"

      "raw_bytes": " our fourth quarter General Insurance results. Adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion. In North America commercial, net premiums written increased 9% year-over-year, driven by strong new business, which grew 17% with retention of 85%. International Commercial net premiums written increased 7% year-over-year with new business growth of 15% and excellent retention of 88%. In Global Personal, net premiums written increased 1% on a constant currency basis. The sale of the Global Personal Travel and Assistance business, which closed in early December, was about a four point headwind to the year-over-year comparison. Adjusting for that, growth was 5% in the quarter on a comparable basis, driven by 16% growth in our Global High Net Worth business. The sale of the Global Personal Travel business will have an impact on the Global Personal segment in 2025. For full year 2024, this segment had $7.1 billion of net premiums written. When modeling 2025, the sale of the Global Travel business will remove approximately $720 million of net premiums written. This is a roughly 10 percentage point growth impact for the segment. General Insurance underwriting income for the quarter was $454 million, a $156 million decrease from the prior year quarter, driven entirely by higher catastrophe losses. General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.6%, a 30 basis point increase from the prior year quarter. This was driven by a slight increase in the accident year loss ratio, while the expense ratio remained flat despite absorbing more AIG parent expenses. Catastrophe losses were $325 million or 5.5 points on the loss ratio. This includes $224 million of losses from Hurricane Milton and an adjustment for prior quarters events largely from Hurricane Helene, which occurred on the final day of the third quarter. Turning to reserves and our detailed valuation reviews or DVRs. This quarter, General Insurance had $102 million of favorable prior year development, including $34 million from the ADC amortization, $16 million from our fourth quarter DVRs and $52 million from non-DVR adjustments, predominantly recognition of AVE on US short-tail lines. The fourth quarter's DVRs covered the remaining 10% or approximately $4 billion of our total loss reserves focusing on the remaining portion of US financial lines, global personal lines Canada and Glatfelter. The favorable prior year development was primarily driven by Canada Casualty and US E&O. We conduct a comprehensive DVR annually for each product line across our $40 billion of reserves. While DVRs are spread across quarters, we have a robust year-round process on our entire book in addition to our quarterly DVRs. Going forward, our comments will focus less on reporting the DVR outcomes and more on our overall reserve analysis, which reflects AVE claims diagnostics and rate monitoring across all lines and geographies. One additional item I would like to discuss is a provisional reserve we created in 2022 in response to the potential uncertainty with inflation and other variables in the post-pandemic macro environment. This provision, which is included in IBNR, has been carried in the lines that we viewed as most susceptible to rising inflation with a large portion booked in our workers' compensation reserves. This year, we undertook a thorough review of the uncertainty provision which was set above the loss picks from our actuarial reviews and refined our analysis, including its allocation among our lines of business. The uncertainty provision did not reflect any emergence and we have maintained the overall estimate. However, we have decided to reduce the provision in excess workers' comp and reapportion approximately $150 million of the provision within excess casualty. We elected to move this portion of the reserve to excess casualty as the development factors and the length of the tail can drive a wider range of outcomes on our reserves. To be clear, our traditional reserve methods are not indicating any emergence in excess casualty, but we felt, given the nature of the provision, it was more appropriate to be situated within this line. As a reminder, our reserving philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and wait to recognize good news over time as we monitor developments. Moving on to rates and pricing. Fourth quarter Global Commercial Lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 5% year-over-year, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. In North America Commercial, renewal rate increased 3% year-over-year or 7% if you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines. Exposures increased 2% year-over-year with an all-in pricing change above loss cost trend. Property market conditions were under pressure in the fourth quarter due to increased competition across both the admitted and E&S markets, while the underwriting margin remained healthy. Supported by the cumulative rate increases over the past several years and our disciplined approach. In North America Casualty lines, rate continued to outpace loss cost trend with increases in the mid-teens in wholesale and excess casualty. In North America financial lines, we continue to experience headwinds, but see indications that rate reductions are moderating. In International Commercial, overall pricing was flat or up 2% excluding financial lines. While rate is below trend, we feel good about our book given we've had over 60% cumulative risk-adjusted rate since 2018. Our well-diversified portfolio allows us to navigate different market conditions effectively prioritizing lines of business that offer the most compelling risk adjusted returns while upholding our underwriting standards. For the full year 2024, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, Global Commercial lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 6%, with 8% in North America and 4% in International. Turning to other operations. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax loss was $150 million, which improved 34% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower GOE reflecting AIG Next benefits as well as incremental movement of GOE into General Insurance. We continue to realize the benefits of AIG Next and push nonpublic company-related expenses into the business. We expect corporate GOE expenses to migrate towards approximately a $90 million per quarter run rate over the course of 2025. Interest expense improved $10 million year-over-year, as a result of our liability management, which reduced total debt by $1.6 billion in 2024. One other item I want to discuss is a runoff business, Blackboard. In the fourth quarter, we increased the prior accident year reserves for Blackboard by $112 million to reflect loss activity that has been well above what was expected. Turning now to investment income. For the full year 2024, net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from 2023, primarily driven by Corebridge dividends, an increase in short-term investment income and higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities. Fourth quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $872 million largely unchanged year-over-year. General Insurance net investment income was $779 million, including income on fixed maturities, loans and short-term investments of $720 million and alternative investment income of $72 million. Other operations net investment income was $93 million, consisting of income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $64 million and Corebridge dividend income of $29 million. During the fourth quarter, we continued to benefit from higher reinvestment rates on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio. The average new money yield of 5.38% was roughly 175 basis points higher than the sales and maturities in the quarter. The annualized yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio, excluding calls and prepayments was 3.92%, up four basis points year-over-year or three basis points sequentially. The"

The annualized yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio, excluding calls and prepayments was 3.92%, up four basis points year-over-year or three basis points sequentially. The fourth quarter alternative investment income was $67 million, an increase of $26 million year-over-year, driven by improved private equity performance, partially offset by lower hedge fund income owing to our strategy to reduce exposure. Private equity yielded 6.42% for the quarter, below our long-term expected return of 7.5%. The makeup of our private equity portfolio is a little over 25% real estate and with the current macro environment, we expect pressure from this portion of the portfolio to continue through 2025. Turning to tax. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year was 24.6%. For 2025, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with 2024, but may vary based on the geographic mix of income. We finished 2024 with a very strong balance sheet. Book value per share was $70.16 at year-end, up 8% from December 31st, 2023, mainly due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on AOCI and reduced shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per share was $73.79 down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to the impact of Corebridge deconsolidation. Core operating ROE was 9.1% in the quarter and for the full year. As Peter laid out, we are committed to achieving our target of a 10% plus core operating ROE for the full year 2025. As Peter mentioned, we had a substantial $6.6 billion returned to shareholders in 2024 through share repurchases and are well on our way to completing our guidance of $10 billion of repurchases in 2024 and 2025. Through February 7, we have repurchased $952 million of shares year-to-date in 2025. We are proud of the significant progress we've made in 2024 and the ability to deliver outstanding core operating results while successfully executing significant transformation initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThank you, Keith and Michelle, we're ready for questions.."

First one I have for you, excuse me, is on the core ROE that you gave. I just wanted to confirm that that's including the wildfire impact. And it looks like it's running a bit better than I would have expected based on the combined ratios that you've talked about in the past and corporate expenses and so forth. So I was just interested if you define it all on maybe some of the things that you're running ahead on or that are improving relative to some of those comments you've made in the past? Thanks.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYes. Certainly, Alex. And, yes, we are confirming the 10% plus ROE including the $500 million wildfire that we had in January. If I could spend a second, I think we've done an exceptional job over the past few years of structuring our sort of global portfolio structuring the reinsurance to supplement that and having net retentions well within our expectations and what we budget. If I look at what we do budget for AAL over the last couple of years relative to our overall experience, it's been exactly where we anticipated even with elevated activity. So this is no different. I mentioned on the call that we're going to take first event losses around the same with reinsurance that we did in 2024, but second and third events will be less. And so that's how we structured it. And we are confirming guidance on the 10% including what happened in January. I think Keith noted that we have a lot of different ways in which we can sort of drive improvement in terms of earnings. I did as well in my prepared remarks. We're really pleased with the commercial portfolio and how it's performed on a combined ratio basis. We just continue to, I think, elevate our overall performance. I have singled out personal because I think that combined ratio is not where any of us want to be. We consolidated that under one leader. Jon Hancock, he's shown exceptional leadership in what he's done with the commercial portfolio in international. And I think it's going to give us a much better line of sight on the overall portfolio in terms of how we can improve it, which we fully expect to do. I think there's opportunities in NII further capital management. And I think we reconfirmed what we're doing on return of capital to shareholders. So I think we have a lot of very positive momentum and want to confirm guidance. Do you have a follow-up, Alex?\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nYes. So as a follow-up, I'd just be interested in some of the areas you're targeting towards organic growth. And maybe in particular, your updated view on price adequacy just given some of the declines in property pricing in E&S and then maybe also on casualty?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nOkay. I'm going to have Jon Hancock and Don Bailey talk a little bit about the growth because they've done an exceptional job in terms of outlining where our portfolio can grow, focusing on risk-adjusted returns. What I would say and this is complementing their efforts is that we've just done a tremendous job in terms of client retention focusing on an underwriting culture of maintaining and improving profitability. And so like we deploy capital where we think we have the best opportunities for improved risk adjusted returns. And they've done an exceptional job on new business in targeting parts of our business where we think we can have those outsized returns over time. And I think that's how you've seen the portfolio shape. So Jon why don't I start with you in terms of international and maybe give us a little bit of insight in terms of the growth.\n\nJon Hancock - CEO, International General Insurance (AIG):\nYes. Okay. Thanks, Peter, and Alex. Growth through retention and new business was strong in the quarter. Peter and Keith called out a lot of that in their opening remarks, so I won't repeat it now. But what I will say is, we're working from such a strong base in this commercial portfolio in international. And when we look at where we've been growing, if you look at the quarter, there's a lot of seasonality across international. For example, in Q4, 50%, more than 50% of our net premiums come from just two lines. We like the global specialty and financial lines, but that's not the full year mix. So I think looking at growth, looking at new business, quarter-on-quarter isn't always the most insightful way. And Q4 is obviously the end of the year as well. So I think it's a good time to reflect on what we've been doing the whole of 2024 and talk about that momentum that we have been building. If I look at the full year, Keith called it out, 4% growth in the year across International Commercial. Renewal retention in the full year, 89%. I'm really, really pleased with that on such a good book of business. And new business for the year, more than $2 billion of new business during the year in International Commercial. Again, a great outcome, really reflective of the fact that we're still seeing great new business opportunities all around the world actually. And I also do want to make clear that new business is a big driver of our growth. We manage the quality, the price advocacy of our new business just as closely as we do our renewal book. And we trade on a value we offer. Our recognition as market leader, first class claims, risk management, strong balance sheet, not just price and that matters to a lot of customers. And if I could, I know you asked about property specifically. If I can just call out two places where we've been working really hard with our distribution partners on being clear on risk appetite, building propositions that customers want, building strong opportunity pipeline. That's where we've been getting the growth momentum from, and that's what we will see all through this year. There's too many areas to call out across international, but Global Specialty. A number of new business submissions up 24% year-on-year. Marine absolutely outstanding at 46% increase. Our straight rate on the business, we quote more than 25%. And again, Marine Energy, which Peter talked about earlier, 40% strike rates. So that's more than $700 million of new business in Global Specialty. Just a final one to show that momentum. Our commercial property book another standout. We spent a lot of time fixing and repositioning that portfolio. And we've now seen over the last couple of years, really strong growth and profit. Growth of 11% in the year. We're still seeing strong mid-digit rate rises as well as growth and some real high quality new business. The rating environment today, as Peter said earlier, is different to what it was in Q4. So we see lots of great opportunity all over and we'll build on that momentum.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThat's great, Jon. Thank you. Don, maybe I just want to have a little bit of a highlight of achievements in North America in terms of growth.\n\nDon Bailey - CEO, North America General Insurance (AIG):\nGreat. Thank you, Peter. I'll break down the North American Commercial numbers. For 2024, and you mentioned this, we grew net premiums by 9% driven by retention and our new business. We had strong retention of 91% in retail and 76% in wholesale. We also delivered impressive new business growth like Jon in North America, 15% up on a year-over-year basis and that's on top of 14% new business growth in 2023. This growth is intentional, it's strategic, it's diversified. With the great work over the past few years in our portfolio, we came into 2024 with distribution engagement as a top priority for us in all the channels in which we operate and it's paid off. Our new business was strong through all three channels. Retail, wholesale and alternative. With Lexington, we had another strong year. They represented 48% of our new business.

Peter, I was hoping you could walk us through how we should think about the impact of the artificial intelligence deployed in underwriting? I know it's simplistic to say how many loss ratio points would have moved, but how should we think about it more broadly?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThanks, Meyer, and good morning. For us, I could spend a meaningful amount of time talking about GenAI and we fully intend to do that at Investor Day. Our focus has always been on driving growth certainly there's opportunities in contact centers and call centers and operational capabilities that through large language models, robotics that we will gain efficiencies. But for us, it's all about ingestion of data, getting more qualified data to the underwriters in a fraction of the time. And in order to do that, you need to be very disciplined sort of end-to-end. So how we ingest data from brokers and agents, how we define what data we want in the underwriting criteria when it gets to the underwriter, how do we load that into models and how do we get more data from credible sources that may supplement the underwriters' decision making in order to continue to improve the portfolio. If I use Lexington as an example, in 2017 and 2018, we received 40,000 submissions. This year, it's over 400,000. So it's more complex today than just building out algorithms to get to different industry groups or different classes of business. We want to get more to the underwriters real time. And so we've been doing this for the better part of 18 months. I said we built out a really strong agentic ecosystem with, again, data ingestion with Palantir, building out large language models with Anthropic and using other reliable third parties to help us accelerate the modeling. And so I think it's going to help us propel top line growth by getting more data, getting richer data sets, giving the underwriters more capabilities to underwrite and having it done in the fraction amount of time and doing it at scale.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Thank you. That's very helpful. The second question is on the timeline for getting the high net worth personal lines business to growth underwriting profitability. I don't know if there's anything you can share on that.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYes, absolutely, Meyer. And, look, I think we've been on that journey for a couple of years, and everybody has been patient with the story. We continue to improve the combined ratio. We continue to improve the loss ratio. And if you look at Global Personal, the biggest contributor in terms of that improvement, it was primarily all the private client service or a high net worth business. There was a significant improvement in the loss ratio and we expect that to continue. We have a balanced growth strategy with non-admitted as well as admitted and believe that as we see more submission activity, which we are, not admitted that we're able to deploy our capital with more flexibility to be responsive to client needs. So I'm thinking about structure pricing, the amount of limit that we can put out and it's not only in peak zones, it's in non-peak zones. And so we expect to see that continue to accelerate. We got to scale this year. And so we've renegotiated ceding commissions with PCS and so you'll see a meaningful improvement there, which should translate into overall expense ratio improvement and combined ratio improvement. And last I mentioned is that we have tremendous partners that have joined us based on how we've repositioned the portfolio and our encouraging growth. And so we have a 30% quota share with six participants all have very strong expertise in the high net worth space that are backing us for more growth. So I think we have it all moving in the right direction, attritional loss ratios, cat support from great partners and improvement in expense ratio and you'll see that contribute in 2025 to helping overall Global Personal improve.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, fantastic. Thank you so much."

One is are we at a point where there are aspirational areas of business that AIG is not in that you would be looking for either on organic or inorganic basis? And I guess sort of relatedly on the other side of that question is where are we from a divesting of noncore businesses perspective? Are we pretty much done at this point?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nSure. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the second one first. I think we are largely done. I mean, I don't ever say never or always. But I think we now have the portfolio in a place where we'd like it, certainly on the commercial side, and now having one segment for Global Personal. We know we have work to do, but really like the mix of the portfolio, its global balance and think that we can grow it. In terms of M&A, we're going to remain very disciplined. I always use the word when I get the question on the calls or I'm in front of you. It's around being, it has to be compelling, which just means that it's either going to be a geography that's complementary that actually adds value to AIG and our clients' products that we may not be in that we like and think that it's going to be accretive to ROE and how we grow our business. There are businesses that we have that have scale, but additional scale could be quite compelling. And so we are looking at that businesses that may do that and accelerate. And of course then there's complementary businesses that we may not be in that we think could be very additive to the platform. So we have a very disciplined approach. We always are looking around the world to see if there's things that are additive. But I do want to say I think we're at the size and scale where we don't need to add anything. We are showing, and I think Jon and Don provided tremendous insight as to why we think we can grow the business organically. We have a really strong capital base, which we can grow into, and believe that there's a path there. So I don't think it's an either or. I think we have now set the company up with enormous strategic and financial flexibility. We'll remain very disciplined as we look at inorganic, but we're very excited about the organic opportunities that are in front of us.\n\nJon Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nGreat. Maybe as a second question. Do you have any thoughts on the regulatory environment? Clearly lots of, as my grandmother would say, interesting things happening in California from a regulatory perspective. But broader, do you think there's some changes here that are coming or do you think it's pretty status quo?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nInsurance is complicated because we're regulated state by state. And that makes every state a little bit different, right? And I think the ones that get the attention are going to be ones that have peak zone exposure like we're seeing within California. And California is particularly complicated because I relate it almost to Japan. It's a geography that has two major perils that drive catastrophe results. And so I was in Japan's typhoon quake, California's quake and now wildfire. And but there's regulators. We work very closely with them to try and be helpful and constructive on the changes that have happened in the catastrophe climate, which is looking at modeling, looking at loss cost, looking at cost of goods sold and looking at ways in which we can be more responsive to client needs. And I think that in California, we just saw that the modeling is flawed. It doesn't necessarily always take into account tail events. There's not a lot of model losses north of $40 billion. And so therefore, it becomes very complicated. And I don't mean this in California, but we're now seeing it, which is some of these state set up sort of vehicles that become a market of last resort be sometimes become a market of only resort and then they end up taking on a lot of aggregate. So I think we just need a reset in certain spots. And I think like insurance companies that have technical capabilities working very closely with regulators. I hope that we're going to position the businesses where we will have more flexibility in the future.\n\nJon Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):"

I heard the comments about ceding commissions improving, so that should be a positive going forward. The expense ratio has been running a bit higher than expected for a while now. I mean, obviously, the loss ratio has been excellent. So that's the main focus. But just curious if you're willing to give any specific more specific guidance on kind of what type of expense ratio level or acquisition expense ratio level we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nMichael, are we talking about PCS and high net worth or just general insurance?\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nSorry, I was talking about the whole company, General Insurance.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYes. So let me unpack, I mean, again, I know with AIG, it's like with the divestitures and a lot of the moving pieces from other operations into General Insurance, it's complicated. But I'm actually really pleased with what we've done on the expenses. I think we've remained incredibly disciplined. We focused on a lean parent, which just meant that there's simplicity. There's not a lot of expenses sitting in other operations and they're going to be more in the business. So if I actually take you through what happened, and if you look at our financial supplement, you'll see $2.9 billion or thereabout $2.952 billion as sort of the expenses. But if you get underneath that, look, AIG Next, the business was very proactive in getting expenses out. And so we would have gotten around $125 million to $140 million out through AIG Next. But we've added in from other operations and other technology that would have sat in other operations, almost $200 million. And so the business has absorbed a lot of expenses as we reposition the company to have this lean parent very transparent, not with a lot of expenses and the business is absorbing it as we go. And so not only am I proud that they've been able to do that and we haven't had a blip, we also believe that there's opportunities to get more expenses out and the ratios to improve as we get through the rest of 2025. Do you have a follow-up?\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nYes. Quick follow-up. Just I know you made some comments on the casualty marketplace. I'm not fast enough to update all the pricing data you gave us, which is always helpful. But I'm curious, are you experiencing any acceleration in casualty pricing, either excess or retail? And do you still feel that I feel like a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned this might be an area you're willing to play a bit of offense in.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYes. So it's a great question. And again when we look at rate across North America, International, it's an index. And so you don't always get a line of sight. But we do see real opportunities in casualty. We're very cautious, but the rate environment is actually quite strong. I mean in Lexington Casualty, you'll start there. We had 14% rate in 2024. In retail excess casualty, we had 15%, that's the fifth year in a row of double-digit rate increases in retail excess casualty, it's above loss cost trend. So we feel like we're building margin, really strong retention. We've been able to reposition the portfolio as we've liked. We have an exceptional particularly in the US leadership with Barbara Luck. I mean we have the best underwriting team in the industry and that's being demonstrated because clients are asking us to be on their business, help structure it, help the terms and conditions. So others will be active participants in the market. And so we're leading. We're underwriting really well. We've repositioned the portfolio. We've got great reinsurance support for severity. And we're getting rate above loss cost. So I want to be very cautious and careful, but I also don't want to miss the opportunity to be an industry leader.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):"

Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with US GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to net premiums written and net premiums earned are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 26 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2025 financial results. AIG's overall performance in the quarter was exceptional and we continued to make significant progress on our strategic, operational and financial objectives. We had a very busy start to the year. And while it's hard to believe, just 30 days ago, we hosted our Investor Day. We're incredibly grateful for the positive engagement and support from our colleagues and many stakeholders and appreciated the opportunity to share our journey with them. For my prepared remarks, I will start with an overview of our Investor Day, including what we intend to achieve, some observations from the meeting, and what we've learned since. Second, I will highlight our first quarter financial results. Third, I want to provide a spotlight on our business strategy and long-term view of India, a business that we briefly touched on at our Investor Day. Fourth, given the widespread interest, I will offer a few observations on the impact of tariffs. And last, I'll provide an update on our progress toward our financial targets that we outlined at our Investor Day. Keith will then provide more detail on our financial results, and Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Beginning with Investor Day, our objective was to demonstrate the incredible progress the company has made over the last seven years and why we believe we're so well-positioned for the future. We shared how we established an underwriting culture of excellence, substantially reduced underwriting exposure, controlled volatility, structured the company for the future, refreshed our purpose and values, developed a world-class end-to-end operating structure, digitized end-to-end processes, developed a robust data hierarchy, and retired over 1,200 applications while migrating to the cloud. We discussed how we created a lean parent company and strengthened our balance sheet while executing a disciplined capital management strategy, which will enable AIG to have maximum strategic and financial flexibility for the future. We provided detail on our strategy to deploy GenAI end-to-end, and to demonstrate how the advancement in adoption is making a difference across our business to drive future growth, and that was on full display. I'm very grateful to our world-class partners, Alex Karp of Palantir and Dario Amodei of Anthropic, for joining Sara Eisen and me on stage to showcase and validate our strategy. And while they are very entertaining guests and have better things to do with their time than show up at AIG's Investor Day, they felt compelled to speak to our stakeholders about how they fully endorse AIG's strategy. It was a very important moment for our company. We demonstrated the breadth and depth of our global portfolio with $24 billion of net premiums written, which enables us to leverage both our diverse geographic footprint and strong product offerings to solve our clients' risk needs. We highlighted what a thoughtful and carefully planned reinsurance strategy can do for company over time, showcasing key structures of our portfolio and providing an introduction to our special purpose vehicle backed by Blackstone, which is an important part of our strategic evolution. Our stakeholders came away from the event with a much clearer understanding of our strategic direction, the deep expertise within our company, our differentiated approach to GenAI and our ambitious yet achievable financial targets and global growth opportunities. Inside the company, there's a sense of confidence and pride. Our Investor Day gave our colleagues the opportunity to see their hard work recognized in an impactful way, which has generated energy and engagement across the organization and we're excited to take this momentum forward. If I had to choose just one key takeaway from our Investor Day, it is that AIG is in every way a different company. Turning to our financial results, against the challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we made excellent progress towards our long-term strategic and financial goals, while delivering exceptional underwriting results, effectively manage volatility, while reducing expenses. In the first quarter, adjusted after-tax income was $702 million or $1.17 per diluted share. Building on our momentum, we had another quarter of strong premium growth. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year on a comparable basis, led by 10% growth in Global Commercial. North America Commercial Insurance net premiums written grew 14% year-over-year. Lexington grew 23%, led by Lexington Casualty, which grew 27%. It's worth noting that Lexington submission growth continued in the first quarter, increasing 30% year-over-year, and that is following an increase of over 50% in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to 2023. Simply an outstanding result. This increase in submission activity was primarily driven by middle market casualty and property, which together represents two-thirds of the total submissions received. Glatfelter contributed 16% growth and Retail Property grew over 40%, almost entirely driven by the significant enhancements to our reinsurance structures. International Commercial Insurance net premiums written grew 8% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by property at 35%, largely as a result of enhanced reinsurance structures. And Marine grew an impressive 17%. Turning to expenses, our general insurance expense ratio decreased to 30.5% in the first quarter compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. The divestiture of our travel business was the largest contributor to this improvement, accounting for 110 basis points. The remaining 20 basis points of improvement came from AIG Next initiatives. This is very impressive when you consider that General Insurance absorbed $78 million of additional expenses that were booked "

      "raw_bytes": " remaining 20 basis points of improvement came from AIG Next initiatives. This is very impressive when you consider that General Insurance absorbed $78 million of additional expenses that were booked in Other Operations in 2024. Other Operations general operating expenses were $85 million in the quarter. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 87.8%, the best first quarter result for AIG since the financial crisis. The prior year quarter was 88.4%. The calendar year combined ratio was 95.8% for the quarter, which included $520 million in catastrophe losses, driven by the California wildfires, which came in at $460 million. The combined ratio represented 9.1 loss ratio points and is a testament to our strategy for managing volatility. While industry losses from natural catastrophes are the second highest for the first quarter of the year on record, we expect our net retained catastrophe losses to be within expectations for 2025, largely based on our reinsurance structures. If you apply our current loss projections for the wildfire catastrophe to our aggregate cover, we will have approximately $35 million net of annual aggregate deductible remaining for all other perils in North America, excluding wind and earthquake, and approximately $385 million net left for all perils, both subject to a $50 million each and every loss deductible for the rest of this calendar year. We also continue to have significant property catastrophe occurrence limit available. Overall, the market remained favorable in the first quarter, particularly in segments with very good underlying fundamentals. Keith is going to cover rate in more detail in his remarks, but I wanted to provide some perspective. For North America, the rate increases in the quarter were led by excess casualty at 16%. In the last five calendar years, excess casualty has had double-digit rate increases each year with cumulative rate above loss trend. Gladfelter had a 6% rate increase. These increases were offset by Financial Lines, which decreased 5%, Retail Property, which decreased 7%, and Lexington Property, which decreased 10%. In Financial Lines, we have the benefit of a highly diversified business by product and segment. This enables us to position the portfolio for the best risk-adjusted returns even in a competitive market. To further outline, we have meaningfully reduced our excess capacity, where pricing is increasingly commoditized. We're focused on our primary business where we have a differentiated offering and a leadership position. Our Financial Lines portfolio has gone from representing 30% of North America Commercial net premiums written in 2021 to representing 19% of the portfolio today. Next, let me give some context on property rate. Over the past five years, we have had cumulative rate increases of 113% in Retail Property and 96% in Wholesale Property. Pricing continues to be above our technical view, nonetheless, we continue to be very disciplined and we'll monitor market conditions throughout the year. In International, the environment was more balanced. Casualty had a 7% rate increase, Property had a 2% rate increase, offset by Global Specialty and Talbot, which decreased 1% and 4%, respectively, and Financial Lines, which decreased by 3%. And please recall that we report rate on gross premiums written. And because many of our lines are heavily impacted by reinsurance in the first quarter, there's not a direct correlation to net premiums written, which are lower in certain businesses, such as our Global Specialty business. Turning to capital management, we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter. This included $2.2 billion of share repurchases and $234 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 17.1% and parent liquidity of $4.9 billion. As I announced on Investor Day, as of April 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $7.5 billion, inclusive of the outstanding authorization amount, of which approximately $7.1 billion remains available. Additionally, the Board approved a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share yesterday. We expect to repurchase a total of $5 billion to $6 billion of shares in 2025, subject to share price and market conditions, which should bring us to a range of 500 million to 550 million shares outstanding over time. Now, I'd like to transition to discuss one of our strategic partnerships. While we covered a lot of content on Investor Day, one part of our business that we did not address in any detail is Tata AIG. With this in mind, I'd like to share some observations on the rapidly growing market in India and insights about our joint venture with the Tata Group. India as a country has made remarkable progress over the last decade. Over that time, the economy has grown from the 10th largest to the 5th largest economy in the world and is likely to become the third largest economy after the United States and China by 2030. Real GDP is estimated to grow approximately 7% over the next two years with nominal GDP growing nearly two times higher. The changing demographics in India are well known, but worth highlighting. In a country of nearly 1.5 billion people, half of the population is below the age of 30. The middle-class is projected to more than double by 2030 with some of the fastest growth happening in Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities. Pivoting to the insurance industry, the general insurance market in India is over $35 billion in gross premiums written as of 2023 and had a compound annual growth rate of around 11% over the last five years. We expect the market will sustain this type of growth through 2030. And there's a massive opportunity for growth, given the changing dynamics. In India, non-life insurance penetration is still relatively low at 1% of GDP. In contrast, the United States is at 9% of GDP. Our presence in India began 25 years ago when we partnered with Tata Group to establish a joint venture, Tata AIG. The India insurance market opened to private insurance companies and direct foreign investment in 2000. At the time, the maximum allowable foreign investment was 26%, which is what we currently hold today. Prior to 2000, India's insurance market was dominated by public sector insurance companies, which had 100% market share. Opening up the market to private insurance and foreign direct investment dramatically shifted India's insurance landscape. Today, private sector insurance companies represent 60% of the non-life market. While India offers tremendous opportunity, it's a complex and highly competitive market. For foreign companies, it's important to choose the right partner, a company with deep and broad knowledge of India and one with a strong reputation. For AIG, there is no better choice than Tata Group, one of the highest quality global companies. Tata Group operates 30 companies in over 100 countries across diverse industries. Its 26 publicly listed enterprises have a combined market cap of $365 billion with over 1 million employees. Over the last decade, Tata Group has been consistently ranked as one of India's most valuable brands. Tata AIG is highly respected and is ranked as the #2 private insurer in the commercial insurance and motor insurance sectors. It serves 27 million customers with 8,500 employees and leverages 85,000 captive agents operating across the country.

The business has exceptional technology and data capabilities that enabled it to scale rapidly and support the continued ambition for accelerated growth. Tata AIG's products and services are digital-first with clients and agents enabled by technology at every stage of the value chain, providing a complete digital customer experience, which is what clients in India expect. Additionally, Tata AIG benefits from access to AIG's multinational network with AIG supporting the joint venture's domestic multinational corporate clients. In close partnership with Tata Group, we're prepared to significantly invest in growth organically and possibly inorganically, should opportunities present themselves. And I expect this business to continue to scale faster than any other geography in our portfolio. There's been a lot of discussion about tariffs and I'd like to share a perspective, understanding that there is still significant uncertainty around the topic of tariffs. To start, let me provide some relevant facts. First, there are only seven countries worldwide that export more than $100 billion to the United States. And China, Canada and Mexico are the only countries that export over $250 billion. When looking at a country's level of exports to the United States as a percentage of their total exports, Mexico is 79%, Canada is 74% and China is less than 20%. Altogether, tariffs create uncertainty, which may lead to lower levels of transactional activity in the near term, impacting certain commercial businesses, but it's premature to predict any specific outcomes related to these emerging macro trends. The greatest challenge for companies is understanding the real impact of tariffs and how they are changing and their implications. There is a complexity not only with tariff policies evolving, but also with the potential impact on supply chains. It's also important to consider the implications to loss costs and inflation. To help parse through this complexity, let me share a property example. Typically, in a high net worth claim and, of course, it's subject to the particular type of loss, approximately 60% of the loss would be for rebuilding costs, 30% for content and 10% or thereabouts for allocated loss adjustment expense. When considering materials, such as lumber, floor coverings, windows, steel, marble or granite, you need to take into account increased inflation rates. Then, you should consider which of these items are imported. For example, Canada represents roughly 85% of all US softwood lumber imports. This added dimension further complicates the calculation of future loss costs. Additionally, if there's another major catastrophe in 2025 beyond the January wildfires, we could see demand surge, supply constraints and further inflation, which may also lead to extended business interruption. Lastly, insurance companies need to monitor the effects of sales, payroll and other factors to calculate the potential impact on future premiums, if any. We will continue to monitor the implications for our business as more information becomes available. Before I close, I want to touch on the financial targets that we announced on Investor Day. These are multi-year goals, so I'm not going to give updates every quarter, but I did want to provide some insight. Operating EPS is on track, and the key drivers for earnings growth remain favorable. We produced strong top-line growth and managed volatility in a very heavy catastrophe quarter. We are on our way to fully replacing Corebridge earnings by 2026 and we expect to achieve a 20%-plus earnings per share compound annual growth rate over the next three years. We continue to make progress towards our goal of achieving 10% to 13% core operating ROE. Our first quarter core operating ROE was 7.7%, which was impacted by catastrophe losses. We expect to meet our 2025 objective of a 10%-plus core operating ROE as we outlined on Investor Day. We've made terrific progress towards our goal of achieving an expense ratio below 30% for General Insurance with the first quarter coming in at 30.5%. We will continue our significant focus to maintain an expense structure that aligns with the size of the company that we are while investing in our data and digital strategies. And finally, turning to our dividend, we announced our intent at Investor Day to grow the dividend per share by 10%-plus in 2025 and 2026. Yesterday, the AIG Board of Directors approved a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share starting in the second quarter of 2025. In summary, we've entered an exciting new chapter for AIG and we're executing on all aspects of our strategy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. Starting with General Insurance, overall results were strong and reflected excellent underwriting and disciplined expense management. Adjusted pre-tax income, or APTI, was $979 million, a decrease of $379 million from the prior year quarter, due to higher catastrophe losses, primarily related to the California wildfires. Underwriting income was $243 million, down $353 million from the prior year quarter. Results reflect higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior year development and continued improvement in accident year underwriting. First quarter General Insurance gross premiums written were $9 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year, and net premiums written were $4.5 billion, an 8% increase. General Insurance combined ratio was 95.8% compared to 89.8% in the prior year quarter and included 9.1 points of CAT losses versus 1.9 points in the first quarter of 2024. Prior year development net of reinsurance was $64 million favorable, up from $22 million favorable in the prior year. This quarter included $31 million of ADC amortization and $33 million of favorable development, largely related to favorable actual versus expected loss experience in the US Property and Global Specialty lines. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, the ADC amortization is expected to be approximately $31 million each quarter compared to $34 million a quarter in 2024. Our Global Commercial business had a terrific start to the year. Net premiums written grew 10%. We produced a combined ratio of 91.2% despite elevated CAT activity, and our expense ratio improved 40 basis points from the prior year quarter, an excellent result. North America commercial calendar year combined ratio was 93.9%, which included 12 points of CATs. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 84.3%, an improvement of 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2024. The expense ratio declined a full 2 points, driven by a combination of AIG Next benefits and increased operating leverage, partially offset by higher corporate expense allocations, as the company implemented its lean parent structure. The accident year loss ratio was 62.2% for the quarter, a 40 basis point increase year-over-year due to changes in business mix. Turning to International Commercial. The calendar year combined ratio was 88.2%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of a sub-90% combined ratio, an outstanding result. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 85.4%, which increased 240 basis points year-over-year. This was primarily driven by a 130 basis point increase in the expense ratio as a result of lean parent allocations. The accident year loss ratio was 54.6%, a 110 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting business mix and increased operating costs from lean parent implementation. Turning to Global Personal. The combined ratio was 107.9%, while the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 95.6%. Excluding the divested travel business, the accident year combined ratio improved 110 basis points, owing to a 190 basis po"

Excluding the divested travel business, the accident year combined ratio improved 110 basis points, owing to a 190 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio. This was driven by underlying improvement in our US high-net-worth book, benefiting from a combination of rate over trend, business mix and underwriting actions. This was partially offset by a 70 basis point increase in our acquisition ratio, which we expect to unwind and improve over the course of 2025 as reinsurance and improved commission terms with PCS earn through. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to drive financial performance in Global Personal by improving the combined ratio by 500 basis points over the next three years towards our 94% target. Moving to rates, where Peter already provided some perspective. For the first quarter, excluding workers' compensation and Financial Lines, Global Commercial line's pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 4%. In North America Commercial, renewal rate increased 1% year-over-year. If you exclude workers' compensation and Financial Lines, renewal rate was up 2% with overall pricing up 4% year-over-year. In International Commercial, overall pricing was up 2% or up 4% excluding Financial Lines. This is an improvement versus the fourth quarter, where pricing was flat. While International Commercial overall pricing is slightly below loss cost trend, excluding Financial Lines, pricing and loss cost trend are roughly in line. Moving to Other Operations. First quarter adjusted pre-tax loss was $70 million, a significant improvement versus the prior year quarter of $205 million, reflecting substantially lower general operating expense, higher net investment income and lower interest expense. As Peter mentioned, we have achieved our Other Operations run-rate GOE target at $85 million in the first quarter and are on track for $350 million of annual expenses in 2025. We are now a much simpler company with a lean parent corporate structure that supports our three operating segments. Turning now to investment income. Our investment portfolio is high-quality and well-diversified with durations that are closely matched to our liability profile. It's predominantly comprised of investment grade fixed maturity securities, helping to minimize exposure to short-term market swings. First quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $845 million, an increase of $4 million year-over-year. Net investment income is comprised of two categories: our core portfolio, which sits in General Insurance and income from parent liquidity and Corebridge dividends, which sits in Other Operations. First, on General Insurance. Net investment income was $736 million, down $26 million or 3% year-over-year, owing to lower income from other invested assets and alternative investments, partially offset by higher income from the fixed maturity portfolio, as we benefit from improved reinvestment rates. Other invested assets had a loss of $18 million compared to income of $38 million in the first quarter 2024. One variable worth noting is how we account for our joint venture with Tata Group. We include 26% of Tata AIG's net income in other invested assets, which also includes mark-to-market changes in their investment portfolio, which reflects capital market movements in India. It is reported under the equity accounting method with a one quarter lag. Based on our current view, we expect General Insurance total net investment income to be up modestly in the second quarter versus the $736 million in the first quarter. The gains in the fixed maturity and loan portfolio are likely to be offset by lower income from other invested assets and alternative investments. During the first quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was 4.56%, roughly 135 basis points higher than sales and maturities in the quarter. The annualized yield excluding calls and prepayments was 4.11%, a 24 basis point increase year-over-year or 19 basis points sequentially. Turning to Other Operations. Net investment income was $108 million, consisting of income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $77 million and Corebridge dividend income of $31 million. Considering current interest rates and lower liquidity balances as we repurchase shares, we expect income from our parent liquidity portfolio to be around $50 million in the second quarter, subject to market conditions. Turning to tax. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.8%, which included a net benefit from discrete items. As we stated on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in line with the full year 2024 level with slight variations quarter to quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to have strong financial flexibility. We believe this positions us well to execute on our strategic priorities while navigating evolving market conditions. Book value per share was $71.38 at quarter-end, up 10% from March 31, 2024, mainly due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $67.96, down 8% from March 31, 2024, primarily due to the impact of the Corebridge deconsolidation. At the end of the first quarter, we had a debt to total capital ratio of 17.1%. In conclusion, we had a strong first quarter. We expect to deliver on our target of 10%-plus core operating ROE in 2025, while making steady progress on the financial targets we outlined at our Investor Day. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready for questions. Thank you."

I have a -- maybe a high-level question on kind of the transformation to using GenAI, et cetera. I've got a lot of questions post Investor Day on it that I'm hoping you can help out with. So, would -- I'm just kind of curious like the process for an insurer to transform using AI. Is there a high cost of entry? Does it take a long time to get your data on the right form to be able to adopt? And maybe you can kind of just talk to whether -- what you're doing is table stakes or you feel you're a first-mover or fast follower, just kind of any -- it's tough in our seats to really kind of at this stage understand kind of what it takes to do what you're doing, which doesn't seem easy.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nSure, Mike. Thanks for the question. A few things. One is, we've been working on this for a couple of years and it all started with a foundation of what we did with AIG 200 of having terrific end-to-end process, starting to digitize all of our workflows, getting data quality and data integrity, which enabled us to start to adopt an end-to-end process that was going to enable GenAI to accelerate underwriting and how we were going to be able to assess risks. And so, we began this process, as I said, with pilots. They are no longer pilots. I think that's something I want to be very clear. We're actually going live on a couple of our lines of business. And we continue to evolve with some of the partners that we brought to Investor Day, whether it's Palantir in terms of data ingestion, of accelerating not only the quality of data but the quantity and the speed and being able to utilize large language models to recognize data patterns and recognize risk selection criteria, and our underwriters are enabled to get more information. And so, this has been something that has been highly strategic for us. We're highly committed to it. I don't know where other insurance companies are. My understanding is this is a little bit of a different way of doing it. We think it's the best-in-class way of doing it. I think it was validated by Alex and Dario, and it takes an entire organization to really buy into, the way in which we're going to do this end-to-end and believe that we are going to have the impact that we outlined on Investor Day over time, which is just to decrease cycle time, have higher-quality data and information and empower the underwriters to make decisions.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nThat's helpful. My quick follow-up is, thanks for the market commentary. I wasn't sure if you gave us North America Commercial pricing metrics. Some of the competitors have talked about kind of seeing a decline in property, which has caused pricing to move down a bit as well. Is that accurate for AIG as well?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nWell, I'm going to have Don and Jon comment because I think it's a really important question, Mike. And what I would say on pricing, as always, is that, overall, a lot of times, the index doesn't really tell the story. We know that in North America, in property, we had some headwinds. And we outlined those in my prepared remarks, but still believe that the technical pricing is very strong for very good returns, and we produced those in the quarter on an underlying basis across the world. We've gotten cumulative rate increases that are substantial. You also have to take into account for us, we are a big buyer of reinsurance because we believe in that sort of cost of goods sold approach, which is we have the embedded pricing into our product, and therefore, we know what CAT is going to cost, what risk is going to cost. Our property reinsurance risk-adjusted reductions are greater than what we're seeing on the retail side. I think that's an important point. Our submission count, flight to quality, is really important. And I would also say, and I think that based on my background, I have some credibility and context in this is that when brokers are talking about what's happening in the market, they're talking about the market. And that means they're talking about a lot of insurance companies, a lot of different parts of segmentation, and then, that becomes an index as well. My view is that not all insurance companies are created equal. So, like, if you're leading, if you're setting terms, if you're pricing, you tend to have a little bit of a different outcome. And I think that we've seen that with AIG based on our retention, based on new business, based on what we believe is a flight to quality. So, I'm going to turn it over to Don now, but, again, you have to look at also our casualty was very strong, continues to be very strong after multiple years of very strong rate increases. We saw stronger rate increases in the large account than we did in the mid-market, but all casualty on an excess basis, we saw above loss cost. So, we're seeing some very positive trends in casualty. We see some opportunities for growth. We saw that in Lexington. International is a little bit more orderly, and I'll have Jon highlight that. We saw a little bit of a headwind in pricing in specialty, but that business is performing at an exceptional level. Don, do you want to put it -- I probably answered the question for you, but, like, if maybe you can just give a little bit more context in North America.\n\nDon Bailey - Global Head of Distribution and Field Operations (or similar senior executive) (AIG):\nSure, Peter. Absolutely. So, as you highlighted, Peter, in your commentary, we had some very strong rate in some areas of the North American Commercial segment and definitely had some pressure in other areas. You covered a lot of that in your prepared comments and some of the comments you just offered there. But more line by line, Mike, which I can offer you too, casually, the rate, it continues to be very strong and is in excess of loss trends. We'd also say that it's probably picking up some momentum as well. In excess, we're seeing better rate in the large accounts than we are in the middle market and small. Peter just mentioned that. We've got some data now that tracks that absolutely validates that. Programs in Glatfelter are worth noting as well. Those continue to be rate positive. Again, both program businesses for us, affinity-driven, generally experienced less rate volatility than the rest of our portfolio. We've got highly-engaged distribution partners there, and there are significant growth opportunities in that space. Financial Lines, continues to be down mid-single-digits. So, the good news is we're making an adequate return on the book. Regarding public D&O rate trends, again, if you're looking for some good news, if you look at our quarter, January from a rate standpoint was the worst. March was improved, and we have some early signs that April indicates even more continued improvement. Finally, I'll just say on property, we have had cumulative rate increases over the years. We're seeing some pressure on both retail and wholesale. We'll currently look at this as the year plays out, but we're -- pricing remains above technical, which is great, but we need to see how the rest of the year is going to play out. But overall, we're really pleased with the long tail lines, Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThat's great, Don. Thanks. Jon, do you want to make some comments on international rate?\n\nJon Hancock - Chief Executive Officer, International General Insurance (AIG):\nYeah. Well, you and Keith have covered a lot of this. Well, I'll repeat some of what I've said at Investor Day. We have a huge advantage on the diversity of our portfolio products, distribution, geography across the whole of international. So, we have a huge hunting ground and opportunity to divert time, resource and capital into the most attractive areas and away from the others. And th"

So, we have a huge hunting ground and opportunity to divert time, resource and capital into the most attractive areas and away from the others. And that's what we're doing right now and always do, and especially as market dynamics are not the same everywhere at the same time. Now, I'd also say, Peter, you and Keith have both said this, we've got total confidence in the portfolio, the quality, the price, the loss picks, the reserves. We've got that cumulative rate rise you've been talking about with more than price adequate in every portfolio. And you can see that in the results every quarter. And our standards haven't changed, so this market is very orderly for us. Similar trends to Don and different nuances, property rate is still positive, and it's about loss trend. And our retentions are high, and we're growing. I don't think we're giving away margin and we watch that relentlessly. But the combined ratios that we deliver in International Properly -- property, that's some of the best I've seen in my career. So, we start from a very, very strong place. Like with Don here, Financial Lines is under pressure, less pressure than it was, but still under pricing pressure, but that's mainly on D&O in certain markets, not on everything, anywhere. So, our fin lines book has shrunk a bit, and our D&O book has shrunk more. But other parts of the portfolio under much less pressure, so we've got stronger retention there. Casualty varies by region, overall, very rate positive and high retention. And I will call out, and I know you've mentioned Global Specialty and Talbot, there is some rate pressure in some places, but we talked about this on Investor Day and we put some slides up on Investor Day. Those businesses are producing exceptional results quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out. Yes, Marine is still getting really good rate. We're seeing strong growth. The other class, say, there's some pressure, but we're leaders on a lot of that business in the subscription markets in specialty and Talbot. So, we work with clients to achieve sensible and sustainable terms. And where we do follow in that subscription market, much as we won't leave the market down, we won't follow it down there either.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYeah. That's great, Jon.

In the interim, what, I guess, underwriting pricing policy administration efforts need to happen just to reflect that uncertainty as you sort of sign contracts that are going to expose you to this risk over the next 12 months?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nThanks for the question, Meyer. There's a couple of things. One is looking at the inflation factors within lines of business that we think will be impacted, certainly, property, we tried to outline that in my prepared remarks, you could have catastrophe losses that have been modeled that will be significantly more depending on what happens with supply and also density and also sort of size of loss. So, there's so many different variables. I think looking at each of the loss cost inputs is going to be really important. An example, if I could just expand a little bit, which is what you saw really in the international loss ratio this quarter is that we're cautious and we saw the loss ratio published increase a little bit, but none of the underlying loss ratios deteriorated. We saw one side fact was that we, part of AIG Next, had unallocated loss adjustment expense that found its way into the International business that used to sit in Other Operations. But we also looked at our best estimates, no underlying loss ratio deterioration happened in the International portfolio, but we built a little bit of risk margin in International to deal with the uncertainty that could be in front of us with sort of different lines of business. And so, we are cautious. We've done this in the past where we feel very good about loss ratios, very good about margin, but we may put a little bit more margin for lines of business that we think could be potentially impacted. So, this is something that is evolving daily. What lines of business, what part of the world changes quite a bit, and we're going to be on our front foot in terms of being proactive and making sure that we have the appropriate loss cost and margin built into our pricing.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, fantastic. That's very helpful. Second question, from a modeling perspective, should the remaining quarters in 2025 have the same impact of expenses moving from other operations to the GI segments?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nSo, here's how I would look at it. One is like AIG Next was taking a company that was a conglomerate and simplifying the business by getting the overall organization and culture weave together, and we've accomplished that. So that that was excellent. Two is, we gave significant guidance in terms of the expenses we felt we needed to take out of the company to have a lean operating model. We call it lean parent, but it's got to be a lean company. And so, how we look at the overall expenses are really important. And I think we overachieved because the guidance we gave was, by the end of '25, we should be done with AIG Next. And you can see in Other Operations, GOE, we got there. I mean, like, we are in a place where we've accelerated our progress and feel very pleased with it. I would have expected -- it didn't happen, but I would have expected to see the businesses' expense ratios go up as they will absorb the cost, but they did a phenomenal job of taking out expenses and being proactive as more allocations and more cost came into the business that they had a straight line, ability to not really increase expenses. Now, North America benefited more from AIG Next than international did, and because of the number of countries we're in and you're thinking about IT expenses and legal expenses and other expenses to build a proper global company, more of those allocations were went into international than went into North America. So, international would have had two variables that were kind of moving against it, which is what's reflecting this GOE ratio. But I would expect over the full year -- I could have just answered your question with this sentence, but I thought I'd give you some context, is that, I wouldn't straight line it, but I would think that the expenses you saw in the first quarter ought to be what the year will look like in terms of overall GOE expense in the business.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That is perfectly helpful, and I really appreciate that context. Thank you."

And just does it change the way you'd approach the M&A environment and just the deployment of all this capital that you have available to you?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nI don't think it changes anything, Alex. Thanks for the question. We still remain very disciplined, still looking at the medium to long term for acquisitions. Is it additive to AIG? Is it additive to the company that we may acquire? Looking at the different geographies, different product lines. I think -- and we mentioned also like GenAI and investments and scale and being able to move businesses forward. It gives us great opportunities to look across the world and to see if there's going to be an acquisition that would be additive to AIG. Now, yes, we are in a world of uncertainty, but we've done so much hard work over the past three years on the capital structure side that we have low leverage, cash and we have ample, if not, slightly excess capital in our subsidiaries to grow into. And we still have ownership of Corebridge that we can pull for additional liquidity in the event that we see an acquisition. But we're going to be very careful, we'll be very cautious, and it's not something that needs to be done today. And quite frankly, I said this at Investor Day, if we go through a period of time, which I'm not going to define, that we don't see opportunities that we think are additive to AIG and our shareholders, we'll return the capital to shareholders. But right now, I think it's actually -- some of this uncertainty may actually create opportunities.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. That's helpful. The second question I had for you is just on the mix shift. From the outside, it's difficult at times to model things like mix shifts. And I think the catastrophe budget, in particular, has come down massively and I guess we'll continue to as you do this mix shift in North America Commercial in particular. So, I know you already gave us some help by quantifying some of these things. I think, based on some of the disclosures you gave earlier, we might even be able to back into a cap budget. But I was hoping maybe you could just help us understand that mix shift, how should we think about the impact on underlying versus all-in combined ratio.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nFirst quarter is hard because of property. And it's when we do our catastrophes, it's a net premium written. I think in the past, what's happened is you could even have negative net premium just based on your seeding out more on an NPW basis than what you'd be writing in the quarter. I think that will start to sort of level out. We don't have a lot of catastrophe purchased within the second, third or fourth quarter. I think we're talking about mix of business. Look, the current environment of property in North America, because International is doing just fine, posting tremendous combined ratios, showing some small growth. But if we saw in the first quarter, that would continue, we are going to reduce our gross writings in property and the market will come back to us. I mean, we haven't even entered CAT season yet. So, I'd like to, as I always say, declare about property at the end of the year, not before CAT season. But I think what's reflected really in the reinsurance is just that the AIG in the past would probably have to pay a little bit more because of the quality of data, the quality of the portfolio. We've been moving forward with that over multiple years and I think that's what was reflected in 2025. The mix of business when we reference it, so property remains slight growth on an underlying basis and we're moving more casualty business into the portfolio of the net premium written. Those -- the combined ratios and the loss ratios are higher. So, I think that's really what we're trying to signal is that we had a tremendous growth in Lexington mid-market casualty, but that loss ratio will be higher than what we would expect for property attritional. And so, as that mix changes, you can see the loss ratios reflect that. That's what we're really referencing.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

Is there an opportunity to take more business net here?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYes, there is. I don't think we would want to, though, because how we look at Property CAT, it is a global risk appetite volatility that we're willing to take. And I think what I referenced, and when the script comes out, like we should read it again, how low nets we have going forward in North America Property, because we buy occurrence in aggregate and the volatility is massively reduced for AIG over the course of four quarters. And so, we like that volatility reduction. We like it priced into the business. And then on Casualty, I know it was probably a massive eye chart at Investor Day with the amount of reinstatements we have and what does the vertical limits do. We don't buy a lot of proportional reinsurance in North America on Casualty. We buy excess of loss. And I think in this environment with large jury verdicts, vertical exposures, I don't think it's prudent to take any more net there. And so, I think we feel really comfortable with the reinsurance structure that we have in North America. And as you pointed out, the combined ratios have improved dramatically and really like the core fundamentals of the business the way it is today.\n\nAndrew Anderson - Analyst (Jefferies):\nThank you. And then just on North America Commercial, ex comp, ex Financial Lines pricing, 4% RPC. I guess that's on a gross basis, perhaps a little bit better net. I guess, where I'm going with this is, I would think that's below loss trend, but perhaps with terms and conditions and maybe some mix shift, it sounds like in your commentary you're not really thinking of underlying loss ratio deterioration here.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nNo, I'm not. I mean, as I said, it's really being driven more by property. Property was a big negative on the weighted average. But on the other lines of business, again, we're going to watch financial lines. Don had some really good comments on that. Casualties above loss trend. Gladfelter, as we look across the portfolio, it was really just property that was below loss trend and we'll see how that plays out, but are confident that it's above our technical and also that it's not sustainable to have these type of rate decreases over a long period of time. So, we'd end up pulling back in the event that it stayed that way. But submission count is great. I think there's a lot of opportunities. Retention is good and we still think that the property line for us is going to perform very strong. And just one other data point is that in the first quarter, our International Property is as big as our North America Property. And so, I just want to make sure that we remember that, overall, we have opportunities -- if North America becomes aggressive, we have a lot of points of entry in property and the risk-adjusted returns in International are just fantastic and we'll continue to grow there. But...\n\nAndrew Anderson - Analyst (Jefferies):"

Is it possible to get maybe what gross written premiums growth was there? Just try to understand the impact of the ceded reinsurance on the growth rate. Just kind of thinking about how sustainable is that growth in the near term that you saw in North America Commercial?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYeah. So, Brian, the first quarter was benefited from some reinsurance on property. And I think that the growth would be largely reflecting the net, absent property that I mentioned. So, the casualty for Lexington is very close to what it would be on the net. When we had identified -- when we talked about Glatfelter, Glatfelter benefited a little bit from some of the reinsurance, but still had a very strong growth, as did our program business. Don outlined programs at great length at Investor Day. We're doing less programs. We've taken the best practices of Glatfelter and built it out. But I would say those largely, the gross and the nets, were not too far off. It was just really property that benefited. What I just wanted to signal is that you see sort of the rate environment and why you're growing in property, well, we really aren't growing on the gross. As a matter of fact, in Lexington Property, in the gross we contracted, and retail gross slight increase, but the net was really more reflective of the reinsurance on property. Do you want to say something, Don?\n\nDon Bailey - Global Head of Distribution and Field Operations (or similar senior executive) (AIG):\nI would just validate that, yeah, the underlying portfolio is strong, it's double-digits on a net basis.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. So, nothing unusual in the first quarter? I mean, this is good solid growth you're seeing is sustainable here for at least in the near term, unless, of course, some other property competitor or something else comes up?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nYeah. I think, look, you probably won't see the same property effect in the future because we're not going to have as much reinsurance. So, I think those nets will come down. But the rest of the portfolio should reflect, as Don said, really strong new business, strong retention. We'll watch each line of business and make sure we're growing where we want to grow, but still think there's growth opportunities.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. And then, one last one, Peter. Any updated thoughts on what casualty loss trend is looking like here? A couple of positive developments, I think in Georgia and some areas as far as legislation goes. Maybe thoughts on that?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & CEO (AIG):\nWe'll watch it, Brian. We have not adjusted any of our loss costs and inflation factors on casualty, and we'll probably look at it in the sort of mid-year, but so far, we're keeping it where it was.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG has no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to net premiums written are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Page 25 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Quentin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2025 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Jon Hancock and Don Bailey will join us for the Q&A portion of our call. AIG had an outstanding second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic, operational and financial objectives that we outlined at Investor Day. Our momentum continues to build with strong performance across the board. We delivered adjusted after-tax income per diluted share of $1.81, an increase of 56% year-over-year. Adjusted after-tax income for the quarter was $1 billion an increase of 35% from the prior year quarter, driven by our general insurance business, which had underwriting income of $626 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year. Net investment income on an adjusted pretax basis was $955 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.4%. Calendar year combined ratio was 89.3%, an improvement of 320 basis points from the prior year quarter. We achieved a core operating ROE of 11.7%. We returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.5 billion. We sold $430 million or 13.4 million shares of Corebridge Financial, reducing our stake to approximately 21%. And finally, both S&P Global and Moody's upgraded their financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance subsidiaries during the quarter, which was a major milestone. This is our first upgrade from S&P Global since 2013 and our first upgrade from Moody's since 1990. For our call this morning, I will share a detailed review of our second quarter results, a few observations on the global property market and specifically our portfolio, highlights from our successful completion of AIG Next, which delivered $500 million in savings and significant operational improvements, an overview of Russia aviation-related claims, and an update on our Gen AI initiatives. Before I review the quarter in more detail, I'd like to take a moment to welcome John Neal to AIG, who will be joining us as President on December 1. As many of you know, John is one of the most accomplished executives in our industry. He's very well known to our stakeholders, has significant global operating experience and an impressive track record leading underwriting organizations most recently as the CEO of Lloyd's London. John will oversee our General Insurance organization and will partner with me and the business leaders in driving the strategic direction of the business. John's background, experience and global expertise adds depth to our excellent management team, and we look forward to working closely with them in his new role. Now let me provide a more detailed view of our second quarter financial results. Net premiums written were $6.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. This included 3% growth in Global Commercial. North America Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 4% year-over-year. Excluding Property, which I will discuss in more detail, North America Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 11%. We had growth in businesses that we believe have strong risk-adjusted margins, and we tempered growth in those businesses that had rate pressure. Retail Casualty and Lexington Casualty each increased 19%. Western World increased 15% and our alternative businesses, which consist of Glatfelter and programs, also increased 19%. These results were offset by Retail Property and Lexington Property, where net premiums written declined by 8%. International Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year, driven by modest growth in Casualty and Global Specialty, which was offset by declines in Property and Financial Lines. In the second quarter, Global Commercial continued to produce strong new business of nearly $1.4 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year quarter. In 2024, North America Commercial experienced tremendous new business growth. In 2025, we continue to see incremental growth led by Lexington Middle Market, Western World and our alternative businesses. It's worth noting that the submission count in our Lexington business continues to be very strong, increasing 28% year-over-year. International Commercial produced very strong new business in Specialty with a 35% increase from the prior year quarter, led by Marine and Energy. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention across North America Commercial and International Commercial of 88%. Global Personal net premiums written decreased 3%. As I discussed on previous earnings call, we entered into a high net worth quota share reinsurance treaty with strategic partners that is driving profitability improvement of the portfolio; however, it had a 6-point negative impact to Global Personal net premiums written growth in the quarter. Turning to expenses. Keith will go into more detail in his remarks, but I wanted to make a few points. Our General Insurance expense ratio was 31%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. For the first half of 2025, the General Insurance expense ratio was 30.8% compared to 31.6% for the prior year period. The General Insurance business has continued to absorb expenses that used to reside in other operations. In addition, we've made meaningful investments in cybersecurity and Gen AI and the costs for both are being absorbed in the businesses. For other operations, general operating expenses were $90 million in the quarter and $175 million for the first half of 2025. This is in line with a $350 million annual run rate for parent expenses for 2025, which is simply an outstanding result.

Now I'd like to take a moment to cover the Property Insurance market and the competitive nature of the rate environment, particularly in large account property as we enter wind season in the United States. This has been one of the most widely discussed topics in the industry, and I thought it was worth spending a few minutes outlining a technical view of AIG's underwriting approach to our U.S. property portfolio in this environment. My comments will focus on U.S. property because our International Property portfolio is experiencing very different market dynamics. It has terrific results and a rate environment that is currently positive. Our U.S. property business has been one of the best stories for AIG during the repositioning of our underwriting portfolio. What used to be a highly unprofitable portfolio with massive limits, combined ratios of 120 or greater and significant volatility accompanied with outside catastrophe losses has now become one of the most profitable lines of business for AIG. Even in the current environment, our portfolio has been performing exceptionally well across Retail Property and Lexington wholesale large account, where on average, pricing decreases have been 11% and Lexington Middle Market property was largely flat. Since 2018, Retail Property and Lexington wholesale large account, cumulative rate increases have been 135% and 120%, respectively, and Lexington Middle Market has had cumulative rate increases of 90%. Additionally, over the last several years, accident year combined ratios, as adjusted have been below 60% on average for both Retail and Wholesale Property. Further, and an important distinction, approximately 90% of our large account property, Retail and Wholesale, is placed on a shared and layered basis, which means nonconcurrent pricing and nonconcurrent terms on that placement. This allows us to establish differentiated pricing and policy wording coverages and exclusions for the limits we deploy for each risk. And when we report out our rate increases or decreases it is against the pricing that we established for our layer, not the index of the average pricing of the market for that placement. Also, with shared and layer placements, most of the business is net of commission. This means it has a very low acquisition expenses. In AIG's case, Retail Property has an acquisition ratio of approximately 1%. Inherently, it therefore has a higher loss ratio as the total premium includes very little expenses to gross up. In contrast, a Middle Market portfolio, which for AIG is 35% of our total property book has different characteristics. Middle Market accounts, have higher acquisition expense ratio and total expense ratio that translates to lower loss ratios because the total premium has grossed up through a higher total expense load. When reviewing the quality and profitability of our property portfolio at a high level, in addition to excellent individual risk underwriting, you should also have a technical view of the following components. Let's start with catastrophe. You need a proper analysis of potential CAT layers using extensive modeling, along with an accurate view of exposure and appropriate funding for CAT risks including comprehensive reinsurance at all appropriate return periods and tail risk. Then you should review average annual losses or AAL, which are CAT losses that are within your net retention below your Property CAT Reinsurance program that typically for lower return periods, net retained catastrophe requires an appropriate risk load. Also important are vertical single losses that are typically protected with property per risk reinsurance. And finally, you should consider attritional loss selections with an appropriate risk margin. When you analyze each of these components, I believe our approach has been conservative with respect to each variable. Why do I feel this way? The reason is we have a clear and detailed understanding of our fully loaded reinsurance CAT costs. We've been able to purchase reinsurance at low attachment points and have high exhaust limits. And importantly, these costs are fully embedded into our insurance pricing. This year, our risk-adjusted pricing decreases for reinsurance are at or greater than the pricing decreases on our primary business, limiting the impact of the rate environment on our net loss ratios. This would not be the case if you chose to take these layers net. Even with a significant increase in frequency of CATs, our AALs have been roughly equal to or greater than our actual experience over the past 3 years. On single large losses, we have significant protection on property per risk with reinsurance attaching at $25 million and exhausting in excess of $600 million. This is another strategic choice to reduce volatility, and we have fully embedded this cost into our pricing. We've also benefited from risk-adjusted pricing decreases on our property per risk treaties. The outcome of all of these variables is that our attritional loss ratios over the past 3 years have performed better than our expected accident year loss ratio picks. As I noted, another critical component of the loss projection is how much risk margin you have embedded as part of the ultimate accident year loss ratio. In our case, that market has continued to expand as a result of our exceptional underwriting and cumulative rate increases. When developing our loss picks, we include a risk margin that ranges from 10% to 20% depending on the segment of business. We've structured our portfolio to manage through various cycles. Going forward, we're looking to maintain our U.S. property portfolio, which is evidenced through our strong retention, growing where it makes sense for us based on risk-adjusted returns. And when market conditions warrant, we have the ability to pivot quickly. When you take into consideration all of these components of our Property portfolio, we expect in the current environment to deliver strong profitability in both Retail and Wholesale property. Now I'd like to provide an update on our operational accomplishments. At the end of 2023, we launched AIG Next to create a leaner, more simplified and more effective organization supported by the right infrastructure and capabilities while achieving at least $500 million in run rate savings. We embarked on this journey by pursuing a number of key initiatives. First, we created a lean parent company with costs aligned to being a public company, representing 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. In 2023, other operations expenses were approximately $1 billion. In order to achieve our future state parent expenses, we transferred $300 million as part of the Corebridge Financial divestiture. We either eliminated or reapportioned the remaining $350 million into our General Insurance businesses. Second, we drove global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes including centralizing our treasury and capital activities to create global enterprise standards. Third, we reduced organizational complexity through the creation of 3 distinct business segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal, which has led to better and differentiated experiences for our clients and partners. Fourth, we restructured and simplified our underwriting and claims organizations to accelerate and scale our data, digital and Gen AI strategy. And finally, we advanced our technology transformation and modernized our infrastructure, which included, among other initiatives, the elimination of 1,200 legacy applications. As we did with AIG 200 and our underwriting turnaround, I'm very pleased to share that we've achieved our objectives ahead of schedule. We actioned over $530 million of annual run rate expense savings with over $500 million realized through the second quarter.

I often say that one of the most impressive differentiators of AIG is our colleagues' ability to execute multiple complex strategic initiatives at the highest quality. The accelerated results that we've achieved through AIG Next are a testament to our culture of teamwork and willingness to execute at pace across the company. We thought it would be helpful to provide perspective on the Russia aviation-related claims, a complex industry topic in the headlines. These aviation insurance exposures are related to aircraft leased to Russian airlines that were kept in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. As you may recall, airline lessors are seeking compensation under contingent and possessed as well as operator policies covering both all risks and war apparels. On June 11, a judgment was issued in a legal proceeding in the U.K. in which a number of lessors led by AerCap brought claims against insurers that issued contingent and possess policies to them. In that judgment, the U.K. High Court ruled that the lessors suffered a covered war loss as a result of actions that the Russian government took in March of 2022. This decision aligns broadly with several prior rulings in the U.S. As we said at the outset, this was an unusual event for the industry with complicated issues, including whether covered loss occurred and when? Which peril triggered coverage? Did the lessors take appropriate steps to mitigate losses? Should sanctions apply? And which policy should respond? Contingent and possessed or operator? The situation was further complicated by the fact that many policyholders were quick to file coverage litigation, which significantly delayed the loss adjustment process. Despite these complexities, AIG, along with other insurers, made a concerted effort early to engage with policyholders in a unified manner to resolve the claims consensually reflecting the intent of the policies, which were written on a subscription basis in the London market. Unfortunately, the market participants were not able to agree on a solution, which is often the case in our industry and litigation proceeded in multiple jurisdictions, most notably in the U.K. In the U.K. proceeding, AIG was the lead all-risk representative defendant and as such, advance the position that any losses by AerCap should fall to the war cover, which was eventually adopted by the court. It's worth noting that AIG sought to and successfully settled all other claims under contingent and possessed policies in the U.K. proceeding prior to the AerCap ruling and, in many instances, obtained releases of our exposure under any applicable operator policies. With regard to the operator policies, there is a separate U.K. proceeding concerning claims that lessors have brought against AIG and several other insurers. We believe these operator claims face significant hurdles given among other factors that the relevant aircraft continue to be used by the Russian operators. Like many in the market, AIG wrote both all-risk and war policies. Early on, we conducted a thorough evaluation of the potential net financial impact of these claims on AIG, factoring in the complex coverage issues and all applicable reinsurance and barrier scenarios. As a result of this analysis, as I have stated previously, we prudently reserved for our expected net loss exposure and the outcome in the AerCap case, along with the settlements in other cases have been in line with our expected net loss estimates. Now let me take a few minutes to provide an update on our Gen AI work, which continues to accelerate while generating significant interest among our stakeholders. At our Investor Day, we provided an overview of our Gen AI approach and how we're deploying Gen AI end-to-end across the core business to power our underwriting business. Specifically, we talked about how we're leveraging large language models, our Agentic ecosystem of capabilities and our partnerships with AWS, Palantir and Entropic, among others. We laid out our framework, which is built around data ingestion, augmentation and prioritization powered by our Agentic AI ecosystem. We first deployed AIG underwriter assistance to our product non-for-profit business and Financial Lines at the end of the first quarter, and the early results are very promising. Submission ingestion has increased by 4x and the submit-to-find ratio has increased by 20% from the baseline. Looking forward, we remain on track to introduce AIG underwriter assistance for our Lexington Middle Market, Property & Casualty businesses in the third quarter of this year and across all of North America Commercial, U.K., and EMEA Commercial lines in 2026, and we continue to explore opportunities to accelerate our rollout. As we scale Gen AI across underwriting, we've also been building AIG claims assistance. We have successfully configured the core Gen AI capabilities of ingestion, augmentation and prioritization that we built for AIG underwriter assistance to support claims. With this framework, we can ingest unstructured data to expedite of loss, prioritize claims assignments and augment claims adjusters investigations with relevant, external multimodal data from approved sources. For claims, we've been training large language models to extract and organize key insights automatically to enable claims adjusters to make more informed decisions faster than ever in order to fulfill our promise of helping our clients when they need us most. We've conducted preliminary testing on the first notice of loss process, which is the first report made to an insurer about a potential claim. In our sample, the processing time has decreased from days to hours. We've also seen cycle time for coverage and endorsement reviews, a key part of a coverage assessment, decreased from hours to minutes. Our objective with these advanced tools is to enable more technical reviews, provide our underwriting and claims experts with more insight and capabilities, reduce cycle time, significantly enhanced decision-making and meaningfully improved service to our clients and partners. Foundational to this work is oncology. You will hear a lot more on this topic in the coming quarters, especially as we make more progress with our rollout. We've been building our AIG Ontology since we began our work in AI. It reflects an intent to create a digital twin of our business, representing all key data, processes, business logic and a map of relationships across businesses and functions. Ontology is critical for deploying large language models. It brings together the relevant data sets that define the components of our insurance business, integrates and sequences them and then models how they relate to one another. Our ontology will create a clear record of any actions taken, which will inform business logic and provide the ability to audit agents activities. We've seen an acceleration since Investor Day as large tech companies have made significant capital expenditure commitments to further advance Gen AI capabilities. I'm very encouraged with the progress that AIG is making. With that overview, I will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Francis Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. I'm going to expand on the financial highlights for the quarter. Overall, total adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.4 billion, an increase of 37% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by excellent results from the business and focused execution of our investment portfolio strategy. General Insurance gross premiums written were $10.1 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% from the prior year. Net premiums written were $6.9 billion, an increase of 1%. For the second quarter, General Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.4%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter. I'll unpack the loss ratio whe"

      "raw_bytes": "increase of 1%. For the second quarter, General Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.4%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter. I'll unpack the loss ratio when I cover the segments. Looking at expenses. In the second quarter, General Insurance expense ratio was 31.0%, a 50 basis point increase year-over-year. General Insurance absorbed $83 million of additional expenses that were booked in other operations in the second quarter of 2024. We remain on track to reduce our expense ratio below 30% by 2027. Moving to catastrophes. Charges for the quarter totaled $170 million or 2.9 loss ratio points. Prior year development for the quarter net of reinsurance was $128 million favorable, which included $97 million of favorable loss reserve development and $31 million of ADC amortization. The favorable development primarily stemmed from workers' compensation, largely driven by favorable trends on excess of loss sensitive business. U.S. property and special risks also developed favorably. We strengthened U.S. Casualty by $106 million, which is driven by mass tort and older accident years, of which the vast majority is in accident years 2015 and prior, which are covered by the ADC. We also reapportioned some of the uncertainty provision in casualty lines into the more recent accident years as we outlined in the fourth quarter. This is a prudent measure given broader litigation and inflationary trends in the industry. This was not related to any observable deterioration in our book. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was outstanding at 89.3%, a 320 basis point improvement compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to the segments. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 86.2%, an increase of 150 basis points over the prior year quarter. The accident year loss ratio of 63.1% was up 120 basis points, owing to changes in business mix as our casualty business grew, and we pulled back on property. Increased prudence in our 2025 loss picks predominantly in casualty lines given mass tort and general litigation trends and reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses into the loss ratio, largely related to lean parent implementation. The expense ratio was up 30 basis points to 23.1%, also driven by lean parent implementation. The quarter included 470 basis points of catastrophe losses and 500 basis points of favorable prior year development. North America Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 85.9%, an improvement of 430 basis points from the prior year. Turning to International Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.0%, an increase of 290 basis points. The accident year loss ratio was 54.2%, a 160 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting lean parent implementation, additional conservatism in lines facing macro uncertainties and changes in business mix. The expense ratio rose 130 basis points to 30.8%, driven by lean parent. This quarter included 140 basis points of catastrophe losses and 50 basis points of favorable prior year development. The International Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 85.9%, a 270 basis point improvement year-over-year. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of a sub-90% combined ratio and speaks to the high quality of our portfolio. Turning to Global Personal. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 96.1%, a 120 basis point improvement adjusting for the divested travel business. The accident year loss ratio was down 160 basis points to 54.2% driven by lower reinsurance costs, increased earned premiums as well as stronger underlying profitability. The expense ratio was up 40 basis points to 41.9%, also driven by lean parent implementation. This quarter included 240 basis points of catastrophe losses and no prior year development. The Global Personal calendar year combined ratio was 98.5% and an improvement of 170 basis points year-over-year. We continue to make progress increasing the profitability of our Global Personal business, as outlined at Investor Day. Moving to rates. Peter has already provided a detailed perspective on the property market, so my comments will focus on other lines. Market conditions for pricing have remained largely stable and consistent outside of property. Excluding the property business, our North America commercial pricing increased in the quarter by 6%, which is in line with loss cost trends. In North America Casualty, we continue to see price firming, especially in the excess casualty space with pricing up 17%. Primary Casualty saw 12% pricing increases, which were above loss cost trends. In North America Financial Lines, pricing reductions moderated to down 2%, which is the lowest level of decrease since rates moved negative in the second quarter of 2022 and was 3 points better than the first quarter. Moving to International Commercial. Overall pricing was down 3%. Global Specialty pricing was down 6%, Talbot down 3%, and Financial Lines down 4%. The AIG's well-diversified global portfolio allows us to manage across geography and products, prioritizing lines of business that offer the most compelling risk-adjusted returns while navigating a complex and dynamic global insurance market. Moving to other operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $106 million versus the prior year quarter of $163 million. This reflects a significant reduction in general operating expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net investment income. Adjusted for travel, the total general operating expenses across both General Insurance and other operations were $867 million in the second quarter, up 1% from the prior year. This small increase in GOE compares to 6% growth in net premiums earned. For the first half of 2025 total GOE was $1.7 billion, down 3% year-over-year, while net premiums earned grew by 4%. This is an excellent outcome, especially considering our continual investments in data, digital and Gen AI capabilities and reflects positive operating leverage from our expense discipline. The second quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $955 million, an increase of $76 million year-over-year. General Insurance net investment income was $871 million, growing 17% year-over-year. The increase was driven by fixed maturity securities owing to the optimization of our lower-yielding portfolios, asset growth, higher reinvestment yields and an adjustment of interest income primarily from the first quarter. For the first half of 2025, General Insurance net investment income was $1.6 billion and grew 7% year-over-year. This is a better indicator of our expected run rate for the full year, subject to market conditions. During the second quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was roughly 110 basis points higher than sales and maturities. Other operations net investment income of $88 million declined $48 million over the prior year quarter and reflects income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $58 million and Corebridge Financial dividend income of $27 million. Yesterday, we announced the sale of another 30 million shares of Corebridge Financial with proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This brings our ownership to roughly 15%. Peter already provided some detail on capital management in his remarks. Based on our current liquidity and cash flow profile, we anticipate being at the high end of our 2025 share repurchase guidance range of $5 billion to $6 billion, subject to market conditions. Turning to dividends. We increased our quarterly dividend in the second quarter by 12.5% to $0.45 per share delivering a third straight year of double-digit growth. Turning to liability management. We have made significant progress over the last several years improving our financial strength and flexibility. In May, we issued $1.25 billion of debt, upsizing the offering as a result of significant demand. The proceeds were p"

The proceeds were partially used to retire $830 million of debt effectively managing our maturity ladder. As a result, we have no material debt maturities in 2025 and 2026. We ended the quarter with approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding and a debt to total capital ratio of 17.9% amongst the lowest in our peer group. As Peter already mentioned, but it bears stating again, during the second quarter, AIG's major insurance subsidiaries received financial strength upgrades from S&P to AA- from A+, and Moody's to A1 from A2. These actions speak to the strength and stability of AIG are a meaningful validation from our key stakeholders and represent the collective hard work of our colleagues over several years. We continue to have strong capital ratios across our major insurance subsidiaries, which supports consistent and growing statutory dividends over time. We are on track to generate approximately $3 billion of subsidiary dividends in 2025. Book value per share at June 30 was $74.14 up 8% from June 30, 2024, reflecting strong growth in net income as well as the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $69.81 up 4% from June 30, 2024. In summary, we delivered an excellent second quarter with annualized core operating ROE of 11.7%. While the macro and insurance market remains dynamic, we are well positioned with multiple levers to drive continued strong performance. We remain on track to achieve our 10% plus core operating ROE target in 2025 and continue to make steady progress on the long-term financial targets we outlined at our Investor Day. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready to take questions."

I just wanted to make sure I understood that right. I mean it sounded like that net wasn't really much of a headwind actually in the underwriting. So I just wanted to understand if I'm getting that right, if it's more the mix shift and can you still hit the combined ratio targets you've talked about in the past?\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. So Alex, what I was trying to outline in my prepared remarks was, we are a big buyer of reinsurance on property. Everybody knows that. We have low attachment points. We have high exhaust. In a market like this, we benefit because if the rates are going down on reinsurance, on CAT as an example, that does benefit the original pricing. If you're funding it net, what I was saying, look, if I look at our own AALs, like if the market gets softer, I don't reduce the AALs, they stay the same. And so what I was trying to say is that when you look at the amount of reinsurance that we would purchase, we're getting risk-adjusted reductions that are at or greater than what we're pricing our original policies, that's a benefit. So there's no headwind there. But if you're funding it net, your AALs are still the same. So you have to take a look at your attritionals a little bit sharper, I believe, because the overall pricing is going down, if you don't have the commensurate rates going down on your catastrophe, that's a headwind. We don't have that. And so that's what I was just trying to unpack in sort of the different components of property. Now look, the combined ratio could go up a bit. We have great combined ratios. I've given some clarity at Investor Day and prior quarters that we posted in many of our businesses in the 70s combined ratio. So if it goes into the low 80s, it's still a great business. We are tempering our growth there because I don't know what happens to the rest of the year with CAT and it's just something we want to be cautious with, but we still want to retain the business. We still want to price it appropriately and believe that we can have very strong returns in the current environment as I look to 2025.\n\nTaylor Alexander Scott - Equity Research Analyst (Barclays):\nYes. That's helpful. Second one I had is sort of a follow-up on what I mentioned on growth. I mean, if the growth environment turns out to not be quite as good as expected, what will you do with the capital situation you have? Because I see premium to equity, I think it's a little below like 70%. I think that's the lowest in the peer group I look at, and that sort of not even that heavily influenced by the Corebridge proceeds when you have the holdco. So what will you do in the event that the growth outlook doesn't end up being what you had hoped for what you outlined at the Investor Day. How quickly would you take action to try to get some of that capital redeployed elsewhere?\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nWell, I outlined at Investor Day that over a period of time, undefined, but it would be a medium term that if we can't deploy the capital for growth, we will return it to shareholders. But we do believe -- look, it's a moment in time with the property, the second quarter before CAT season, the property lines run really well. And I'm going to ask Don and Jon to comment on this because we're seeing other opportunities for growth. I think that we're getting mass a little bit with property. We outlined it we've sort of bifurcated it because it's sort of anomalous to what's happening in the rest of our lines of business. But we don't need the capital to execute on our sort of capital management strategy out of the subsidiaries. And we really believe we can grow into it over a period of time. If we can't, and the market stays in a place where we have excess capital, we'll return it to shareholders. But I don't think that's the place we are. It's a moment in time in this particular quarter. I think we got to look out over the next few years. And I believe AIG now has a business that can grow. When we had the market turn last time, AIG wasn't prepared. We were still re-underwriting our portfolio. We still had a bottom 15%, 20%. We were growing in lines, repositioned the portfolio. The market turns this time. We have massive opportunities to have exponential growth, and we will execute on that. But Don, maybe let me start with you about what you're seeing in Casualty and then maybe I can shift to Jon talk a little bit about Specialty.\n\nDonald John Bailey - Chief Executive Officer, North America General Insurance (AIG):\nOkay. Rates are very strong in the casualty market right now. We've got gaining momentum there, both Lex Casualty and Retail Casualty grew rather substantially 19% in the second quarter, with Lex Casualty submissions are up 39% in the quarter. So gives us a lot of faith in terms of the Casualty opportunities we've got on a go-forward basis. In Financial Lines, Keith talked a little bit about the rate environment there, gaining stability much less of a headwind going forward. We're definitely going to see the rate opportunities as we go forward there and the growth opportunities to follow. Glatfelter is a machine for us, highly dependable growth engine for us. And with the work we've done with Glatfelter to kind of rebuild our programs business, that increasingly is a huge driver of our growth as we go forward as well. So that's going to start to deliver even more as we go forward. We covered some of those businesses in Investor Day. And I would just say this about Lex, too, that outside of the Large Account Property segment, every other segment within Lexington is growing quite nicely. And we had 28% increase in our submissions at Lexington in the quarter, which, again, is a strong indicator for future growth opportunities. Last thing I would just say, our distribution model is highly aligned to drive everything that I just talked about. So we see more and more opportunities ramping up as we go forward, and we continue to be a very strong brand at Lex, Glatfelter and AIG with our distribution partners and our insurers.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Don. That's helpful. Jon, maybe just talk about like Specialty and how we're positioned in the market would be great.\n\nJon Hancock - Chief Executive Officer, International General Insurance (AIG):\nYes, certainly. I mean, Specialty, we've highlighted this at Investor Day. We talk about it a lot because it is such a fantastic business for us. We've delivered 5% growth in the quarter, 7% year-to-date. And for sure, there is increasing competition and rate pressure generally. But global specialty as much as anywhere is an area we have real clear differentiated proposition. We're a leader. We're not an index for the market, and we're positioned, I think, better than anyone to achieve superior terms and manage through the cycles, and that's what we've been setting ourselves up over the years. And I think it's also worth saying on Specialty is, we're still seeing that good growth. The profit is phenomenally good. We're confident that, that maintains. It's a big part -- in the quarter, and I agree with you, Peter. I mean, a quarter is not a good judge of any growth plan. There's a lot of noise in any single quarter, look at the longer term, and that's what we build, certainly a specialty book for. If I stick to the quarter, Specialty is 45% of the International Commercial business on a gross basis. But it's only 28% of net premiums, and that's in part due to those reinsurance protections that you talked about, Peter. And those reinsurance protections do make the results better. It might m"

Yes, bear in mind as well, we've seen maybe 70% cumulative rate increase in Specialty over the last few years, a 20-odd percent in Energy. So we're really well positioned.

And I guess I know we're only looking at net numbers, but should we have seen something like that affect '23 and '24 as well?\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Meyer, I'm going to recap a little bit what I said and that Keith alluded to in the fourth quarter of sort of last year. We had this provisional reserve that we create in 2022, and then we did add to it in subsequent years to add to margin and it was really in response to some of the uncertainty with inflation, other variables sort of post pandemic and then sort of the social inflation environment that we're in. The provision, which included IBNR had been carried in lines that we thought would be most susceptible to the rising inflation. And the uncertainty provision was set above loss picks from our actuarial reviews that didn't have any reflection for any emergence or anything of that nature. And so we began the process of completing reserve reviews, apportioning them into lines of business that we thought were appropriate. And I think that's what you had started to see in the fourth quarter of 2024, and it will actually go through the fourth quarter of '25. So the accident year is the most recent ones, it wasn't that much, number one. Number two is a zero-sum game. Those reserves are already set. We just are putting them into lines of business that we think are the most appropriate when we look at the wide range of outcomes of Casualty, we just thought it was prudent to reapportion those accident years. There's nothing in the underlying portfolio that would suggest that those additional reserves are needed, but we have the uncertainty provision, and we're allocating them to lines of business throughout 2025.\n\nMeyer Shields - Equity Research Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay. That's helpful. And then a bigger picture question. When you talk to your insurers, I know there's a lot of concern in the insurance industry about social inflation. Is that translating into increasing demand for liability coverage? Is that manifesting itself in the market yet?\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI'll have Don comment a little bit on what we're seeing sort of in the casualty market. What I would say, Meyer, is that there is a strong pull for underwriting companies that have expertise in Casualty lines. So it's not just capacity. If you're going to lead, do you understand the complexities that exist within their business, their industry group, their structures, how do we help them think through the total cost of risk working with our partners. And I think when AIG had a slight pullback in casualty, there was a lot of demand from our clients asking for us to be more involved. And so I think the way in which we react to that is by trying to create solutions for our clients in the environment that we're in. So Don, maybe just quickly just what you're seeing in casualty to Meyer's question around client demand and how we're helping them on an advisory basis.\n\nDonald John Bailey - Chief Executive Officer, North America General Insurance (AIG):\nYes. Yes. The social inflation and some other factors in the casualty market, add the market appropriately disrupted and generally disciplined, and we expect that to continue. Social inflation, Meyer, it's a long-term issue. And why that matters is that casualty is a long-term relationship as opposed to a property relationship oftentimes. So these are 20-, 30-year relationships. So when we look at the question you're asking, buyers are definitely in a flight-to-quality mode where they see that long-term partner because of social inflation, being even more important and being even more critical. So our brand in this place, our multiline capabilities, our platform, our financial strength become incredibly attractive for brokers and buyers out there. So the flight-to-quality is real, and we'll see that as we go forward."

So maybe if you could just help by kind of parsing it out on the loss trends that you're seeing within kind of some number that's less than 6x property in that North America book? .\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Elyse. Look, we're not going to break it down by line. And if you look at where we're getting strong rate, it would be where there's a bigger loss cost trend. So if you think about Excess Casualty, in particular, some of the Retail Primary Casualty, we are looking at why we took out properties, it's a part of the index, but I think the loss cost trend is where we had outlined it on sort of on an index basis, and I think we are covering loss cost on casualty and other lines, excluding property.\n\nElyse Beth Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then my follow-up, has there been any significant change in price that you guys have seen in July relative to the Q2 just because I think, right, property is probably perhaps a bigger makeup of the second quarter.

I don't see -- we haven't seen any trends that are concerning different than what we reported for the first half of the year. And I think we really just need to play out the quarter as we go into the last 2 months of the quarter. So I just think it's too premature to outline anything in July or there's nothing that we've seen that is significantly different than what we reported in the second quarter."

Should we be thinking that the improvement is going to be a bit more kind of back-end loaded given the top line being weighted -- weighed down a bit by property rates or is that kind of not that much of a -- this operating leverage is not that much of a factor at this point?\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nLet me start with this. And I will like just provide a sort of high level than any details you want to add to it, please do. One is, we started this sort of process of apportioning parent expenses into the business in the third quarter of last year. Was it fully lower in the third and fourth quarter? No, but it was mostly there. So I think when you look at the first half of the year, it's kind of a continuation of what we did from other ops GOE into the business. I don't think the second quarter is an accurate run rate. I think it starts to bend the curve a bit in the third and fourth, where there's less going into the business when you compare it to sort of the second quarter. There's some onetime sort of headwinds in the second quarter. But like we're really just focused on getting to future state, which I think we've done an exceptional job in terms of the parent company. The business has done a tremendous job of absorbing those costs? And I thought it would actually be a longer transition it has not been. And then you have to recognize, too, we haven't fully earned in all the AIG Next. While we have completed the $500 million, we still have more to earn-in in terms of incremental in-year benefits in the third and fourth quarter. So look, this isn't guidance that you ought to like take it way down, but it is guidance saying that I think you got to look at it for the full year, like the first half was a little bit more bumpy than I think the back half will be, and we're going to watch sort of the earned premium and making sure that we don't have any issues on the expense side. But Keith, I mean, a couple of variables you may want to add?\n\nKeith Francis Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. Just 3 quick points, and Peter said it well. The first thing it's not linear, right? Quarter-to-quarter, I think, is a good way of looking at. Looking at it over the course of the full year is a better way. Just a couple of quick points. In my script, we talked about -- I wanted to give you a fully loaded view of expense, looking at GOE plus other operations expenses to get a feel for, are we getting the expenses? And the answer is yes, right? You see minus 3% in the first half of the year when you load fully -- full expenses together and plus 1 in the quarter and that compares to 6% -- 4% and 6% growth on the top line, respectively. So we're getting the operating leverage. Point two, if you look at the expense ratio, it's up 20 bps adjusted for travel in the first half, and that's with more than 100 basis points of parent cost push down. So we're getting -- again, the ratio is underlying improving. And the third thing to Peter's point he made is that the noise from this, the parent pushdown will dissipate over time. This quarter, we had $90 million of expense. It was $184 million in the prior year. The third quarter had $144 million. So you're starting to see -- and once we get to fourth quarter, that will completely dissipate as we get into 2026.\n\nMichael David Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Perfect. That's helpful. My follow-up questions on the E&S marketplace. I believe, Peter, you cited submissions in Telex being plus high 20s, which just seem like -- I don't think you disclosed it every quarter, but it seemed like a very high level. Can you maybe just kind of talk about dynamics in that marketplace? I guess some folks ask us that given property is correcting a bit off of very healthy levels, we shouldn't eventually the retailers look to kind of find capacity and move some of that property out of the E&S market, which could slow the submission rate, at least, I guess. So any comments would be helpful.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nMy first comment is to be careful who you speak to, because this dynamic is very different than any other market where industry executives that have been in the wholesale and retail will expect this to be a market that just transitions back into retail. And that may or may not happen. We're not seeing it. I mean so we keep citing the submission count is because it's not that we're surprised, but we're like unbelievably encouraged because in a market that typically would find Retail Casualty and Retail Property being more in demand, that doesn't seem to be the case. And so when we look at our own growth, Lexington Casualty is growing very strong. Property, to be honest, held up better than the Retail. And that's from the Middle Market play that we had in the past. And I think that wholesale brokers have become more than E&S market placement. They are now a broad range of whether it's through MGAs and MGUs or actually being placement mechanisms for the 40,000 independent agents that exist within the United States. So I think that the market is seeing some pricing pressure, but so is the Retail. And there's no evidence from us that it's slowing down in terms of submission count. And we outlined at Investor Day is that if we can start to harness that submission count and get it to better buying ratios because it's a business that we like, we still see growth opportunities. It's not that we're saturated with the submission count that we're maximizing our own growth potential or the industry is. And there may be new entrants, new participants, but very relevant in terms of the market that we trade in. So we remain encouraged, cautious because we want to watch what's happening within the property, but overall, it's holding up really well. Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody participating. I want to thank all of our AIG colleagues for yet another outstanding contribution to this quarter, and I wish everybody a great day."

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan - Head of Investor Relations (AIG):\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to net premiums written are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Page 27 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2025 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide more detail, and then Jon Hancock and Don Bailey will join us for the Q&A portion of our call. This has been an exceptional third quarter for AIG and an incredibly busy one. We achieved tremendous EPS and ROE results as we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Last week, we had several announcements involving Convex Group, Onex Corporation and Everest Group. The key takeaway is that they are all expected to be earnings, EPS and ROE accretive in the first year post closing. We believe each will accelerate AIG's progress and create long-term value for our company and our stakeholders. And this was made possible due to our strong balance sheet, prudent capital management and financial flexibility. It's simply been an outstanding quarter, and I'm very proud of our colleagues for all they've accomplished together. For our call this morning, I will share a high-level overview of our third quarter results, provide a perspective on our strategic investments in renewal rights acquisition, give a brief update on our GenAI initiatives and conclude with an overview of our capital management strategy and the progress against our Investor Day financial objectives. In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted after-tax income per diluted share of $2.20, which is an increase of 77% year-over-year. Adjusted after-tax income for the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 52% year-over-year, driven by our General Insurance business. Underwriting income was $793 million, an increase of 81% year-over-year. Net investment income on an adjusted pretax basis was $1 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 88.3%, in line with the prior year quarter and our 16th consecutive quarter with a sub-90% result. The calendar year combined ratio was 86.8%, an improvement of 580 basis points from the prior year quarter. Now let me provide some detail on our performance across the three business segments. Let's start with North America Commercial Insurance. Net premiums written were flat year-over-year. It's worth noting, which we mentioned on our third quarter 2024 earnings call, that we had a closeout transaction in our casualty portfolio that benefited overall growth in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for this, net premiums written would have increased 3%. This growth was driven in targeted areas, notably Programs, which increased 27%; Western World, which increased 11%; and Excess Casualty, which increased 8%. This was partially offset by Retail Property, which declined 10%; and Lexington Property, which declined 8%, where rate pressure has been most prevalent. We spoke about Property quite a bit last quarter. Keith will go into more detail in his prepared remarks, and we can discuss further in Q&A. Despite pressure on rates, the accident year and calendar year combined ratios remain exceptional for the Property portfolio. North America new business was very strong. While Lexington's new business was flat year-over-year, it was the biggest nominal contributor to new business in North America. Its submission count was up 18% year-over-year, following significant increases over the last 2 years of 34% in the third quarter of 2024 and 47% in the third quarter of 2023. Financial Lines new business was up 16%, led by M&A. Turning now to International Commercial Insurance. Net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year, driven by Marine, which increased 11%; and Property, which increased 6%. This was partially offset by Financial Lines, which declined 6%. International Commercial had an outstanding quarter for new business led by Specialty, which increased 17% year-over-year driven by Marine, which increased 35%; and Energy, which increased 30%. Property increased 24%, and Financial Lines increased 12%, driven by higher M&A activity in the quarter. In Global Personal, net premiums written decreased 4%, driven by the high net worth quota share reinsurance treaty that we entered into at 1/1/25. While this continues to improve profitability in the portfolio for 2025, it negatively impacted Global Personal net premiums written. We expect to see this premium trend reverse in 2026. Overall, it was a great quarter of performance for AIG, and it positions us for a strong finish to 2025. Last week was a momentous one for AIG. We announced strategic investments with Convex Group, Onex Corporation and a transaction with Everest Group. These will strengthen AIG's long-term value and strategic positioning, and we expect they will be earnings, EPS and ROE accretive 1 year after closing, aligned with the objectives we outlined at Investor Day. This is in line with my previous comments that we would look for compelling opportunities to deploy capital in ways that would be accretive to our financial metrics and to further build our business. As a point of reference, over the last 3 years, we've returned a total of $19 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $16 billion of share repurchases and $3 billion of common stock dividends. In addition, we reduced debt by $4.5 billion. We now believe we have a capital structure that's optimal for our current business. When you look at the global insurance industry, there's a scarcity of high-quality insurance assets. We've been fortunate to secure a long-term investment in one of the very best global specialty and reinsurance companies, Convex Group. I know Convex Group extremely well and have known and traded with its Chairman, Stephen Catlin and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Brand, for over 20 years. I have deep respect for their expertise, leadership and the culture they have built. With Convex, we will gain access to a world-class underwriting platform for complex specialty risks wi"

With Convex, we will gain access to a world-class underwriting platform for complex specialty risks with a strong underwriting culture, a growing premium base and a proven track record of outstanding performance and profitability. Stephen and Paul have earned a reputation for building exceptional underwriting teams, and this is reflected in the company's impressive performance. Convex was founded in 2019 and has consistently delivered very strong underwriting and financial results, with a combined ratio in the high 80s, no historical reserve issues, no legacy technology debt, a highly scalable platform and significant potential for continued growth. Over the last 3 years, Convex delivered a 25% compound annual growth in gross premiums written and an 18% average return on equity, demonstrating the strength of their business model and ability to produce sustainable long-term value. Last week, AIG agreed to acquire a 35% equity interest in Convex, while Onex Corporation took a 63% ownership position to be held directly on their balance sheet rather than through one of their investment funds. In addition, to benefiting from the ongoing success of Convex through an equity investment, AIG will also participate in Convex's portfolio through a whole account quota share, which enables us to share directly in Convex's underwriting growth and expected profitability over the short, medium and long term. The agreement gives AIG the opportunity to participate in 7.5% of Convex's portfolio on January 1, 2026, and that will progressively increase to 10% by 2027 and 12.5% by 2028. The Convex transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026. As part of our discussions with Convex management, we were presented with an opportunity to acquire a minority ownership stake in Onex Corporation. With headquarters in Toronto, Onex is a leading private equity and credit investor with $56 billion of assets under management and 120 investment professionals based across Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. Our strategic relationship with Onex presents a unique opportunity for AIG to partner through an equity investment with a global asset manager with a strong record of investing in the insurance sector. Onex has made a number of notable and highly successful strategic investments in specialized insurance platforms, including Convex, Ryan Specialty, OneDigital and USI. Let me unpack the details of our investment in Onex. We've agreed to acquire a 9.9% equity interest. Additionally, in line with our investment guidelines, we've committed to invest $2 billion over 3 years across Onex's broad asset management platform, which will provide us with a broader view of opportunities and deepen our market position within the global insurance industry. Keith will provide more detail in his remarks, but just to give you a brief overview, these investments have the potential to deliver a higher yield for AIG, supporting earnings growth and enhancing return on equity. We have evaluated investment opportunities in several fund managers in the alternative asset space over time and believe this is the right opportunity for us. Post transaction, over 40% of Onex's total balance sheet net asset value is expected to relate to its majority ownership of Convex. The Onex transaction is also expected to close in the first half of 2026. Finally, last week, we also announced our acquisition of the renewal rights for the majority of Everest's core retail commercial property and casualty portfolios, representing approximately $2 billion of gross premiums written across multiple geographies. We greatly appreciate Everest's willingness to engage in a bilateral discussion to structure a transaction that further strengthens both companies and our mutual business relationship. We purchased the renewal rights for approximately $300 million with a potential downward adjustment of up to $70 million, depending on how much of the portfolio is renewed with AIG. Under the terms of the transaction, AIG did not take any of the in-force portfolio or unearned premium for policies with effective dates prior to December 31, 2025, and we will not assume any liabilities for any of the policies previously underwritten by Everest. Everest employees will remain with Everest Group, though in certain geographies and businesses, we will work with Everest to offer opportunities to select staff members. We've also entered into a transition service agreement with defined service levels to ensure continuity for clients and brokers as the portfolio is transferred to AIG. In terms of the portfolio, it's well diversified across geographies and classes of business. The largest portion of the in-force eligible gross premiums written is in the United States at $1.3 billion, followed by Europe at $400 million, the U.K. at $150 million, Australia at $80 million and Singapore at $70 million. Approximately 60% of this portfolio will renew in the first half of 2026. Canada, Latin America and certain lines of business, including aviation, surety and wholesale are specifically excluded. From a business mix perspective, the portfolio is approximately 40% Casualty, 30% Property, 25% Financial Lines with the balance being Specialty classes. Everest's view, as stated on their earnings call, is that there was no further re-underwriting of the Casualty portfolio required and 80% of the adverse development in their Casualty portfolio in the back years are from policies that have not been renewed. We will complete our own assessment, but believe they've done a very good job of remediating the portfolio. We have extensive experience repositioning portfolios, particularly in Casualty. It's my view that we have the best casualty underwriters in the business. And when combined with stricter underwriting standards that Everest implemented over the last 12 months, we are confident that the portfolio will be positioned for success. AIG can absorb the business in our current infrastructure with no additional capital, and we will deliver an improved offering to clients and our distribution partners. The reaction from our broker partners to the transaction has been incredibly positive. They're very excited to work with us and committed to converting the book to AIG, providing welcome continuity to their clients. We anticipate being able to add this portfolio into our 1/1 reinsurance treaty renewals with no change in terms and conditions. This transaction adds further scale to AIG's upper middle and large account retail insurance book, providing an opportunity to drive premium growth without adding meaningful costs. The actions we have taken over the past several years have positioned us with the balance sheet and liquidity to pursue compelling opportunities when they materialize. Convex, Onex and Everest are unique opportunities that came to AIG first because of our strong brand, strong performance and the personal relationships that we've developed over time. As a result of these transactions, we are enhancing our earnings potential, driving incremental ROE and putting our capital to work to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. Now I want to provide a brief update on GenAI and how we are strategically embedding it into our core underwriting and claims processes. Each quarter, and especially since Investor Day, we have meaningfully advanced progress, and now we're deploying GenAI solutions on a more accelerated basis. In my career, I've never seen anything progress at the pace and scale like I've witnessed in the last 6 months with GenAI and compute. We at AIG want to be in a position to be able to adapt to these changes as effectively as possible. As a reminder, our objective has always been to provide more insight on the data that we receive from distribution partners through the submission process to enhance our underwriting, supplement that data with rel"

      "raw_bytes": ", our objective has always been to provide more insight on the data that we receive from distribution partners through the submission process to enhance our underwriting, supplement that data with reliable and verifiable additional sources and significantly reduce cycle time for our underwriters to make informed decisions in a fraction of the time. That is our future. We started late last year with the rollout of underwriting by AIG Assist in our North America Financial Lines business, and we continue to see strong results. For our private and not-for-profit business today, we're processing 100% of the applicable submissions using underwriting by AIG Assist, which has increased our submit-to-buying ratio. This quarter, we deployed underwriting by AIG Assist in our Lexington middle market property and casualty business. In the E&S market and for Lexington, in particular, speed drives growth. As I outlined earlier and in prior calls, the middle market submission counts are growing dramatically. We have nearly 200,000 submissions year-to-date. We simply cannot get to all the submission activity, and this is a problem that's not going to be solved by simply adding underwriters. We are accelerating the rollout of underwriting by AIG Assist and we'll deploy across the rest of our Lexington business by the end of 2025. We've also moved up the rollout to the rest of North America, U.K. and EMEA commercial lines by 6 months. As a reminder, we've also been piloting claims by AIG Assist since last quarter, and we're seeing terrific results. We're reducing the time it's taking our claims teams to receive first notice of loss reports and to issue coverage letters. One of the main challenges in implementing GenAI solutions is the time and effort needed to build an accurate source of data from a heterogeneous population of documents. To make it easier, we developed a patent-pending approach called [ Auto Extract ]. Auto Extract is a capability that uses large language models to pull specific structured information from unstructured text such as documents in multiple formats, websites and conversations. It works by developing a content-specific large language model that generates prompts containing instructions on what to extract and then analyze the text and returns, the requested data in a structured format. This solution makes it easier to process, analyze and use large amounts of data that would otherwise require extensive manual effort. Another use case we've developed is a capability to ingest the Schedule P information for over 225 U.S. insurance companies. We leverage this information for a variety of insights to determine correlations among loss ratios over certain development periods, specific reserve development and other insights across specific lines of business such as other liability occurrence. We gathered over 4 million data points, augmented the data with publicly available information, created an ontology and trained an agent in the ontology to identify trends. We use this in our portfolio management efforts to support our business and provide unique insights. I'll now shift to capital management. In the third quarter, we continued to execute against our disciplined and balanced strategy, while maintaining our financial strength. Keith will take you through the specifics. As we look to the future, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue our share repurchases in 2026, albeit at a normalized level. And over time, we will also look for more compelling opportunities to deploy capital to drive long-term strategic value. Before I close, let me give you a little more specificity on how we're tracking to our Investor Day metrics. We set very aspirational objectives at Investor Day. And through the first 9 months of the year, we are ahead of what we outlined at the beginning of the year, which is an enormous achievement. As I noted earlier, EPS has been very strong in 2025. We achieved a core operating ROE of 13.6% in the third quarter, up 430 basis points year-over-year. Year-to-date, our core operating ROE is 10.9%, which is well within the 10% to 13% range we stated at Investor Day and believe we can maintain and grow this metric through 2027. We are continuing to make progress towards an expense ratio below 30% for General Insurance, and believe we have further opportunities to streamline our expense structure going forward. Finally, we grew our dividend per share by over 10% in 2025. And subject to Board approval, we expect to be in a position to do the same in 2026. In summary, we had an outstanding third quarter, made significant advancements in our strategic deployment of capital with three unique opportunities, and we're very committed to delivering on our 3-year guidance. I'll now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. I'm going to expand on the financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.6 billion, an increase of 51% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong results from the business and execution of our investment portfolio strategy. General Insurance gross premiums written were $8.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 1% from the prior year. Net premiums written were $6.2 billion, a decrease of 1%. As Peter discussed, we had strong new business and retention in the quarter. I will comment on the rate environment later in my remarks. For the third quarter, General Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, which is the same as the prior year quarter. Accident year loss ratio was 57.4%, a 100 basis point increase year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses, and we had more favorable actual versus expected recognized in Specialty in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by underlying improvement in Global Personal. Our General Insurance expense ratio was 30.9%, a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year. For the first 9 months of 2025, the General Insurance expense ratio was 30.8% compared to 31.7% for the prior year period. This demonstrates our operational excellence and discipline in driving efficiencies as we have shifted expenses from other operations into General Insurance while investing in underwriting capabilities, technology and infrastructure. For context, since 2023, the business has absorbed an additional $400 million of parent costs that used to be in other operations. We expect to be at $350 million of other operations expense for full year 2025. Our teams have done a fantastic job of managing expenses, and we expect to achieve our target of below 30% by 2027. Total catastrophe losses for the quarter totaled $100 million or 1.6 loss ratio points, an excellent result. Prior year development, net of reinsurance, was $205 million favorable, which included $174 million of favorable loss reserve development and $31 million of ADC amortization. North America Commercial was favorable $139 million across our Property, Casualty and Financial Lines. International Commercial was also favorable by $47 million, primarily driven by shorter-tail lines in Global Specialty, partially offset by movements on select longer-tail lines, largely driven by auto trends and adverse development on pre-2018 general liability reserves. Global Personal was $19 million favorable. These results include a reapportionment of the remainder of our uncertainty provision across all three segments, predominantly into longer tail lines. Similar to last quarter, this was not related to any observable deterioration in our book. We continue to build on our strong balance sheet and have a high level of confidence in our reserve position, supported by the favorable actual versus expected trends we continue to observe. Overall, General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was outstanding at 86.8%, a 580 basis point improvement compared to the "

Overall, General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was outstanding at 86.8%, a 580 basis point improvement compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to the segments. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The accident year loss ratio of 62.1% was up 30 basis points, owing to changes in business mix as we continue to earn in Casualty business and reduce certain property lines, and a partial onetime offset due to last year's Casualty closeout transaction. The expense ratio was flat to last year at 23.3%, including a 60 basis point improvement in the acquisition ratio, offset by a higher GOE ratio due to the movement of expenses into the business from other operations. The quarter included 310 basis points of catastrophe losses and 590 basis points of favorable prior year development. North America Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 82.6%, an improvement of almost 13 percentage points. Turning to International Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 86.0%, an increase of 260 basis points. The accident year loss ratio was 54.4%, a 170 basis point increase year-over-year, largely from reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses and less favorability in Specialty, as we mentioned earlier. The expense ratio rose 90 basis points to 31.6%, driven by movement of expenses from other operations. This quarter included 80 basis points of catastrophe losses and 190 basis points of favorable prior year development. The International Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 84.9%. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of a sub-90% combined ratio for the International Commercial segment, which speaks to the quality of our portfolio. Turning to Global Personal. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 95.5%, a 330 basis point improvement year-over-year, adjusting for the divested travel business. The accident year loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 55.3%, driven by underwriting actions leading to stronger underlying profitability and lower reinsurance costs. The expense ratio improved 240 basis points to 40.2%, driven by the acquisition ratio, which is benefiting from a combination of improved commission terms in the U.S. high net worth business, operational efficiencies and changes in business mix. This quarter included 80 basis points of catastrophe losses and 110 basis points of favorable prior year development. The Global Personal calendar year combined ratio was 95.2%, an improvement of 520 basis points year-over-year. We continue to make steady progress increasing the profitability of Global Personal as outlined at Investor Day. Moving to rates. In North America, market conditions for pricing have remained largely stable. Excluding the Property business, our North America Commercial renewal pricing increase was 5%. In North America Casualty, the overall pricing environment remains favorable with Retail Excess Casualty up 13% and Lexington Casualty up 14%. In North America Financial Lines, pricing was down 2%, in line with the second quarter. The pricing reductions have moderated, and we continue to focus on our differentiated offering and leadership position. North America Property continued to see pricing pressure with the overall portfolio showing improvement from last quarter, largely as a result of mix. The property market rate environment remains challenging, and we continue to have strong profitability across our retail and wholesale business, while prioritizing underwriting discipline. International Commercial overall pricing was down 2%. Across our International Property portfolios, pricing was up 4%, driven by 16% rate increases in Japan. Global Specialty pricing was down 4%. Since 2018, the cumulative rate increases in our Global Specialty book have been very strong, with over 100% increase in Energy where rates are currently challenged. Overall pricing remains above our technical view. Talbot and Financial Lines pricing was also down 4%. AIG's well-diversified global portfolio allows us to manage across geography and products, prioritizing lines of business that offer the best risk-adjusted returns. Moving to Other Operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss was $116 million versus the prior year quarter of $135 million. This reflects a significant reduction in general operating expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net investment income as we reduced our Corebridge Financial stake. Total GOE across both General Insurance and Other Operations was $866 million in the third quarter, up 1% from the prior year adjusting for Travel. For the 9 months of 2025, total GOE was $2.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year, while net premiums earned grew by 5%. This is an impressive outcome, reflecting positive operating leverage, allowing us to create bandwidth for future investments. The third quarter net investment income on an APTI basis reached $1 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. General Insurance net investment income was $945 million, growing 22% year-over-year. The increase was driven by fixed maturity securities, owing to the optimization of our lower-yielding portfolios, asset growth and higher reinvestment yields in addition to improved alternative returns. During the third quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was roughly 95 basis points higher than sales and maturities. The annualized yield was 4.58%, a 69 basis point improvement over the prior year. Alternative investment income was also very strong this quarter at $137 million, yielding 13.6% compared to $43 million and 4.3% in the prior year quarter. Our well-diversified private equity portfolio contributed to this excellent performance. At Investor Day, we talked about opportunities to optimize our core portfolio, particularly in some lower-yielding geographies as well as prudently increasing the allocation to private credit when we see attractive premiums over public credit. As part of the reshaping of our portfolio, we have reduced hedge funds and global real estate by $1.5 billion collectively since 2021. We largely have completed the rebalancing of public credit across multiple geographies. Yields are now more consistent with where we believe we should operate, and we expect net investment income growth going forward to be more in line with asset growth given the current and projected level of global interest rates. Over the next few years, we will opportunistically allocate funds to private credit, which currently stands at $6.4 billion at the end of the third quarter or 8% of the GI portfolio. Overall allocations to private credit have not materially changed since Investor Day. As stated at Investor Day, we intend to take that up to 12% to 15% over time, subject to market conditions. Private credit is a large and diverse asset class. We expect to participate in the highest quality assets where we will get paid for the risk. We have private credit mandates with a small group of strategic partners who follow strict investment guidelines. We do a detailed review of every transaction we enter into and are very thoughtful about deployment and aggregation. We are pleased Onex will be one of those strategic partners. We have committed to invest $2 billion over 3 years across Onex's broad asset management platform, including insurance co-investments outside of Onex' funds, which will provide us with a broader view of opportunities in the industry. We are in the process of divesting some noncore legacy private assets, mostly in real estate, and we will look to deploy some of those proceeds in Onex managed strategies over time, such as CLOs and broadly syndicated loan portfolios where Onex has a strong track record. Our expectation is that our investment opportunities with Onex will be accretive to "

Our expectation is that our investment opportunities with Onex will be accretive to our investment yield. Turning to Other Operations. Net investment income of $77 million declined $43 million over the prior year quarter and largely reflect income from our parent liquidity portfolio of roughly $50 million and Corebridge Financial dividend income of $20 million. This quarter, we updated the investment portfolio disclosure in our financial supplement to more clearly show the split between our General Insurance portfolio and the assets sitting within Other Operations. Turning to capital management. In the third quarter, we continued to execute against our strong, disciplined and balanced strategy while maintaining our strong ratings and financial flexibility. We completed the sale of another 31 million shares of Corebridge Financial for proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This brings our ownership in Corebridge to roughly 15.5%. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the third quarter through approximately $1.25 billion of share repurchases and approximately $250 million of common stock dividends. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have repurchased $5.3 billion, reducing shares outstanding to roughly 544 million. We continue to actively repurchase shares at what we view as attractive levels. Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue our share repurchase in 2026, albeit at more normalized levels. As we stated at Investor Day, we generate roughly $3 billion of ordinary dividends from our insurance subsidiaries annually. We expect share repurchases up to $1 billion for 2026. We maintained our outstanding financial position in the third quarter with strong parent liquidity and a debt to total capital ratio of 18%. Over time, we will also look for ways through additional investments and acquisitions to drive long-term strategic value for the company and our shareholders. Book value per share at September 30 was $75.45, up 6% from September 30, 2024, reflecting strong growth in net income as well as the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $70.07, up 3% from September 30, 2024. In summary, we delivered an excellent third quarter with annualized core operating ROE of 13.6% and 10.9% through the first 9 months of 2025. While the macro and insurance market remain dynamic, we are well positioned with multiple levers to drive continued strong performance. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Keith. Michelle, we're ready for questions."

First of all, on Convex, it's a whole account quota share. It's a great company with a tremendous track record of profitability, and we are so pleased to be participating at 1/1 with a 7.5% share. That will grow to 10% in '27 and then 12.5% in the subsequent year. So that's really positive across the entire book, and we will benefit from that because of the combined ratios that they run. In terms of Everest, I'm going to make some comments, and I'm going to ask Jon Hancock to make a couple of comments because Jon ran the business process for the renewal rights for AIG. It's a $2 billion portfolio. You have to take it in pieces. And so the International portfolio has performed very well. I mean when we look at the combined ratios of their International business, it's similar to ours and would expect the conversion for the combined ratios to be at ours and maybe even a little bit better over time because of the scale that can help the expense side. When you look at the U.S., I'll give you just in the spirit of time, the three pieces. First is Property. Property portfolio runs very well. Attritional loss ratios are similar to ours. We may put a little bit more cat load on their portfolio, but AIG's cat load for our funded AAL will not go up. We've been doing an exceptional job on our gross book as well as reinsurance. And so that will be at our combined ratios, which have been exceptional. If you look at Financial Lines, I think their loss ratios for their book run a little higher than ours, but the expense ratio with the conversion of the portfolio will run lower. So I would think on the Financial Lines, the overall combined ratio will be at ours. So there'll be very similar conversion in terms of overall economics on a combined ratio basis. And then the one that gets all the attention is the Casualty. So the Casualty, when Everest reports out, they're doing it on their back book, the earned book, not necessarily on a written basis. And so I think it's really important to take a look at that as to how it's run. I put in my prepared remarks because it was their own comments in terms of the further reserve strengthening required was from a part of a portfolio, 80% that doesn't exist anymore. And then the other piece, and I'll get to the reinsurance in a second, is that I think it's my view that we have the best casualty underwriters in the marketplace led by Barbara Luck. We've done this before. We've looked at a portfolio and said, this is what we think the structure needs to be in terms and conditions and pricing. And so I think we have a really strong track record of delivering that. Even if we deliver, the majority of the Casualty portfolio will still be less than 20% of our overall casualty. And we have a very sound, attractive and one of the best structures, I believe, in casualty reinsurance, which means we protect it from volatility. The ceding commission will absolutely be a tailwind and accretive to the combined ratio. We have a low 30 seed. We're bringing very little expense over. The acquisition expenses are at or slightly below ours. I would look to forecast them at ours. But we would expect even on a written basis, same-store sales with the way we're structured, the way we underwrite and the way we structure reinsurance that the combined ratios are going to improve in a meaningful way. Jon, do you want to just give a quick overview in terms of how you look to the book when you're doing diligence?\n\nJon Hancock - Executive (likely CEO of International or similar senior leadership) (AIG):\nYes, I will. Thanks, Peter. I mean I'd start by saying I think this is a great deal for everyone, for us, for Everest and critically for those brokers and clients. And we're getting great reaction from all of them. It's a strong AIG with a global footprint in lines of business that we like, we know and we already like a lot of, and where we've already got big and existing relationships with everyone. So this is about building on that rather than start from scratch. And I'd love the fact we did the deal at pace. We both decided very early on, it was the right thing for us. Hence, that bilateral discussions that you talked about, Peter. We wanted to do it, but we did it thoroughly, and we did it quickly. And everybody knows AIG's commercial business is incredibly strong. You see that through our results every quarter, and we want it to grow faster. And I think this is a great opportunity to help do just that. AIG and Everest, we've got to know each other pretty well through this transaction. And as you say, we think they've done a really good job of building their business, re-underwriting where they need to be. But I would stress, I agree with you, it's not everywhere, it's in certain places. And it's a great fit for our existing business to add to it. It's a sort of business we like. And being the incumbent is important in our industry. It's important for us, for the broker and client. It means we don't have to re-underwrite all over again. We do have that continuity. We renew together rather than starting again. And a renewal rights deal like this brings that into play. So there's an advantage to all of us. And as you say, we're determined to renew the whole portfolio. We've looked at the portfolio carefully. And I want to say as well, we know there are some overlaps. Of course, there are. Sometimes they're on the same risks, same or different layers, and we're really comfortable with that. We've looked at the portfolio. We've been managing our limits and exposures waiting for growth opportunities like this. So we know we've got plenty of capacity and everything will be well within our risk appetite. So that's how we looked at it. Now we'll get it renewed by making it seamless, straightforward, given that continuity that is so important. And we've already reached out to thousands of brokers and hundreds of clients as have Everest, we started those conversations. And we've got tremendous support from all of those brokers and clients. We're very grateful for that, and we're totally focused now on getting this business into the portfolio.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThanks, Jon. That's great. Alex, do you have a follow-up?\n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nYes. As a follow-up, I noticed the comments suggested you're continuing to look for further opportunities. And so I just wanted to get a feel for how much more capacity do you have to go continue to do deals like this? What type of stuff are you looking at?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nWell, I said it at Investor Day, I've said it on these calls in the past, and I'll reiterate it now, which is that we look for opportunities that are strategically enhancing to AIG. We've laid out financial metrics in terms of earnings, EPS and ROE accretion. I think the really important point to think about is Convex, Onex and Everest were all"

And so we will continue to look at opportunities that fulfill sort of that strategic intent. I would expect to see more. We saw quite a bit before we did these deals. I mean this wasn't the first opportunities that were presented to us. And we'll make sure that it's very additive to AIG and that there is alignment with whoever we're working with.

If I look at what you said about $5 billion of holdco liquidity at quarter end and you've got the Corebridge deal, and you've got a fair amount of holdco liquidity right now. I'm just curious what your thoughts are and what's kind of the minimum level of holdco liquidity you want to keep on your balance sheet?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Brian. I'll have Keith fill in the details. But I mean, of course, the quarter end liquidity didn't contemplate that we're going to have to use that for some of the investments we've just outlined and the strategic acquisitions. We did -- Keith just kept in his prepared remarks before the Q as to our ownership within Corebridge. We exercised last night a sale of around 32 million shares. So that's another $1 billion of proceeds to fund the acquisitions, but also our continued capital management. And we will be very consistent in what we outlined at Investor Day. We returned so much capital to shareholders, and that was the right thing to do based on the liquidity and the divestitures of Corebridge. But I think we're in a more normal state now where we're going to have those balanced investments and continue to build inorganic opportunities. Keith?\n\nKeith Walsh - Chief Financial Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thanks, Peter. Brian, as you stated, we have about $5.3 billion of liquidity at the end of the third quarter. We are well capitalized. We're also very patient, and we are going to keep several billion dollars of liquidity always at the company for just prudently as we measure it. As we look through how we deploy capital going forward, we're going to be patient, balanced and consistent, right? And it's got to make sense for shareholders and for growing the company. And so I think that's the way to think about this as we go forward. As we stated in our remarks, we think about $1 billion of run rate as far as the share repurchase is a good indication for 2026, and I'll leave it at that.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nThat's helpful. And then second question, I'm just curious, I want to hit on your expense ratio target of 30% below. I'm just curious, given what's going on with the Everest transaction, which obviously is going to be beneficial to your expense ratio and these AI investments that you're making, which I'm assuming you're already seeing some productivity improvements from the underwriters. Is that 30% just kind of a starting point? And is there meaningfully more -- we could see improvement in that ratio?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nI'm not a big fan, Brian, of giving guidance on guidance. But I think to try to address the question is let me go with GenAI first. I do think that's going to give us a benefit in terms of growth and operational efficiency. But we just rolled it out to private not-for-profit, one of our smaller businesses. We're going to be sort of rolling that out to bigger business and do expect exactly what you outlined, but I don't really have exactly the time frame. 30% with Everest and other ways in which I think we can grow. We have the Everest conversion on the renewal rights. We have a whole account quota share with Convex. We think that organic growth is -- this quarter is not indicative of where we think we can drive organic growth. We are going to have some operating leverage. And our focus like the 10% to 13%, like the 10% increase in the dividend is to get to the 30%, and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate that and then we'll revisit what we think is the appropriate expense ratio for the business that we have at that time."

In other words, without getting too specific in numbers, how vulnerable are its earnings to what we think will be weakening pricing at 1/1?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nThey have a -- thanks, Meyer, for the question. They have a very diversified portfolio, balanced in insurance and reinsurance. Reinsurance is not just property, that's a percentage of their overall, but they're very prevalent in the specialty classes, casualty. They're like an exceptional underwriting group. I don't think that -- look, do they have property cat in the portfolio? Yes. But it's not -- if you look and compare and contrast it to like a Validus, which had significant property cat and was exposed to the big regions within the United States, it's apples and oranges. Also, in the U.K., companies are particularly like a Convex, very smart in terms of how they buy ILWs, how they buy cat bonds and how they reduce their overall volatility to a single loss. So I think, look, we look at it. It's well within our risk appetite for our own assumed property. And as I mentioned, we don't expect AALs to go up. And we will manage those exposures to have not big volatility, and it's not something I would be concerned about.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That's very helpful. And I just wanted to confirm that the renewal rights deal like is already active. In other words, that doesn't have to wait for any sort of regulatory approval for you to start looking at the renewal book.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nJon, maybe you could just give a very quick overview of where we are in terms of Meyer's question.\n\nJon Hancock - Executive (likely CEO of International or similar senior leadership) (AIG):\nYes. So it is active, yes, Meyer. There's one important point here that in the EU, we're in the process of seeking regulatory approval. And so when we get that, and we expect it fairly soon or we hope for it fairly soon, we're in active conversations. Everywhere else, this is live. And let's say, we are having active conversations with the brokers, the clients and with Everest underwriters and other folks to get this going as quickly as possible.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nWe are up and running, Meyer. We are working incredibly hard with the distribution and clients and showing continuity and a huge commitment to this portfolio."

The #1 question we've been getting for a while, and I'm sure it's up there on your list, too, has just been the pricing power environment in commercial insurance being softish or soft depending how one must define it and whether we, as analysts should start embedding some -- a bit of loss ratio degradation as a result into our models. And I know Peter, you've done a good job explaining to us in recent quarters kind of why you feel you're -- it's not a great -- that's not a great way to model. But any update would be helpful.\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. Thanks for the question. I have gone through it at length in some of my prior comments on these calls. And what I would think about as you're modeling whether it's rate, loss cost, all the different variables that drive combined ratio is looking at the mix of the portfolio is really important because large companies, in particular, like an AIG, we give you an index on rate, but there's so much that's underneath that. As Keith outlined, Casualty was strong, Property had headwinds. The difference between E&S and retail can be different depending on what's going on with the quarter, cyclicality. And then, of course, I think it's really important. We don't put out cumulative rate increases to be defensive on the current environment. We do it because we've delivered a significant amount of margin over time that gives us the ability to cycle manage. And I spent a lot of time like on Property with the cost of goods sold as to how you actually build up the loss cost. But yes, we're in a competitive environment. We're going through a shift. Property has been the one outlier this particular year. But I think it's a combination of a lot of factors. I still think it's a very profitable segment if you underwrite it well and you protect volatility. The other place that's seeing a little bit of price headwind is Specialty where we're sizable. But again, it has the same underlying dynamics, which has been very profitable, setting terms and conditions, being a lead underwriter, structuring opportunities for clients. You can see even in a market that has headwinds, flight to quality matters. We see new business up, submission count up. And I think you just have to differentiate between companies as well just to see who's going to sustain versus being an index in the market. That's some high-level commentary.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. And if I can ask a pivot to ask my follow-up on the update you gave us on AIG Assist and the exciting things you all are doing using technology and AI. Specifically on the submission response stats you gave out about almost 200,000 submissions year-to-date in one area of middle market. I just want to make sure we're thinking about this correctly and that over time, as this technology is deployed throughout the entire organization that it will likely result in kind of a material change to the top line revenue trajectory relative to market conditions. Is that fair?\n\nPeter Zaffino - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (AIG):\nYes. A few comments. I mean, of course, when we talk about GenAI, it could go in a variety of different directions. But what I would say is that we are focused on the example I've outlined in earnings and the example I've outlined at Investor Day is about getting more effective in digesting data and actually accessing more data points to make the underwriters more constructive and allowing them to make better decisions. So like when we talk about like the example I gave now with Lexington is that if you can ingest broker data faster and take unstructured, structured PDFs, all different formats and getting into an underwriting process and then have large language models accelerate that to the underwriter, that's why I said speed matters. I mean that's what will drive growth. And it's not about driving more like underwriting appetite, it's about getting to things that are within our appetite and being able to service that business faster and at scale. The other thing to think about is, are you prepared in a market turn? And it will happen. And so when there is parts of our business that there's going to be either supply issues or there's not going to be the same capacity, can you take advantage of those opportunities by servicing clients and brokers and scaling significantly? We are prepared to do that. And then the last comment I would make is that we are preparing this company to compete in the environment that's going to exist across the world. When you think about the technology, I'm not saying it because it's a sound bite of things are progressing over the last 6 months. This happens to be true. Like what's happening with like advancements in large language models or the orchestration in the future of agents that exist within organizations and different functions and different parts of underwriting, how do you manage through that? We are trying to accelerate implementation. So we're prepared for the changes that are happening at a rapid pace based on the capital expenditures from the large tech companies. And feel very good about what we've done, actually feel like we have advanced our guidance from Investor Day and want this to be a big part of how we talk about our business in the future. So it's going to be better quality data, more data sources, speed to execution is going to be accelerated and the underwriters are going to be able to make decisions faster and make more effective decisions. So that's where I want to be and feel very good about it. Okay. Thank you very much for the questions. I mean, as I said at the top of the call, it's been an exceptional quarter for AIG. The progress, the announcements that we made are just great examples of how we're moving the company forward with purpose and executing on our strategy. I'm incredibly proud of all of our colleagues. Without them, none of this happens. And so I want to thank all of my AIG colleagues for working at pace. And I want to wish everybody a great day. Thank you."

I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I will begin with a summary of the Hartford's first quarter results, then Beth will dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics. After which, we and our business leaders will be happy to take your questions. So let's get started. We are pleased to begin the year with exceptional results in our Commercial Lines businesses and continued strong results in Group Benefits. Well, industry-wide trends, such as elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, impacted our results. The first quarter also saw topline growth in Commercial Lines of 11%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%. Double-digit renewal written price increases across both Auto and Home in Personal Lines. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 8% combined with strong first quarter sales in a core earnings margin of 5.2%. Solid investment results with increasing fixed-income portfolio yields and strong reinvestment rates and a core earnings ROE of 14.3%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now let me share first quarter highlights from each of our businesses. We have strong momentum across Commercial Lines and I expect continued topline growth, at highly profitable margins. In addition, accelerating pricing in several lines combined with enhanced underwriting execution, bolsters my confidence and our ability to deliver margins consistent with the 2023 outlook I provided back in February. In Small Commercial, written premiums of $1.3 billion and new business of $242 million set new records for the Hartford. Three years ago, we completed the launch of our enhanced best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum. Over that three-year period, Spectrum written premium has grown significantly. For example, this quarter's written premium is nearly 40% higher than the same period three years ago and the new business premium is almost doubled over that same period. In addition, we've expanded wholesale broker relationships, our excess and surplus lines finding product continues to gain momentum, delivering robust growth. Written premium approximately doubled from a year ago, fueled by a substantial increase in new business. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver exceptional results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premiums in the near term. In Middle & Large Commercial, written premiums grew 10%, driven by new business growth of 23%, sustained exposure growth in solid renewal written price increases. New business submissions and hit rates were both up and average premium unsold accounts continues to increase. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines. The key area of focus and we will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions. We are committed to getting paid through the CAT in non-CAT risk we underwrite, setting appropriate terms and conditions, and ensuring proper valuations. Our investments in data science capabilities, industry-leading risk segmentation, and exceptional talent have contributed to healthy margins and position us well to continue driving profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty results, we're outstanding with nearly $4 billion of annual gross written premium. Our competitive position, breadth of products, and solid renewal written pricing drove a 10% increase in net written premium with significant contributions from Global Reinsurance. We are excited about our position in the wholesale market in the ongoing benefits from our broadening product portfolio. Execution has never been stronger and our enhanced underwriting capabilities are driving market share gains. Turning to pricing. Commercial lines renewal written pricing was 4.5% compared to 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding worker's compensation, U.S. Standard Commercial lines renewal written pricing rose to 8.1% with middle-market property pricing in excess of 10% and Standard Commercial Auto near 7%. Worker's compensation pricing remained positive, continuing to benefit from the stronger-than-expected average wage growth. Within Global Specialty, Property, Auto, Primary Casualty, and Marine, all generated strong pricing results well in excess of loss cost trends. In excess casualty, pricing is becoming more competitive, while public D&O pricing remains under pressure. Within financial lines, we have been shifting our focus to private companies, in management and professional liability, where market pricing and margins are more attractive while maintaining underwriting discipline in the public space. Across Commercial Lines, long-term loss cost trends in our book remained stable and excluding worker's compensation, the margin between renewal written pricing and aggregate loss cost trends has expanded modestly. As we continue to execute our strategy across Commercial Lines, I want to reiterate my confidence in our ability to manage the book through a variety of economic and market conditions, with superior underwriting margins and continued premium growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Moving to Personal Lines. The Auto loss cost environment is very dynamic, across market participants, the level of continued severity increases has had a meaningful impact on industry results. As a result, active management of rate filings in response to the changing landscape is paramount. We achieved renewal written price increases of 10% in the first quarter and expect it to accelerate into the high teens later this year. In the first quarter, approved rate filings averaged 18.3%, more than double, than the fourth quarter result of 8.3%. Given the vast majority of our book as 12-month policies, it will take time for the rate increases to fully earn in. With continued elevated loss trends reported in the fourth quarter o"

With continued elevated loss trends reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, we have adjusted our rate execution plan and as a result, new business rate adequacy will build throughout the year as filings are approved. We expect new business rate adequacy in most states by year-end. Overall, I am confident we have the right strategy and with focused execution, expect to achieve Auto profitability target in 2024 across the book. In homeowners, results were quite strong with renewal written pricing of 13.9% in the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpacing loss cost trends. Turning to Group Benefits. We are off to a strong start. Core earnings reflect a significant improvement. We have seen in mortality trends versus prior year, including decreasing impacts from pandemic-related losses. Lower pandemic-related mortality is a welcome and encouraging trend. While it is still too early to reach firm conclusions on long-term mortality trends, we expect they will settle above pre-pandemic levels in our pricing business accordingly. We continue to measure the effects of the pandemic and believe we are well prepared to adjust course, as necessary. In disability, our capabilities are market-leading and we remain positive on the performance and outlook of our book. Looking at new business, sales of $474 million were up $85 million over prior year. This was our second-highest sales quarter ever. Importantly, we're competing effectively across all market segments from small businesses to the largest U.S. enterprises. As a Group Benefits market leader, we are well-positioned to capitalize on rapidly evolving customer requirements for absence management, group life, and supplemental health products and services. We continue to strengthen our reputation for customer service with an extensive suite of tools for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification, and analytics. Employers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees, and our products and services are a key component of that value proposition. Moving now to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic objectives, while performing well across a range of asset classes and economic cycles. That will provide further details, Beth would highlight, it was another quarter of solid net investment income with negligible impairments. Recognizing that commercial real estate is topical, let me take a minute to comment on our approach to that market. We have dedicated teams of experienced professionals with a long and successful track record of investing in the commercial real estate sector. We believe the market provides attractive yields and risk-adjusted returns, while providing a source of diversification to our investment portfolio. We have approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, primarily consisting of multifamily and industrial holdings with less than 10% invested in commercial offices. We regularly review our property valuation for the impact of lower occupancy levels, higher cap rates and the impact of rising interest rates. These assessments, give us confidence, the portfolio will continue to perform well through the economic cycle. Well, perhaps a bit distinct from other property and casualty appears, we believe these holdings are an attractive alternative to investment grade corporate credit, as they provide approximately 80 to 100 basis points of additional spread over rated corporates. In closing, as we look ahead, we anticipate continued growth in strong margins across our businesses. Our financial performance demonstrates the power of the franchise. The depth of our distribution relationships and our commitment to superior customer experience and excellent execution by our 19,000 employees. With these competitive advantages, I remain confident that we can continue to deliver superior results. The Hartford has never been better positioned to deliver industry-leading financial performance, highlighted by a core earnings ROE range of 14% to 15%, while creating value for all stakeholders. Now let me turn it over to Beth to provide more commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $536 million or $1.68 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $436 million, with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%, in line with our expectations for the first quarter, which was embedded in the full-year outlook provided in February. Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.5%. The first quarter included higher non-CAT property losses compared to unusually low losses in the prior year quarter and in modestly higher loss ratio in worker's compensation as expected. This is the 11th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90%. Middle & Large Commercial delivered a record 89.9%, a 1.6 point improvement from the prior year due to favorable non-CAT property losses and expense improvement. Global Specialties underlying margin improved 3 points from a year ago to an outstanding 85.2%, which benefited from lower international losses and an improved expense ratio. In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was 187,000 with an underlying combined ratio of 97%. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 78.9% was in line with expectations. All results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by among other things, elevated repair costs, increased used car valuations, and a modest uptick in attorney representation rates. The auto underlying combined ratio was approximately 12 points higher than the prior-year quarter, which is about 5.5 points above our expectations. As we progressed through the first quarter, we began to see indications that there was a pronounced step change in loss activity. The first signal of this was in our February data and at that time, we did not view this as a sustained trend, but an area to watch. As we monitor loss activity in March, claim frequency remained in line with our expectations, but we observed additional pressure on claim severities for both the current accident quarter and accident year 2022. For example, with respect to our physical damage coverages, we observed a lengthening time to repair vehicles and an increase in the mix of total losses versus repairable. For bodily injury coverages, we continue to experience a mix-shift to more severe accidents. Taking all this data into consideration, we booked the current quarter at an underlying combined ratio of 105.1. We also recorded prior year development of $20 million related to accident year 2022, auto physical damage losses, which was primarily related to the fourth quarter activity. For auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as elevated activity in 2022 was offset by improvement in accident years 2021 and prior. As Chris indicated, the team continues to file for rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. The expense ratio decrease of 1.1 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spends. With respect to CAT, there were over 20 TCS designated events this quarter resulting in property and casualty current accident year CAT losses of $185 million, which includes the impacts from significant winter storms along the East and West Coasts and Tornado wind and hail events across several regions of the United States. Total net prior accident year development was essentially zero as reserve reductions in worker's compensation and package business were offset "

      "raw_bytes": "hail events across several regions of the United States. Total net prior accident year development was essentially zero as reserve reductions in worker's compensation and package business were offset by reserve increases in auto physical damage and general liability. Workers' compensation reserves were reduced primarily in Small Commercial, driven by favorable claim severity experience and a $20 million reduction in COVID-related reserves from the 2020 accident year. Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $90 million and the 5.2% core earnings margin reflect lower group life and disability loss ratios and growth in fully insured premiums. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter. So we would expect the margin to be lower than our full-year estimate. Earnings for the quarter benefited from a 12 points reduction in the Group life loss ratio reflecting improvement in the mortality trend as the prior-year loss ratio was significantly impacted by the pandemic. Also positively impacting earnings for the quarter was 2.8 points improvement in the disability loss ratio, due to favorable long-term disability incidents. Fully insured ongoing premium growth was 8%, reflecting growth from existing customers as well as strong persistency and new business sales. Premium growth also benefited from continued strong employment trends as well as our focus on enhancing the enrollment experience of our customers. Our diversified investment portfolio produced solid results, amidst Financial Sector volatility. For the quarter, net investment income was $515 million. Our fixed-income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 3.8% before tax, modestly higher than the fourth quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.5% in the quarter. These returns were slightly better than we had estimated as private equity annualized returns of 9%, partially offset negative returns in our real estate portfolio given fund valuations and the absence of underlying property sales as we expected. Looking forward, while it is still early in the quarter, we believe second quarter LP results will be similar to first quarter. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in real estate holdings and baking exposure, we have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. We have less than 600,000 in holdings in the three failed regional banks, primarily through index investing and we had no Credit Suisse AT1. As you can see in the disclosures provided, we own approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, which are concentrated in multifamily, industrial, and grocery-anchored centers with limited office exposure. Our portfolio is focused on high-growth geographic areas. Average LTV is 52%, and importantly, we have stressed our properties for lower valuations and are comfortable that the '23 and '24 maturities are manageable. We also own $3.3 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities. These holdings are secured by a diverse pool of properties with significant levels of subordination. We complete underlying loan level analysis for these holdings and also expect '23 and '24 maturities will be manageable. Turning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares for $350 million. As of the end of the quarter, we have $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. We recognize the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, but we are well-positioned to deliver consistent sustained industry-leading results. Our success is a direct result of our steadfast operational excellence. I will now turn it back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations (The Hartford):\nThank you. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, if you could repeat the process for asking a question?"

Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nYes, thank you. First question on guidance, I'm just curious. Personal lines, obviously, running pretty elevated above kind of where your range and guidance is, what gives you confidence, you're going to be able to make your guidance number for the year in Personal Auto? And then also on Commercial Lines, you're running above kind of the midpoint of the range, should we see the underlying combined ratio to continue to improve here going forward in Commercial?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nBrian, it's Chris. Thanks for joining us. I think you're asking questions about Personal Lines and Commercial and probably the implications overall. So what I would say, on Personal Lines its clearly, we're facing more headwinds than we anticipated a quarter ago. We've run various scenarios and I would share with you again Personal Auto. Is that -- if the elevated inflation severity pressures we feel in the first quarter continued in the second and third quarter. And then it begins to revert in the fourth quarter and that probably puts about four to six points of loss ratio pressure on the auto expectations we had for the full year. I think then on your Commercial Lines your question remained highly confident, highly. That we will achieve the objectives and targets set out for a couple of reasons; one, the earned premium impact is increasing and it will increase over the next three quarters based on what we've written, second half of last year, and then into this year. I think also if we've talked to you and others about the business mix that we're trying to shift. Obviously, more casualty, more property and that will have the opportunity to contribute to overall margin improvements. And then third is something we don't maybe talk enough about is just our underwriting initiatives to improve risk selection, improve our overall margins that is happening in all the businesses. Whether it'd be middle market and Global Specialty or small, so I think we have all the initiatives in place that will build throughout the year. Both on our loss ratio and our expense ratio, we didn't get additional leverage to that demonstrates and I see it in our numbers that we will achieve the goals that we set out for the year.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat, that's really helpful. And then Chris, I'm just curious, the reinsurance business, we talk about it much, but it's becoming a decent-sized business. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what's in that reinsurance book? Is it a property book? Is it a casualty book? How should we think about it, it will create some additional volatility you're going forward?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, I would have Mo maybe add his color, but I would say it's a diversified book, it's a diversified book of property and casualty. We've been in it, it's obviously up since we've acquired Navigators, it's a very thoughtful team, a very thoughtful approach. But it does contribute to growing our property, which I think we shared with you is a key initiative and Global Re this quarter basically grew its premium base over last year about 21% with 30% pricing improvement in property. So it's a U.S. book, it does have a little bit of global exposure. But I think it's performing very well and it's going to contribute.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Maybe you can talk about where you see that going over the course of the year. And also, is it still ahead of loss trends, because it just seemed like -- I think one of your competitors on the specialty side was talking about 8% loss trends in specialty, so I would just want to verify that.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I would say in Global Specialty, it's just got to take public company D&O out, because it's such an outlier and I don't than it give you a couple of data points, both in our international and domestic public company D&O public company books, which it's about $200 million of gross premium. I mean, rates are negative 20% or greater. So when I think, I've sort of our book and business mix in total. I'll give you another stat, it's in our investor slides that we put out there. But Commercial Lines ex-comp pricing is up 6.8%. But if I exclude the public company P&L that 6.8 goes to 7.7 and that's 7.7% is well in excess of our long-term. Cost of goods sold increases that we're expecting, so we still have a meaningful healthy margin, if you included. It's meaningful about 100 basis points and if you exclude public company D&O that probably goes up to 200 basis points of spread. So you put it all together and it is a pressure point, it's a small line of business. But that's why, you probably see that we're being very sensitive on how much we right, we're willing to let business go that doesn't meet our hurdle rates, which will impact the top line, but it will protect the bottom line.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

So Chris, you mentioned that you guys still expect to get back to your target margins in that business in '24. Obviously, you and everyone else in the industry is still seeing elevated trends to start this year or so why are you still convinced you can get there next year or is it just that in response to the trend you guys are pushing for more price than previously expected?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I would just add like high-level commentary and then ask Stephanie to add hers. But I think Elyse what you described and my words is simple math, right. We got loss trends that are remaining elevated, inflation is sticky, there are some severity pressure on totals versus repairable as Beth mentioned. But at the end of the day, even though it works on a lag effect, the data will support raising rates. And as we said, we've got 10 points of written rate in the book this quarter on a file basis, and approved basis in the states. We've 18.3%, so the cumulative effect of rate increases pruning the book, it gives us confidence that we can achieve our target margins in 2024. But Stephanie what would you add?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nChris. I think you framed it well. Elyse, our strategy remains unchanged at rate adequacy, focused towards achieving profitability in 2024 and our prevail launch. So the 10 points would you see sequentially over the prior quarters is a meaningful step-change. And again the rate, the 18 plus that we have approved those filings, it's truly a reflection of the rate that we're getting and how that will work its way through the book. And as Beth and Chris alluded to in their prepared remarks. What we observed in the first quarter has already been contemplated and put into our rate filings. So it's a dynamic process and one that we're working hard on every single day, but that gives us confidence.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my second question is on Commercial Lines. So you guys in response to a prior question pointed to earning in rate and there are some expenses that are going to flow through as well. Should we expect that the year-over-year improvement that you're looking for pickup, as we go through the next three quarters, meeting be the greatest in the fourth quarter as the rate continues to earn-in or is there any other seasonality we need to pay attention to when thinking about the back three quarters of the year?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I don't think there's any seasonality we need to pay attention to explicitly. But I do believe over the next three quarters, you'll see improvement in the loss ratio and the expense ratio. Given what we've talked about earned rate. Coming in business mix shifting for us. So all those will contribute to that improvement. Elyse, I think we've talked with you and others about our guidance. Remember, we guided to 87 to 89, we finished last year at 88.3. We believe based on the first quarter and the data that we're seeing for the next three that we will be able to improve from that 88.3 last year, whether it would be 3 times a point or 5 times a point, we don't have to debate that today, but it will improve and then, fundamentally driven by loss ratio improvement, expense ratio improvement offset by some of the headwinds that we feel in workers' comp. So those are the three main components of how we get to combined ratio improvement on an underlying basis from a -- from last year to this year.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

First one I had is little bit of a housekeeping item. When you guys mentioned higher non-CAT losses in commercial relative to the depressed level last year. How did those non-CAT losses this quarter compared to I guess a more normal expectation? I just wasn't sure whether to interpret that as higher than normal or not?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nNo. I'll add my color and I'll ask Beth to add hers. But I would say between small and middle right on expectation for the year. Small ran a little hot and Middle and large ran better than expected, but is there anything else there Beth that you would add?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nNo, I think you captured it well, as we again look at both small and middle little bit offsetting relative to little elevated in small Commercial and a benefit in middle market.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it and then my follow-up is on workers' comp. I guess, when you guys are thinking about loss trend there. It seems like you probably maintained a pretty high loss trend in line with sort of the 5% positive loss trend you've been booking. I just wanted to get some thoughts on the way that you're thinking through like frequency versus severity within that? And I mean, are you giving yourself credit for the lower frequency post-pandemic? The way that we've seen some of your larger peers there?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nSo, Alex. I think we've talked at year-end about frequency and severity trends. I would just reiterate. right in-line with our expectations. Maybe even slightly better on the severity side and I think we've talked about that. The trend on severity when we price for initially reserve for 5%. But last year and then continuing into this year, we're outperforming that. And we do have a frequency expectation that it will improve or a negative frequency, but we're not providing that data on a granular basis.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it, thank you."

Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nThanks, good morning. So, Chris, you spoke about the components of improving the underlying combined ratio and commercial in 2023 versus 2022. Any how we can see the expense ratio. So wanted to look at the underlying loss ratio here in the first quarter in-line with expectations with what you guys have out. I'm wondering, if you could talk about the different dynamics there between comp and then excluding comp, what's the year-over-year deterioration just all workers' comp or was there anything else in there? And it sounds like you're expecting a non-comp to pick-up and improve over the rest of the year. But just wanted to get a little bit more color on that.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, David, happy to talk through that. The best way we can. I would start by saying is year-over-year and compared to our expectations are generally right in-line, right. So if you want to quibble about a 10th of a point or two 10th of a point. Okay, but I'm not. And so again is always going to be put and takes, but from the year-over-year, we're offsetting the headwind in comp with other margin expansion in other lines of business. And it's sort of across the board and it's once in two 10ths here and there, but again that gives us confidence that, that we have the ability to continue that throughout the year, the rest of the year. And again I would just point out particularly in property. As we are really focused on growing our property book, and I think we've talked about it. We've got about $2 billion of commercial lines property book. We grew that first-quarter over first-quarter, as I said 18%. And if I look at pricing, particularly in our Standard Commercial Lines pricing is up 12%, wholesale is up 24%, Global Retail is up 30%. So we are getting a meaningful lift in property and that's going to mix in and will help the overall margins. I would say again, our general liability and casualty and specialty casualty lines, our industry verticals in certain areas are also running high-single digits to low-double digits with price increases, which will contribute. We are feeling a little pressure as I said in public company D&O and also a little pressure in our excess casualty book primarily construction. And I would say there's two primary reasons for that pressure both top line and then a little bit on pricing is, competition is moving in there and then there's fewer projects that's taking longer to get financing lined up for it. So it's a little bit of a perfect storm for some pressure there, but we're going to remain disciplined and try to protect our margins there. So those are the components, I put together, David. And I hope you were able to follow that.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYes, that was great. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a follow-up. It sounded like loss trend roughly stable in Commercial Lines and in the quarter. Obviously, a very dynamic environment especially on the liability lines side. Have you thought about any your expectations going forward? I think last quarter you had spoken about some expectation for property, severity, moderating towards the second half of the year. And then also just maybe talk about your sort of thoughts on liability loss costs, as we had through the rest of the year?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I don't think there's anything new to add, I don't actually -- I don't think I follow exactly what you're getting at. But all I would say is, our property book is $2 billion, I think it performs well, we're trying to grow it. As we grow it, we might have a little bit more volatility from quarter-to-quarter, just as fortuitous events happen, still feel good about our reinsurance protection in all our property, either per risk or aggregate basis. So it's nothing new to talk about in property Mo, unless you would add anything. Okay?\n\nMo Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial, Global Specialty (The Hartford):\nNo, I just say on liability we continue to and this is going back two or three years now, we've been working really hard on the segmentation and making sure we're looking at the right jurisdictions, thinking about attachment points, thinking about our limits management. So I think there's a pretty aggressive strategy that we use over the past couple of years to stay ahead of some of the trends that we're seeing now, which refers back to when Chris talks about underwriting initiatives, those are the types of things that he is talking about.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it, thanks so much. I appreciate it.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, David."

Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGood morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to your comments around D&O and the pricing being down 20%. Maybe Christian, while you can talk about, are there barriers to entry and D&O? I would have imagined for public companies, there is some component of switching costs if they go from one carrier to the next. And just as it relates to your position in the market, do you have the flexibility to come and go based on underwriting conditions, or does the business require you to stick with customers but perhaps at a reduced level of participation?\n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nYes, Greg. I'll start. Yes, I think what we've seen and I know several of our competitors have talked about it is the number of new entrants into this space, especially on an excess basis. At the same time, exposures have dropped away, whether that be spacks or D-spacks or just IPOs in general. I think it's important to note also that we as Chris talked about earlier, it's a relatively small part of our financial lines booking is -- the D&O is the $200 million that Chris referenced. And I don't think there is anything holding us in that market, we have been really working hard on risk quality day-by day-on risk-by-risk to make decisions as we decide which ones we will stay with and which ones we won't. But at the same time, we are also pivoting resources towards other parts of the financial lines book, like management liability, like professional liability, Small Commercial, Middle Market types of customers. So I think we're trying to be fairly nimble in the face of what is a precipitous drop in the public D&O market, but we see opportunities throughout that portfolio in other ways.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGreg. I would add is, there are differences in relationships on the primary side versus the access side. We're primarily access players and towers, you do have a little bit more flexibility to come and go, which as most said, it creates the opportunity for new capital and new entrants to come in. Let's see a little bit more stability on the primary side, but that's just my point of view.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nMakes sense. I'm going to switch gears, the Group Benefits business in your comments, you look at the results. I think you said second best quarter for new sales. Is this coming across the spectrum or are you gaining more share and a different component of smaller business, middle-sized businesses? And I guess, as I think about the outlook in the sort of step change in the market and your position in the market or is just -- or is there something going on with your distribution network that's giving you an advantage over your peers?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, Greg. I'll ask Jonathan to comment, but I would say. As I said in my prepared remarks. I mean, we're growing in all segments. Clearly, we're still recognized as a market leader in national accounts, that's probably 60% of our book, but we do want to continue to focus and grow in the other segments and improve our offerings there. But I think it's just the cumulative impact of what our brand stands for in this space and it's totally important today we're investing, as I said before. You're right. I think we're recognized as one of the premium organizations in the benefit space both disability life, all our supplemental products. And we're trying to take advantage of it, while remaining disciplined to get appropriate rates and returns for this book. But Jonathan, what would you add?\n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nChris. All the right points to start with on the conversation for sales, the national account business is fortuitous, every year is a bit of a different market, not every customer comes to market every year and so opportunities present in different ways at different times. We had a nice run on some national account business, which we're excited to add to our book. So that continues and we feel like we are a strong player in the large case market and we'll continue to compete there. But we are focused very much, as we work ourselves down into what we call regional accounts and then the smaller and mid-size enterprises. And I think we're seeing good success through our distribution channels there, number of our initiatives it's pretty well we've been focused on things like enrollment. I had a strong season last year, I think it's an intersection of benefits awareness and interest from employees and employers to add new lines, new coverages and to access those along with our improved enrollment capabilities coming online, really it's a great time to take advantage of that interest in helping us to drive more new sales in overall top line. So those things coming together along with a market cycle that worked well for us in National. I think it produced a great result here in the first quarter of '23.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGot it, all right, thanks for your answers."

I mean, I'm sure you and most analysts have done a lot of questions on that asset class. I'm now just curious, is there a scenario and appreciative that it's been a very profitable and remains a very profitable asset class, but is there a scenario where it would make prudent sense to ever hold back on capital management a bit, if stress and pockets of that asset class were to persist or get worse or that just you guys have had the granularity as it just not -- does that does not make makes sense given maybe the headlines are worse than the reality. Thanks.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, Mike. I'll would say, and I'll ask Beth to add her color is details matter, location matters, property type matters, experience with lenders or excuse me, borrowers and developer matters. So we're pretty confident in our ability to manage this through a cycle here that we're approaching and still have optimal flexibility with our balance sheet and capital, but Beth what would you add?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nYes, I would agree with that. I mean, we regularly stress all aspects of our business and evaluate our overall capital levels and take that into consideration when we execute on our share repurchases and so forth. And sitting here today, as you can see from our results, we're continuing on path that we've been on and feel very good with the overall strength of the balance sheet.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, great. And my follow-up, you guys have touched on this in prior calls, but the Small Commercial New business momentum has continued and any changing dynamics there that allowed Hartford to win even more is just kind of the normal, Bob that you guys are known for doing so well and any changing dynamics there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nI'll let Stephanie add it, but I'll just repeat what I said in my prepared remarks. Consciously, I mean, we built a new product with new technology. Amazon-like features, easy to use intuitive, both for CSR's and then our direct customers. So it doesn't happen by mistake, it's very intentional. As for what we're trying to achieve investing in. Particularly some of the latest developments in the excess and surplus lines. That we're going to attack quite aggressively in the marketplace. But Stephani what would you say?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nIt's a terrific question. It's a phenomenal franchise. As Beth stated 11 quarters in a row with a sub 90 underlying combined ratio, record-breaking new business growth, all lines growing, stable retention, strong pricing, ex-work comp and we're incredibly skilled at the workers' compensation line, successfully navigate historically through multiple economic scenarios. We really are the standard for ease accuracy and consistency in this space. And our agents have come to expect a seamless digital experience that values their time and provides the right coverage for their clients. So we just really believe, we have the winning formula for this space. Our greatest competition is ourselves and we're off to a tremendous start. And as Chris mentioned, we're pacing towards another milestone of $5 billion.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nIf I could, just a direct follow-up on this. You've mentioned E&S and I think the last couple of calls in regards to Small Commercial. Is that a new initiative like there or is that just happened open up a new TAM that for small commercial E&S like the likes of Kyndryl are in? Or just any color there would be great? Thank you very much.\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nSure E&S binding and small business, a terrific story, it's a wonderful and attractive addition to our overall franchise. And candidly, it's opened up another $7.5 billion of the addressable market for us and we're focused on growing the property and liability lines. We're very pleased with the results. It's a growing and accretive portion of our business and expect that to grow meaningfully over time. So it's a it's a terrific offering, we have tremendous wholesale relationships and it's just allowing us to be to create more capability and offering in the total small business universe. Thank you."

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. Last night, we reported strong financial and operational performance for the second quarter, completing a successful first half of the year. While we and the industry continue to navigate a dynamic market environment including elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, once again, we achieved exceptional results in Commercial Lines and outstanding performance in Group Benefits. Highlights of the second quarter include top line growth in Commercial Lines of 12%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 7%, with a core earnings margin of 7.6%. Strong investment performance with increasing fixed income portfolio yields and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 13.6%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders. These results only strengthen my confidence in our ability to deliver a 2023 core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%. Now let me dive deeper into our second quarter performance for each of our businesses. Momentum is strong in Commercial Lines. I expect continued top line growth at highly profitable margins during the second half of 2023, with full year underlying combined ratio targets unchanged. In Small Commercial, written premium of $1.3 billion and new business of $237 million continue near record high levels. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace. Spectrum new business premium of over $100 million was up 23% over prior year. Our unmatched ease of doing business with agents and customers and our unrivaled pricing accuracy and consistency remain important drivers as demonstrated by strong sales and retention and a 6% year-over-year increase in policies in force. In addition, written premium for our excess and surplus lines binding product eclipsed $50 million in the quarter, up nearly 60% from a year ago, with new business growth of just over 85%. Our expanding wholesale broker relationships are expected to drive continued robust growth and profitability for this important line. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver outstanding results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premium in the near-term. Middle and Large commercial had an exceptional quarter. Written premiums were at their highest levels ever, up 12% in the quarter, driven by strong momentum in new business with elevated submissions and hit rates along with increasing average account premium. Cross-sell activities remain in full force and are helping to drive new business results. Written premium grew across almost all lines with excellent growth in our construction, energy, and entertainment verticals. In addition, we are particularly pleased by the 24% top line growth in middle-market property lines, which remains a key area of focus and accretive part of this business. Looking across the enterprise, as discussed in prior quarters, we are taking thoughtful and disciplined steps using industry-leading tools to grow our property book within favorable market conditions. These efforts should put us in a position to expand commercial property written premium to approximately $2.5 billion or up 25% by year-end. Underlying margins in Middle and Large Commercial were also at record levels, reflecting advancements in data science capabilities, industry-leading pricing and underwriting tools and exceptional talent, all of which position us well to maintain profitable growth in this business. Global Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premium growth of 15% in the quarter. New business growth and improving renewal written pricing were important contributors. In addition, we remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and the ongoing benefits to the top line from our broadened product portfolio, U.S. Ocean Marine, Environmental, International, and Global Reinsurance all achieved double-digit top line increases. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities developed over the past few years are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past five quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal pricing of 5.2% compared to 4.5% in the first quarter. Excluding workers\u2019 compensation, renewal pricing rose to 7.5%, up eight-tenths sequentially with accelerating pricing in property and auto. Across commercial, property pricing is well into the double-digits with auto in the high single-digits, pricing in other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O pricing remains challenged. In addition, workers\u2019 compensation pricing remained slightly positive. All-in, our strong written pricing performance in Commercial Lines, combined with stable loss cost trends, bolsters my confidence in our ability to maintain or slightly improve margins going forward. Moving to Personal Lines. Persistent severity loss increases in auto have had a meaningful influence on overall industry results. We continue to respond with significant pricing actions. During the quarter, we achieved renewal written price increases of 13.8% and expect acceleration to above 20% by the fourth quarter. As loss cost trends emerge, we will aggressively push for appropriate rate actions. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.4% in the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. We are very selective and actively manage our homeowners\u2019 book at a state and territory level, diligently managing risk and growth with so"

We are very selective and actively manage our homeowners\u2019 book at a state and territory level, diligently managing risk and growth with sophisticated underwriting capabilities that allow us to effectively manage new business risk selection. A few examples of our risk management include the action we took many years ago to stop writing new homeowners business in Florida, a conservative stance on coastal CAT risk and wildfire mitigation efforts that have yielded strong outcomes. We are on the right path in personal lines, driving towards appropriate pricing and managing exposure and growth while continuing to serve our customers with award-winning service. In Group Benefits, I am pleased with both top line and bottom line performance, including an outstanding core earnings margin of 7.6%. Group disability continues to post strong results driven by favorable long-term disability incidence trends and claim recoveries. In Group Life, the loss ratio was up versus prior year. Mortality losses in the second quarter continued to run above pre-pandemic levels, but improved sequentially. Looking at the top line, growth was driven by book persistency above 90% plus strong year-to-date new sales. Overall, the strength of our diversified product portfolio as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, giving us a leadership position. Moving now to investments. I want to highlight another quarter of strong performance as fixed income yields continue to trend higher with solid credit results. Beth will provide further details. Before concluding, I would like to comment on the advances we continue to make in technology and the competitive advantage it brings to our businesses and distribution partners, along with a superior customer experience. At our Investor Day in November of 2021, I highlighted the significant investments we had made in our core technology platforms which were allowing us to extend our digital and data capabilities. Back then, we were already focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance execution, and today, AI is mainstream at The Hartford. The breadth and depth of our data and analytics and AI has grown into all parts of our business, and is enabling greater agility and faster decision-making while improving and streamlining the experiences of our customers and distribution partners. While some organizations talk about what they expect to do in the future, we are already doing this at scale. With several hundred AI models in production and driving business results, we believe our capabilities are leading-edge. Let me give you just one example of how we are already using what we call our information advantage, fueled by advanced analytics and AI to drive results. We developed an award-winning medical record digestion and extraction tool that has transformed the way we conduct our workers\u2019 compensation business. This tool ingest and translates medical records into digital content, characterizes the data and highlights relevant information. In workers\u2019 compensation, we are streamlining the adjudication process by suppressing 30% of the extraneous information contained in medical records that otherwise results in significant distraction or lost time to our claim handlers. Since inception of this tool, we have processed more than 500 million pages of medical records, and perhaps more importantly established a foundation for next level AI use cases across our business. When it comes to generative AI, we are actively experimenting with this technology in a highly controlled environment. Now, Hartford understands the potential of this technology and we believe we\u2019re at the forefront in piloting use cases that will augment the capabilities of our employees. All the transformational work we have done over the past three years or four years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market leading competitive advantage driven by technology, data science, in our experienced workforce. In closing, we have a unique portfolio of diverse yet complementary businesses that contribute to our industry-leading returns. As we have reached the mid-point of 2023, it\u2019s a good time to reiterate our strategic priorities that we believe will continue to drive our success. First, leveraging our product breadth and competitive advantage across the P&C and group benefits platforms will drive profitable organic growth. Second, underwriting discipline will guide a balanced risk profile supporting long-term book value growth. Third, we will continue to prioritize digital, analytics, and data science investments and enhance the customer and agent experience to improve underwriting and claims decision making. Finally, we believe ROE is the ultimate measure of quality underwriting, execution on priorities, and prudent capital deployment. As such, we\u2019ll continue to focus on exceptional ROE performance. We will continue to deploy excess capital in a thoughtful manner, prioritizing shareholder return and investments in future growth. Results over several successive quarters affirm that this strategy is working. With our strong track record, we are confident in our ability to deliver core earnings ROE in the 14% to 15% range. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $588 million or $1.88 per diluted share. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $493 million. Our commercial book posted a very strong quarter and first half of 2023 with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3 and 88.4, respectively. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7. The quarter included higher non-CAT property losses within our package product as compared to the prior year quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the entire book evidenced by the 12th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90. Middle & Large Commercial delivered both a record for written premium of $1 billion and an underlying combined ratio of 88.7. This was a 4.2 point improvement from the prior year, including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement. Global Specialty\u2019s underwriting margin was a strong 85, a 1.9 point increase from a year ago, primarily due to slightly elevated losses in a runoff line with our international book and a higher expense ratio due to a business mix in Global Re and higher underwriting and technology costs. In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $57 million with an underlying combined ratio of 101.7. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 79.6 was in line with expectations. Auto results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure. The auto underlying combined ratio was an 111.8 for the quarter, which is 11.8 points higher than the prior year quarter, and is 5 points above a revised expectations from April and includes 3 points related to losses in the first quarter. This increase to our expectations is attributable primarily to a higher than anticipated number of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims. For auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as increases of about $60 million for accident year 2022 was offset by improvement primarily in accident years 2019 to 2021. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the lost cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 13.8% and earned pricing increases of 8.5%. In homeowners, we achieved our highest written and earned pricing increases in over a decade of 14.4% written and"

In homeowners, we achieved our highest written and earned pricing increases in over a decade of 14.4% written and 12.7% earned with the second quarter. The expense ratio decrease of 2.7 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAT, the industry experienced another quarter of elevated losses resulting in our Property & Casualty current accident year CAT losses of $226 million, which includes the impact from tornado, wind, and hail events across several regions of the United States. And while catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. Our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk dates, helped limit our losses from confected [ph] storms in the quarter. Total net favorable P&C prior acting or development was $39 million with $38 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation and catastrophes were partially offset by modest reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and bond. In Group Benefits, core earnings in the second quarter were $133 million with a core earnings margin of 7.6%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. The year-to-date margin of 6.4% is at the mid-point of our full year range of 6% to 7%. The group life loss ratio of 84.1% increased 5.5 points versus prior year. Approximately 4 points of that increase is due to favorable prior period reserve development recorded in second quarter 2022. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher severity in the current quarter. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67% for the quarter. The expense ratio improves 70 basis points and reflects strong top line performance and expense reductions related to the Hartford Next initiative somewhat offset by the continued investment in new capabilities to meet our customer\u2019s evolving needs and drive greater efficiency. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $151 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $625 million. This combined with the excellent persistency Chris noted in his comments resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7% per second quarter. The economy remains quite resilient with solid employment levels and wage growth both of which continue to have positive effects on the business. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $540 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4% before tax modestly higher than the first quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.9% in the quarter. Results within the first half of 2023 were stronger than expected given the resiliency of private equity returns and we remain on track to achieve our expected full year 2023 target of 4% to 6%. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in the real estate sector, we wanted to provide an update regarding that portion of our investment portfolio, which remains consistent with what we discussed in our first quarter earnings report. As we mentioned, less than 10% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in office exposures, all of which we view to be top tier properties. During the quarter, two loans were fully repaid for approximately $90 million and manageable maturities are expected in the second half of 2023 and 2024. All loans remain current with respect to principal and interest payments with no delinquencies. CMBS holdings and credit quality are also largely unchanged given lower new issuance and limited trading activity. Our high quality non-agency CMBS portfolio is primarily conduit focused and has limited exposure to office loans. Holdings are supported by diversified underlying pools of property and have significant credit support to absorb individual loan losses with manageable near-term maturities. Turning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $350 million. At the end of the quarter, we have $2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our franchise is well-positioned to deliver consistent, sustained, industry-leading results. We believe that we have the strategies, talent, and technology in place to continue to succeed. I will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein - Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford):\nThank you, Beth. Operator, we have about 30 minutes for questions and we will take our first question."

Your line is open.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nHi, good morning. First one I had is just on the comments you made on property growth earlier in the commentary and I was just interested in, how your catastrophe budget and what you\u2019d expect from CAT loss as a shift over the next year. Certainly, the CAT performance this quarter is quite good, so I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how that\u2019s shifting, if at all.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. Alex, thanks for joining us. As we talked about improving and growing our property book and capabilities was paramount and I\u2019m pleased to report on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our property totals are up about 23% on a written premium basis. Pricing for the portfolio is up 15%, a couple standout data points there, large property is up almost 70%, with 18 points a rate, wholesale properties up 25% with 29 points a rate, and then our global reinsurance business is up about 50% of \u2013 with its property component and 30 points of rate. So you can see, I think we\u2019re executing well in an attractive marketplace and we feel good about what we\u2019re producing. I would just share with you that, we\u2019re not taking on consciously sort of CAT exposed property. I mean, we want broad-based property coverages, primarily the fire peril, and if it comes along with some incremental or limited CAT exposure, what will take it and price the CAT risk appropriately. So you should not think that this is a CAT play for us, but rather a broad-based property approach. And every year, we provide our CAT loads to you, we feel good about our CAT loads for this year, even with some slight elevation in the first half of the year. But that\u2019s what I would share with you, Alex.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. That\u2019s helpful. And then in commercial on underline, anything you\u2019d call out in terms of like normalizing items. I mean, I guess pretty squarely in your range that you guided to, but just trying to think through where our baseline is and how the acceleration in pricing can benefit underlying from here.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes, I will share with you and sort of reprise what we talked about in the first quarter, but at a high level summary, nothing\u2019s really changed from what we\u2019ve talked about in the first quarter. We still feel good about the guidance that we put out, we\u2019re executing well. And remember, the fundamental thesis of the improvement between years was loss ratio improvement, expense ratio improvement. And we were going to fight some headwinds in our workers\u2019 comp business. So all three of those components are playing out almost exactly as we\u2019ve foreseen. There\u2019s also \u2013 remember, we talked about an earned premium impact that it was slightly more leveraged on the second half of the year. So earned premiums will continue to increase through the compounding effect of rates. So I still see that and expect that in the second half of the year. The second point we talked about was a mix more towards property and other lines that have just lower loss ratios that would mix in \u2013 to help improvement. And the third thing that, again, we see every month when we review results with the team. Our underwriting initiatives and how we\u2019re looking at terms and conditions in a thoughtful way continue to produce a loss ratio benefit. So you put all that together, it is still what we believe will emerge on a full year basis. To your specific point, Alex, on any unusual items in the quarter, I would say, there\u2019s probably five-tenths \u2013 excuse me, five-tenths of a point or a half a point in total headwinds, primarily from the non-CAT property losses that Beth talked about. We had favorability in middle, had some offsets in small, and then we have a runoff line of business aviation war in our international book. That business has been runoff in the last three quarters, but we did have $5 million of losses there. So I put those two pieces together and I would normalize a full half a point off of what we printed right now.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

And then what I would say, Michael, on comp, obviously we have a lot of data points, we operate in all 50 states. But generally our medical severity trends are consistent with what we talked about in the first quarter and lower than the 5% that we assume in our pricing and reserving. I\u2019d say they\u2019re probably 50% lower at this point in time. Obviously, we\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s happening with broad based medical CPI, but we\u2019re somewhat insulated from that. And we\u2019ve talked about the reasons before, whether it be contracts on a state by state basis, our ability to challenge appropriate medical bills that are established to us. And remember, we \u2013 our biggest component of medical is usually physician visits and we\u2019re not paying for a lot of hospital stays and really big medical procedures. So it\u2019s behaving very well. But we do keep an eye out for it for any changes or adjustments we need to make.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):\nOkay, that\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up just on lost cost trends on the \u2013 more on the commercial side, not on the personal line side. It\u2019s good to see there\u2019s been a some pricing momentum for Hartford as well, but just curious if loss costs are also inching higher and cognizant there\u2019s still probably a good delta between pricing above loss trend, but curious, we\u2019re continue to see a bit of reserved deficiencies for many in commercial auto and GL and I don\u2019t think Hartford\u2019s been fully immune to that. So curious, if lost cost trends also kind of maybe inching higher too.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nWell, you\u2019re right to say that generally lost cost trends have had or our pricing has had a healthy margin above trends and that trend continues here into the second quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with the margin. And I would say for us, again, given our book of business, which is geared towards small and middle market enterprises. Our lost cost trends have been fairly consistent. So I don\u2019t see anything in aggregate, that is putting too much pressure on our trends at this point in time. So I would just say they\u2019ve been consistent, Michael.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO):"

I would say, it was a net headwind. That\u2019s what I said about that 50 basis points or half a point of higher than expected property, non-CAT property losses and then if you put the aviation war losses that we booked in there and that\u2019s in the international vision, not small or middle. That\u2019s the 50 basis points of pressure I would normalize out.\n\nMike Ward - Analyst (Citi):\nGot it. Got it. Thank you. Maybe on personal auto, just curious \u2013 do you feel like the pricing that you\u2019ve gotten in the quarter, was it what you expected? Is there \u2013 is it more difficult with the regulatory environments or is it just severity is just higher than expected?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nWell, where do we begin? Again, if I look at how we thought about how the year was going to play out is totally different honestly. I think the level of inflation pressure, the stickiness of it particularly in physical damage is just overwhelmed many industry participants. So then the BI component, the severity ticked up a little bit for us. We had a little bit more uninsured motorist claims this quarter. So it is just really been a challenge. What I would say on the positive side though is we\u2019re getting rate, teams pushing really hard for rate that we could just file and use or use and file in those states that we need to get pre-approval. We\u2019re working the system as hard as we can. Both Beth and I talked about the rate increases that we got in this quarter, and we expect to have a written rate increase of 20% by the end of the year. And I suspect once we plan for 2024 will probably be in that range of written rate need in 2024 to get the book \u2013 back to target profitability. But when we put it all together, it\u2019s overwhelmed our judgments and estimates, our judgments turned out to be too light. As we\u2019re halfway through the year and if you look at really what we printed on a six month basis, we\u2019re probably eight points above our guidance for the full year. And that\u2019s probably a minimum of where the full year\u2019s going to come out at this point in time. But again, the positive news I want to leave you with and the optimist side is we\u2019re executing well on our rate plans. We\u2019re really proactive with making the needed adjustments in a timely fashion. And that will continue into 2024 aggressively to get our book to target profitability probably in early 2025 now.\n\nMike Ward - Analyst (Citi):"

Chris, maybe building off of that last comment, because that was going to be one of my questions on personal auto recognizing, right, that\u2019s obviously been a hard business line for everyone in the industry. So when you say you\u2019re going to get back, potentially back to target profitability in early 2025. Do you envision needing double-digit rates between now and then? Or how are you seeing price and severity trend playing out over the next year plus?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes, with respect to sort of our prior views, I\u2019m going to sort of hesitate to forecast too much just given how just dynamic things are at least. But what I would share with you two important points. We do expect in the fourth quarter written rate increases in the book about 20%. And again, an early view into 2024 from a written price side is probably in that general range and vicinity. We still see the stickiness in inflationary pressure on physical damage. And we\u2019re still cautious on what the BILLION, particularly the BI trends will be and then now the uninsured motorist trends, given where rates are most likely. So it\u2019s hard to predict. But as we sit here today, we think we need back to back years about 20 points of rate increases in 2023 and 2024 into the book to get us to a place to be in a position to have targeted profitability in early 2025.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks, Chris. And then within commercial lines, in response to Alex\u2019s question, right, you confirmed right that the year\u2019s kind of trending as expected. You did highlight, right, some unearned rate in the book. So is the right way to think about it that there could be a tailwind on the loss ratio just from that rate earning in, in the back half the year, especially if loss trend is stable, like you said?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. Yes, I do believe the compounding effect of rate increases will increase. That\u2019s what our math shows particularly in the second half. So, yes, I think you\u2019ve got that right. Plus then the mix change and then the underwriting initiatives, and then we\u2019re still forecasting improved expense ratio in the second half of the year. So those are all the pieces, Elyse.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

Chris, Beth and team, maybe we can go back to the success you\u2019ve been able to register in your commercial business from a new business production perspective. And I was struck by your comments around small business spectrums growth. I think you called out E&S binding as another area of strong growth. And I\u2019m curious about the effect of large numbers where incremental growth becomes more challenging. So how do you think about market conditions as you look not today and what you\u2019ve just reported, but you look going out into 2024? Do you feel like the customer strength is substantial enough that you can continue to put up these type of numbers? Or is there the potential that they could slow down if the economy sort of adds?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. No, I would say, and I\u2019m going to ask Mo and Stephanie just to talk about what they feel in the market, market conditions and their ability to execute. But clearly, I believe through the end of this year and into 2024, I think will be a market environment that is still robust from a rate in terms and conditions perspective. I think particularly in the property area, broadly defined commercial property, homeowners property. And then if you look at some of the casualty lines, particularly commercial auto and some of the longer tailed liability lines, I think it\u2019ll be a conducive environment to grow and maintain or slightly expand margins going forward. So I\u2019m pretty bullish on the next 18 months, but Stephanie first and then Mo, what would you say?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nSure. And small commercial from a macro-economic perspective, we continue to see signs of a healthy economy, unemployment\u2019s low, new business starts and the small commercial space continue to be strong and still better than pre-pandemic levels. We still see strength in overall exposures. So we do not see any meaningful change more of the same. We\u2019re really pleased with the quality of our submissions and our submission flow. So I feel very positive in the quarter. We grew policies in force in every single line. And as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, our agents, our distribution really respond to our overall business model. And then finally, I would add in the E&S small commercial binding space, very, very pleased with our results. We continue to see this to be a growing and profitable part of our business. And we apply the same rigor and analytics to that book that we do to our admitted line, and we\u2019re really writing the business on our terms and price. So I\u2019m very pleased with our execution and our position in the market.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nMo?\n\nMo Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial (The Hartford):\nGreg, maybe I\u2019ll take the two pieces. So for middle and large commercial, I think submission activities up, so we feel good about that and then that continuing throughout the course of the year. And then what\u2019s exciting, I think is a lot of the capabilities we\u2019ve been putting into market over the past couple years are, we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to grow scale there. And Chris highlighted three in his script, talked about construction, energy, entertainment. So these are the verticals in middle and large commercial that we think on the back of that submission activity, we hope that the growth can continue through year end. And then similarly for global specialty, the growth is broad based and that gives me great confidence for our ability to maintain it.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nAnd Greg last point, I do think the E&S market will continue to be a market that\u2019s attractive from a risk return perspective and ultimately a pricing side. So, again, I see the E&S market remaining healthy over the next 18 months.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nFair enough. That\u2019s good detail. I wanted to pivot for my second follow-up question to your comments around technology. You spoke about Generative AI, you spoke about the initiatives ongoing at the company. And then I\u2019m looking at the Hartford Next slide too. So I guess what I\u2019m curious about is just the view on technology spend inside the organization seems like there\u2019s always a lot more projects that you could spend money on, but you have to exercise some discipline. So can you talk to us about how you expect the budget for technology spend to evolve over the next 18 months or so?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. I\u2019m happy to just give you high level commentary. Obviously, we will plan appropriately over the next three year on time horizon. But I would say, the Hartford Next program actually helped fund a lot of the investments that we continue to make today. So Beth, I would say, it\u2019s been a successful program. It\u2019s nearing its end. We do have a continuous improvement mind set. So there will always be opportunities to reduce expense and create greater efficiency, while continuing to invest thoughtfully in the next-generation of technologies. Broadly defined, Greg, I mean, we run sort of a constrained model. Everyone needs to compete for capital with appropriate IRs on their projects over a multi-year period. And that\u2019s generally how we do it. I think we\u2019ve shared with you, we do expect a significant structural savings over a longer period of time, particularly as we take all our data and applications to the cloud. We\u2019ll move about 100 apps to the cloud this year. Our Global Specialty business is completely in the cloud right now with all its business and data and apps. And that will generate meaningful savings. I would say probably Beth more 2025 and beyond because there is a little bit of an upfront invest. So yes, I\u2019m really proud of the team and how thoughtful they are on creating the business strategies and then the linkage to technology to create that differentiation for us in the marketplace.\n\nGreg Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

And also on that, are you seeing any difference? I know it\u2019s really new, but any difference in the prevail experience versus your legacy book?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nI will \u2013 I\u2019ll add some commentary and then maybe I\u2019ll ask Stephanie to add commentary. Brian, I would say we feel good about our data and analytics that we have deployed. But again, the inflationary pressures here is time to repair is wages in these repair shops. There\u2019s just a lot of pressure on the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it the economic system. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise or anything that is sort of unusual that you could sort of detect with trend lines. It\u2019s just more expensive to repair cars these days because they have more technology in them and there\u2019s been more severe accidents. It\u2019s driven by higher speed, and then you put the labor constraint onto it. So that\u2019s what I see. I think our claims team does a fine job, a good job. We got a network of claim specialists that we use that helps out our economics that if to stay in the network. So our customers and our claim handlers are incented to stay within there, but there\u2019s freedom of choice of where a customer would want to get their car repaired too. So that\u2019s what I would say, Stephanie, but what would you add?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nI agree with your point on the claim from a prevailed perspective. A couple of additional points I would make, one, we\u2019re live in 22 states and we\u2019re going to roll out, we\u2019ve been rolling out additional four in the month of July. It\u2019s a small portion of our total book because as you know, it\u2019s new business. We are very pleased with the attributes and the quality of that business that we\u2019re writing. It is meeting our expectations. And then the third piece that I would share is as we move forward, as you know, we\u2019ve built that on a six-month auto chassis. And so our ability to continue to get rate and get it in at a bit faster clip is also assisting not only now in this environment, but over the longer term. So overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the business that we\u2019re writing.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Even though you\u2019re seeing stability on loss trends, what kind of margin you\u2019re building for stuff you\u2019re not seeing now, but maybe on the horizon, like you already spoke about seeing medical severity below your pricing reserving assumption. Any color and stuff like social inflation arise in latent liabilities and claims frequency reverting back it feels like it\u2019s down post pandemic.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. Tracy, I\u2019m appreciate the question. Obviously, we pick a loss trend that contemplates a lot of the stuff that you talked about. So I can\u2019t break it down by product line for you. But just know that. When we pick trend, particularly by line of business, particularly within GL, it does contemplate a lot of the social aspects that you talked about litigation financing is always top of our mind in some of these areas. And then you look at particularly terms and conditions and things that we\u2019re just not going to be exposed to. The classic example is what we\u2019ve done with pollution over the years with asbestos how you exclude that on an absolute basis even the PFAS chemical these days. There\u2019s exclusions in our policies for those types of exposures again going forward. So again, I think our team is thoughtful from a risk side in trying to manage those long tail either mass tort exposures that you, I think you\u2019re referring to.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nI\u2019m curious, when did you put that PFAS exclusion in your policies? What year?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nI would say four or five years ago. It\u2019s for those \u2013 Tracy, it\u2019s for those industries where we think we have the exposure, there might be implicit exposure there. We started in the beginning part of 2022.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nOkay. Would you think that pollution exclusion in GL is broad based enough that it could include PFAS?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nWhat I would say in PFAS is obviously it\u2019s nothing new. We\u2019ve been monitoring the exposures for many, many years. All the known exposure we have and discussion with our clients is included in our evaluation quarterly for reserving, and we make adjustments as we deem necessary. And also part of our A&E cover that we\u2019ve done with national indemnity, the pollution portion of PFAS, not the bodily injury portion, but the pollution portion is available to be seated to that cover.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nAwesome. Just a really quick numbers question. It looks like personal auto your [indiscernible] decline year-over-year sequentially that makes sense given all the price increases. Why then is your retention going up? Is that a timing difference or something else?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nYes. The honest answer is it\u2019s \u2013 obviously it\u2019s a calculation. Some of it could be influenced by our six-month policy trend versus 12 months. But I\u2019ll have Susan follow-up with you on the details of the calculation.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):"

Obviously, we talked about the pressure we\u2019re seeing in personal auto, so it sounds like you do have some offsets or areas where you\u2019re \u2013 you think you\u2019ll be better than original guidance. I realize you don\u2019t really like talking or updating guidance over the course of the year. But would be curious as to where you are seeing \u2013 where you\u2019re more optimistic relative to your original targets?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nWell, Yaron, what I would say is, there\u2019s a lot of good things that are happening across the platform. Two of our biggest lines are performing well and probably better than we expected workers\u2019 comp and disability. If I look at our investment portfolio, as far as yield maybe slightly above where we planned. I think that\u2019ll contribute. I think there will be a normalization of our non-CAT property losses that we talked about. We\u2019re out of the aviation war business, so that tail should be less impactful. So I put those components to there. And even with the ongoing pressures which I admit are continuing longer than we thought in personal lines. Personal lines is still a relatively small business and its overall contribution to ROE will be muted by it\u2019s just by its size. So we continue to buy in shares, that we find attractive from a valuation side. So those are the component pieces I would share with you Yaron.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. I appreciate it. And I would just note that I think the two larger businesses as of today, at least first half of the year, seem to be tracking in line with full year guidance. So I guess it would suggest further improvement or maybe in some cases even significant further improvement from here?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (The Hartford):\nI\u2019m going to resist talking about the future much more than I typically would.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nFair enough. And then maybe a quick one for Beth. I think new money rates have actually been coming down the last two quarters if I look at Slide 13 of the presentation, can you maybe talk about that?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (The Hartford):\nSure. I think it\u2019s kind of mixed, as you said, it\u2019s been coming down from December. And one thing I would just point out is that when you think about our investment from portfolio. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve not made any significant changes in how we think about asset allocation and so forth. But in any given quarter what we\u2019re purchasing can change a bit. So if we look at where we are in second quarter versus first quarter and fourth quarter a little bit lower in duration, a little bit higher in credit quality. So that mix can sometimes have an impact on how you just look at the sequential. What we\u2019re really pleased about is the differential between our reinvestment rate and the sales and maturity yield still very healthy, and that contributing overall to the improvement that we\u2019ve seen in the fixed maturity yield.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

I'll now turn the call over to Chris. \n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. The Hartford's third quarter financial and operational performance builds upon the momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Once again, Commercial Lines and Group benefits, which in aggregate represent over 85% of earned premium delivered exceptional results. We continue to expand our strong competitive position, successfully executing on priorities and delivering superior returns for shareholders.  Let me now call your attention to highlights from the third quarter. Top-line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Strong pricing across P&C including double digit increases in Commercial Property, Personal Lines, Auto and Home. Group benefits fully insured premium growth of 8% with a core earnings margin of 9.8%. Strong investment performance with reinvestment rates, climbing to 6%, driving higher portfolio yield and the trailing 12-month core earnings are already of 14.9%. These results are outstanding and keep us on track to deliver a full year core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%.  As I look across the markets, the U.S. economy has remained resilient in recent data points, including robust payroll, strong retail sales, in solid levels of industrial production point to an environment, which continues to be supportive of the Hartford's businesses.  Now let me dive deeper into the third quarter performance by business. In Small Commercial, written premiums were $1.2 billion with 16% growth in new business and another sub-90 underlying margin. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing new business premium of approximately $100 million, up 20% over the prior year. In addition, written premium for excess and surplus lines grew 34% in the quarter with new business growth of over 50%. We expect E&S premium to approach $200 million for the full year.  I am incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, which continues to deliver outstanding results with industry leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. This business is poised to exceed $5 billion have written premium this year.  Middle & Large Commercial had another great quarter Written premiums grew 5% reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth in our excess lines. Our general industries properties book grew 13% while large property grew 15%.  Looking across Commercial Lines, we are taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to grow property premium within favorable market conditions to the level of approaching $2.5 billion for the full year or a 25% increase. We are focused on managing our CAT exposure, as evidenced by our year to date CAT losses, which were lower than our market share.  Coming back to Middle & Large Commercial, underlying margins were exceptional, reflecting the advancements made in data science capabilities, pricing, and underwriting tools. Margin has also benefited from favorable property losses. Those advancements combined with our best-in-class talent position as well to sustain profitable growth in this business.  Global Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premiums up 11% driven by new business growth and strong renewal written pricing in a number of key lines. Submission flow in the U.S. was up 11% in the quarter, including 15% growth in wholesale and international saw strong new business growth in marine and Energy.  Within renewal written pricing, momentum has been building in the wholesale access market. Property pricing has been above 20% all year, and international casualty is above 10%. In addition, we remain excited about the ongoing benefits to the top-line from our expansive product portfolio. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities, developed over the past few years in Global Specialty are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past six quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger.  Turning to pricing, Commercial Lines' renewal written pricing was 5.4% flat with the second quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose to 8% up four tenths sequentially with strong pricing in Property, Auto and General Liability. Across Commercial property pricing is over 10% with Auto and General Liability nearing that level as well. Pricing and other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O is still pressured. In workers' compensation, renewal written pricing continues to exceed expectations, remaining slightly positive in the quarter.  All in ex-comp renewable written pricing and Commercial Lines remains on top of last cost trends, reinforcing my confidence and achieving our margin expectations for the year. In summary, momentum persist in commercial lines, where I expect top-line growth and highly profitable margins to continue.  Moving to Personal Lines, I am pleased with our continued response to elevated loss cost in both Auto and Home. In this challenging environment, our focus, objectives and execution are unwavering. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 20%, which we expect to continue at that rate into the fourth quarter. Current accident year lost trend expectations for the third quarter, as updated in June, held a promising development as we finished the year.  In Homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.1% comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit pricing increases "

This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit pricing increases in this book. Our focus on the preferred market within Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering prevail.  This product will be available in 39 states by the end of this month. And we are optimistic about future prospects for growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve Auto new business rate adequacy in over half the states representing two thirds of new business premium. I am confident in the pricing actions we are taking will return this business to targeted profitability in 2025.  In Group Benefits, premium growth of 8% and a quarter earnings margin of 9.8% were both outstanding. Core earnings of $170 million was a quarterly record, reflecting focused execution, improved mortality trends, and continued strong disability results. This quarter's disability loss ratio reflects historically low, long-term disability incidents, trends, and favorable claim recoveries.  In Group Life, mortality trends have improved both sequentially in year-over-year, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. Looking at the top-line, growth was driven by book persistency above 90%, plus strong year to date sales. Overall, the strength of our Group Benefits, diversified product portfolio, as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position.  Before I turn the call over to Beth, let me share some takeaways from the recent Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers Annual Conference. Throughout the course of the 60-plus meetings in touchpoints at CIAB, we heard a consistent acknowledgement of the strength of our franchise. Partners called out our unique digital tools, broad product set, the strength of our innovation agenda, and the consistent execution of our strategy over a number of years. They also expressed their desire to grow their business with us, and they have come to view our team as best-in-class with relationships that have never been stronger. Confirmation from distribution partners that we are delivering on our strategy is strong validation of our leading position in the market.  Through those relationships combined with enhanced capabilities, state-of-the-art technology and digital tools we are taking market share while delivering industry-leading returns. With that track record, I am confident in our ability to consistently deliver core earnings ROEs in the 14% to 15% range.  Now, I'll turn the call over the best to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello  - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $708 million, or $2.29 per diluted share. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter with core earnings of $542 million, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7, which includes some elevated non-CAT property losses. This is the 13th consecutive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of below 90.  Middle & Large commercial delivered another quarter of written premium over $1 billion and an exceptional underlying combined ratio of 88.1. This was a 5.6 point improvement from the prior year, including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement.  Global Specialty's underlying margin with a strong at 4.3, a 20 basis point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to lower loss ratios in Global Reinsurance and International Lines partially offset by higher loss ratios in U.S. financial lines due to public D&O rate pressure, and marine driven by a couple of large losses, as well as higher policyholder dividends in bonds due to the strong profitability of the book.  In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $8 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99. Homeowners' underlying combined ratio of 78.1 was in line with expectations. The Auto underlying combined ratio was one 108.5 for the quarter, which is consistent with our expectation from second quarter. Importantly, we made no adjustments to loss picks from the first half of the year and prior accident years.  As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 8% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.7% and earned pricing increases of 11.7%. In Homeowners, pricing increases of 14.1% on a written basis and 13.7% unearned. The expense ratio improved by 2.9 points, primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAT, P&C current accident year catastrophe were $184 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $293 million in the prior year quarter, which included Hurricane Ian losses of $214 million. Although CAT losses were elevated for the industry again this quarter, our results were in line with our expectations as we believe that our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline has helped to limit our losses from the increased number of convective storms. Total net favorable prior accident year development was $43 million, with $46 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers' compensation and package businesses were modestly offset by reserve increases in general liability. Moving to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the third quarter were $170 million with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67.3% for the quarter down 1.1 points from prior year. The Group Life loss ratio of 80.2% improved 2.9 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. The expense ratio improved 1.4 points and reflects strong top-line performance and expense efficiencies, somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers' evolving needs and drive greater efficiency. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $143 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $768 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 8% for the third quarter. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $597 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates, and we continue to be pleased with the positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.1% before tax, slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect the full yield excluding LPs will be about 80 basis points higher than the prior year. Looking forward to 2024, we anticipate another 25 basis points of improvement based on the current yield curve, which will contribute to about a $200 million before tax increase in investment income excluding LPs. Our annualized LP returns were 6.3% in the quarter. Results during the first nine months of 2023 reflect the resiliency of our private equity return and the absence of any real estate equity sales.  The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A plus. This maturity valuation decreased as a result of higher interest rates. Net credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments remain insignificant, along with an increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio.

      "raw_bytes": "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Meredith  - Analyst (UBS):\nHey, good morning. Chris and Beth, a couple of questions here. First one, I just want to dig in a little bit on the Commercial Lines premium growth. I was a little surprised at the slowdown that we saw in the Middle Market's premium growth considering which some other companies have been reporting this quarter.  And then the Small Commercial side, I know you had a difficult comp there but also a slowdown. Maybe we can unpack it a little bit, and anything unusual going on?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nBrian, thanks for the question. I think just the context here, just if you look at sort of year-to-date results just on written premium in small, up 10.3%; middle, 8.8%. New sales in small, 21%; middle, 12%. So those are results we're really proud of and pleased with, particularly at the profitable margins that they're producing. I would say in the second quarter, there's two main themes that we discussed as a management team, and I'll let Mo add his color, is we're remaining disciplined on price and underwriting. And if we're not going to get the terms and conditions that we expect, we'll let the business go. And I think that happened more times than not in the -- particularly in the July time period.  And then I would say that the overall exposure growth is still positive, but it is moderating, evidenced by lower audit premiums on a sequential first half of the year basis. So again, still positive exposure growth, but not as robust as it was early in the year. But Mo, what would you add?\n\nMo Tooker  - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nYeah, Brian, I would say that just to reiterate, we feel really good about the year-to-date growth of the 12% on new. But as you see in the quarters, can be lumpy. And maybe a little bit of context there. We equip our underwriters with tools by product, by specialty area and then they are in the market executing on those. And sometimes, in some quarters we do -- and especially periodically see months where the market is just going further than we would go.  So I feel like our underwriters made really good decisions in the quarter and you especially see those months at the beginning of the quarter when the market really heats up a little bit periodically. But broadly, I think the underwriting team did a nice job. And right now, these months are more of an exception, but we're watching that closely.\n\nBrian Meredith  - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Chris, second question. I know we've chatted about this before on conference calls, but a fairly large TPA out there talked about medical cost inflation and workers' comp of 7% to 9% is what they're seeing in their business right now. Is that what you're seeing? I don't believe that was the case. And how would that kind of play into your comp results?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. Happy to sort of comment on that, but there's a -- not going to be anything new I'm going to share with you. I think again in the context that our workers' comp is a highly profitable line of business. We haven't made any changes in frequency or medical assumptions since we set them at the beginning of this year. So things are actually running almost exactly as we predicted.  Medical severity, as we've talked about it, what we price for and collect and put up on the balance sheet is 5%. Actually, what's emerging for the first nine months is slightly less than that in the 2% to 3% range. I would say though that if I look at trends last year, nine months, this year, nine months, medical severity is probably up a little bit, say, a point. But I don't think there's any trend to call out other than just sort of maybe normal volatility.  We watch all our components of price, whether it be hospital stays, whether it be physicians, whether it pharmaceuticals. And generally, things are behaving as we expect. So I don't know what to tell you other than it's steady as she goes from our perspective as we sit here today. I think the impact on the longer term is still to play out. But as we've talked about before, Brian, I mean, our claims team is world-class. We have fee schedules in place, networks in place that sort of provide a buffer. And if long-term, things continue to be elevated, the reaction function within our system, I think, will allow us to raise prices and deal with it appropriately.  So I don't think we're going to get surprised in any way, shape or form on medical severity running away from us.\n\nBrian Meredith  - Analyst (UBS):\nAnd I would expect your loss control probably helps you relative to the industry as well, right?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. Clearly, we've got a lot of capabilities embedded in claims, embedded in our Engineering Group, so yes. And again, being the second largest rider, you would expect us to have those capabilities.\n\nBrian Meredith  - Analyst (UBS):\nYeah, thank you. Very helpful."

I was wondering just with the growth in property, how should we think about your non-CAT property volatility going forward? And like has the range of outcomes on your underlying loss ratio, why didn't it change materially?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nMike, thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we're trending towards $2.5 billion of commercial property premium across our businesses, which would be about a 25% increase from prior year. And we feel very good about how we're executing both from a growth and pricing side.  I'll give you just a couple of numbers for the third quarter here. In our Spectrum property component. Our growth was 13%, and pricing 11.5%, up. In our general property in Middle Market, growth was 13% and pricing was up 12.9%. Large property grew 16% with pricing up 16% also. So I think, in total, we're executing very well. We grew property 12% this quarter with pricing up 14%.  And as I said before, I mean, this isn't a CAT strategy. I mean, we'll obviously take on a little CAT, but we're looking at other perils, particularly the fire, to build a national book of more property exposure. And I think we're getting paid for that incremental volatility from quarter-to-quarter. I would say the story line this quarter, particularly with non-CAT commercial property losses were, in total, at expectations and about a point better than prior year with elevated losses in small commercial, offset by lower losses expected in Middle & Large. So I think our strategy as well.  And Mo, I don't know if you would add anything as far as the execution or any color from the marketplace, please.\n\nMo Tooker  - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nYeah. We just continue to build a talent base. We're attracting people just based on how we're going about going after property. The tool set continues to improve. And we're talking retail and wholesale here. We continue to see an opportunity, rates generally hanging in there. Terms and conditions are hanging in their deductibles are improving. So I think broadly, we feel really optimistic about our ability to continue to chase the market.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nStephanie, what would you add in Small Commercial property and any E&S color?\n\nStephanie Bush  - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nYeah. I think you framed it well from the Spectrum perspective, is that we experienced some volatility. But as you referenced, we've taken rate not just recently, over many years, to stay at or ahead of loss trend for the property portion of our above [ph] product.  And as Chris stated, it's double digits in terms of what we accomplished in the third quarter, which is higher than our longer-term property trends. And I will remind everybody that we did have our 13th quarter in a row with an underlying combined in the under 90%. From an E&S perspective, E&S binding, which continues to be a growing and profitable portion of our book of business, strong risk selection, achievement of 30 points of property rate in the quarter and growing. So all in, really proud of how -- the team's execution.\n\nMike Ward  - Analyst (Citi):\nAwesome. Maybe on Personal Lines real quick and the seasonality. Just wondering, should we expect the typical pressure in 4Q? Or do you think the rate that you're pushing can actually maybe mute that seasonality?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. So I'll take that, and this is Beth. In Personal Lines and if we break it out between auto and home, in auto we'd expect fourth quarter to be higher than what we've seen year-to-date and probably in that sort of 6 to 8 point range. Where it comes out will really be impacted by just where loss trend goes.  On the other hand, home, typically, fourth quarter is more favorable than the year-to-date usually by 5 to 6 points. And we'd be expecting that again this quarter.\n\nMike Ward  - Analyst (Citi):\nThanks, guys."

I hear you on how you feel about the profitability of the business, and certainly, the reserve development has been great. I guess just helping us think through the NCCI sort of indications are pointing down another mid-single digits. And you mentioned, I think, the 5% loss cost trend.  So how should we think about the margin drag that, that creates going into next year? I mean, can you help us think through -- like even just relative to the headwind that you got from that this year, does it get worse? I mean, there's also a sort of a moving target in terms of the baseline that you sort of start off with when you do that math. So I just -- any help would be great.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nAlex, I hate to disappoint you but we're not going to talk about next year at this point. We'll talk about next year once we finish this year and what we see. But you're right, I mean, there is going to be continued pressure coming from pricing. But I think the setup is going to be very similar to this year.  As much as there's pricing pressure, frequencies will, I believe, continue to improve. We'll pick our same medical severity most likely in that 5% range but knowing that it's performing better. We've been able to out-execute on our rate plan this year, which is providing a modest benefit. So there's always the opportunities to outperform a rate plan in spite of what the NCC is putting out.  And again, you still put all the math and the mechanics together, it's still going to be a profitable line of business for us in the industry. And I think it's very manageable from our point of view, at least heading into 2024.\n\nAlex Scott  - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. Second question I had for you is just on the ROE range you all talk about. I mean, you're sort of hitting the upper end of it right now. And Personal Lines isn't making money right now, and with the rate you're taking, it should start to again. And then investment income, you talked about being a bigger contributor next year. So when I think through all that, I hear the ROE guide and I'm sure -- look, you're not going to adjust your long-term targets. It's going to be periods that you're earning more or less than the target potentially. But is that the right way to think about it that, that is a longer-term ROE guide and that you're not suggesting that there's some offset to those things necessarily and that we may go through a period where you're over the top end of it?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nI think you got it right. We've said about our franchise, we're becoming more consistent, more predictable in all our businesses, whether it be Property & Casualty, whether it be group benefits. Personal Lines is going through a tough slog, but we do see a return to profitability in 2025 there. So yeah, the range is the range. We've added the word consistently to that range. It's not a limit. We'll try to overachieve and outperform that. But I think that is -- that 15 is particularly a good anchor point, plus or minus. And we're going to always try hard to outperform and do our very best.  We are sensitive just to a little bit of rate fatigue that may or may not be happening in the marketplace with customers and agents and brokers. I think we've educated people well enough over the years, Alex, at least from our perspective, on the components of loss cost trends and why we need to continue to be disciplined with rate, whether it be commercial auto, whether it be property, whether it be GL, with all the factors that have been discussed by many over a long period of time. So I think that still puts the industry in a conducive place, particularly as we head into 2024 with particularly a rising yield environment and investment returns coming through the portfolio.  So yeah, you put it all together, and I still think that's a good range, but it's not a limit for us to try to outperform.\n\nAlex Scott  - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

If I look at Page 21 of your supplement, a nice step-up in ROE over the last several quarters. Can you remind us of what kind of economic sensitivity that business has? Because there's obviously some noise in the marketplace about what the economy might look like next year. And then secondly, when I look at the results in -- particularly in the third quarter, wondering if there's anything you want to call out, unusual good guys that helped that boost the number higher. Thanks.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGreg, I'll start and then I'll ask Jonathan to add his commentary. Yeah, you're right to point out the 13.8% ROE. Very proud of that. Obviously, mortality is trending back to normal, which is providing a tailwind.  I would say, though, mortality on a year-to-date basis is still maybe slightly ahead of our expectations but again trending in the right way. And we've talked about it for a while that we're trying to put additional rate into that life insurance book. And the team, I think, is executing well in the marketplace. The other thing I just always like to convert is that 13.8 GAAP ROE probably translates into a 17% tangible ROE on a tangible basis just given some of the goodwill that we've added with acquisitions over the years. So on a tangible basis, it is a meaningful contributor. Earnings power is getting back to what I think would be somewhat normal. The investment performance will contribute.  So I think it's a stellar business for us. It's one of the industry leaders. It's growing nicely in conjunction generally with economic conditions, whether it be employment, payroll gains. The disability claims function that we have is, I think, world class. We've added new capabilities with our voluntary product suite and the number of paid family leave components.  I could go on and on because I think it's a valuable business that people should look at maybe a little differently than it's valued today. But Jonathan, what would you add from an overall performance side and a trend?\n\nJonathan Bennett  - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nThat is a terrific overview, Chris. So a lot of agreement with all of that. I think, Greg, you asked a bit about some of the economic drivers, and that often gets ascribed to the LTD line linked with employment levels. Obviously, right now, unemployment at very low levels. Certainly, that is contributing, we think, to some of the performance of the business. The outlook right now around unemployment, not something that we see as being a real negative drag into the future. Even if levels were to increase, there's always a bit of a delay between when we see that and if there is going to be any effect on LTD. But even that effect, we would say, is pretty loose in terms of its linkage. It's not a hard connection. And we think that even if unemployment levels were to increase moderately, we're probably still operating at attractive levels. So things seem to be in good shape on the LTD side. Your other point about in the third quarter, as Chris outlined, solid net investment income, pleased with that result. The mortality is probably one of the more notable things for us. We've had sequential improvement over the last four quarters, that's been terrific on mortality. But this quarter, we got down to a level that we think of as being more in line with endemic state post pandemic. And so we're pleased to see that. We'll watch that one again in the fourth quarter, but that bodes well for the business moving forward. And then on the disability side LTD, again, incidence levels pretty attractive at this moment and our claims team is doing a phenomenal job around recovery. So we think our expertise there is really coming through. One of the things about The Hartford is we understand medical management whether that's comp or LTD, and we think that comes through in our execution on both sides of the organization. So really pleased with that outcome. Where that trends in the future, I think we'll continue to monitor and obviously adapt ourselves quickly as necessary, but we're pretty pleased with the performance of the business year-to-date.\n\nGreg Peters  - Analyst (Raymond James):\nThat makes sense. Thanks for the detail on that. I guess as my follow-up, I'll pivot to the Personal Lines business. And what I was interested in is that if I look at your prior accident year development table, where we're seeing other companies report adverse development inside Personal Lines, we're not really seeing it at The Hartford. So maybe you could spend a minute and just talk to us about why your trends are maybe a little bit different from some of the others that are reporting problems in terms of reserve development, that is?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. So I'll start. So first of all, in Q3, as we said in our remarks, we did not make any adjustments to prior accident years for the auto line, for auto liability or auto physical damage. If you -- I'll remind you, if you go back to the first half of the year, in the first quarter, we did record about $20 million related to physical damage for the 2022 year. And also, in the first quarter and second quarter, we increased our estimates for auto liability for the 2022 year, but those were offset by releases for years '21 and prior. So that's why that development on a net basis is not showing up in that table.  So we were experiencing some of the same trends that others were seeing. We reacted to them. As I said, we are very pleased that in the third quarter, our loss picks for prior accident years as well as the first half of the year did remain unchanged.  And the last thing that I'll just point out on that, because I know some have looked at sort of our year-over-year results in auto. And I'll just remind you that because we have booked prior year development for the '22 year in '23, when you look at that third quarter reported underlying loss ratio for auto, it would probably be about 4 to 5 points higher reflecting some of that PYD we've seen. So hopefully, that helps some people who are looking at sort of that year-over-year comparison in the underlying auto ratio.\n\nGreg Peters  - Analyst (Raymond James):"

One thing that was a big change in your is the GEICO really improved a lot in their margins and, at the same time, they churned a significant portion of their book of business. One of the things that you're looking for to improve profitability long term in the AARP business was the opportunity to non-renew customers who shouldn't renew.  To what extent do you think there's a solution in your profitability, a combination of non-renewing customers as opposed to achieving through rate alone?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nJosh, it's Chris. I'll start and then I'll ask Stephanie to add her color. Again, we're very proud of the AARP relationship for over the last 35 years. I think you will recall, we did renew a contract and extended it to 2033. Part of that then, we launched the Prevail product and platform. But the in-force business, both auto and home, it does have lifetime continuity agreements still on, on the policy that prohibits us from just canceling a customer unless their risk profile, particularly in the homeowners' line, really changed. That's different with Prevail, but that's going to take some time to sort of work its way all into the in-force business. Because 90% of the business that we still have on the books, it relates to lifetime continuity agreements. So we have to be sensitive there. That's why we're pushing for rate as aggressively as we've had. And I think Stephanie and the team, the numbers and the results speak for themselves, and that will begin to earn in.  But Stephanie, what would you add?\n\nStephanie Bush  - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nNo, I think you framed it really well, Chris. When you think about really where our focus, Josh, is, it's responding to the loss trend environment. You see that materializing in our rate actions. We're also deploying our Prevail products, 39 states and market as of today. About 50% of our new written premium is on the Prevail product but that is a very small portion of our in force. So just to go back to underscore, Chris' comment on the overall in-force, and share of that does have the lifetime continuation endorsement and then the preponderance of our in-force book being 12-month policies takes time for that rate to earn in. But wholly focused on bringing this book back to profitability.\n\nJosh Shanker  - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd when we look at that new business, is the rate increase is similar between what's going through on the Prevail book and what's going on in the lifetime continuity book?\n\nStephanie Bush  - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nYeah, absolutely. What I would share with you is that on the in-force book, you see the written rate. The rate has to earn in. But as we've shared in previous calls, we also look at new business rate adequacy. So when -- what is the rate level of new business? And we expect, based on all of our actions that more than half of our states by this year, by year-end, will be new business rate adequate. And that makes up about 65% of our new business volume. And so again, that gives us a degree of confidence in terms of continuing to market to drive in new.  So you have to think about new business being rate adequate given all of our rate actions. And then on the in-force, that book is going to earn in that rate overtime.\n\nJosh Shanker  - Analyst (Bank of America):"

Excluding workers' comp, are you surprised at all that commercial pricing has continued to increase? Any thoughts on how we should think about pricing into 2024 once higher reinsurance costs are through the system? And we're seeing some declines in certain core CPI gauges.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nHey, Jack, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll have Mo add. No, I don't think there's any surprise. I thought I tried to address it that just given the environment, I think the continuation of rate being disciplined reinsurance costs are probably increasing. All point need to be disciplined on rate and work with our distribution partners and customers to make sure they understand why, so that there can be an element of explanation back to the end customer. So I see more of the same as we head into '24 at this point in time. But Mo, what would you add on the commercial side?\n\nMo Tooker  - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nYeah. No, I would say that the reinsurance market feels fairly stable, fairly predictable. So I think that's getting priced in ahead of renewal dates. I would say, second, the rate environment is still pretty conducive. We think it's constructive and we think that will continue.  And then third, again, I talked before about we have months periodically where we just think the market is competitive. It just is lumpy that way. And oddly right now, October is feeling really good. And so just things bounce around a little bit, and that's just -- we're going to be really disciplined about it, but we're looking to grow in a really responsible fashion.\n\nUnidentified Analyst - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Your 19.7% pricing increase for personal auto is a great achievement. I'm not really hearing that pricing level from your peers. So just to get grounded, are you including exposure in there? And if you are, how does auto exposure act like rate?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nTracy, I would add some commentary and then ask Stephanie. But my commentary is going to be more on commercial just so you have that. It's somewhat unique in Personal Lines auto, home. Home, we talk about the rate that we're achieving both includes pure rate and ITV, which we think works in tandem. But I think we disclosed -- I know I talked about it in my prepared remarks, ex comp, our renewal written pricing was 8% in the quarter, up four tenth.  And I would say the component of exposure that acts like rate there, yes, I think you could think of it as basically 2.5 points, 2.6 points to be precise for one third exposure and then two third sort of net rate.  That's on commercial. And I would ask Stephanie to explain to you the auto.\n\nStephanie Bush  - Head of Small Commercial and Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nHi, Tracy. I think about personal auto is largely the rate, and I appreciate your comments. Really, our results that we were able to realize, and from a rate perspective, is largely driven by the loss results are evident and they're fully supportable in our filings. We have strong relationships with the regulators and then it was just truly outstanding execution by the team.  But if I take you over to homeowners, how Chris described it that is a combination of both rate and then what we're seeing in terms of the inflationary factors. And you bring those two together, and that gave us the 14.1.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nOkay. Yeah, it was more on personal auto. I appreciate that. In Group Benefits, specifically to stability, could you see yourself being more competitive on pricing at one-one renewals, given what you said historically low long-term disability incidence trends and favorable claims recovery? \n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nI'm going to have Jonathan add his commentary, but the market is pretty competitive and pretty efficient. So I don't think we have to make a conscious decision to be more competitive on price. We have our targets. Obviously, we'll reflect new disability trends, both incidents and terminations for that cohort. We do expect a reversion to the mean there, Tracy. So that will put some upward pressure on pricing just from where we are today.  But I wouldn't say there's a conscious mindset at 1/1/24 to do anything different than we've been doing in the past. But Jonathan, what would you say?\n\nJonathan Bennett  - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nI would agree with that, Chris. I think that's the outlook that we bring to the market. We can talk about when we look forward into 2024, we find the market to be competitive all the time. I don't feel as though there's any particular change in the nature of competition in the market. And for us, a fair portion of our book is upmarket, larger accounts, and there's credibility in the data often by account there. And so we're looking at those trends on an account-specific basis and have been doing that, continue to do that. That's the way we compete in the marketplace. And so I think that we factor all of this insight into those selections.  So I don't think there's any particular change. And if the underlying question is, is this a moment of drop pricing and to grow aggressively? That's not the outlook The Hartford brings really in any of its lines of business. So the discipline is there. It remains there. And our efforts are to continue to grow the book profitably and to make sure that we take care of our clients in a world-class fashion.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):\nAnd you did mention reversion of the mean. If you had a crystal ball, when will you see that happening? \n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nWe'll tell you when we get there, Tracy. \n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Barclays):"

I think a lot of investors are honed in on those years specifically, and what you're seeing there for lines like GL and like maybe financial lines as well.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. I mean, as it relates to the quarter, as I said, with a very small amount of relative increases. I think if you go back and look at over the last several quarters, you've seen us take some increases in GL lines. And I'd say a lot of that has been in those years that you are indicating. And we take that experience into consideration as we think about our loss picks and pricing for those lines going forward. So I don't really have much more color to add to that, Yaron, unless there's something else specific you were looking at.\n\nYaron Kinar  - Analyst (Jefferies):\nI guess, and maybe this is becoming a little too granular for a call, and I apologize if so. I'm just trying to hone in on specifically those years and understand maybe the net numbers that you're talking about are actually a larger gross loss from those years, offset by maybe some favorability from other years.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYeah. I mean, there can be some back and forth. I wouldn't call out anything significant on that. I mean, on our more current years, especially on lines like GL, we do tend to hold our loss picks longer. We definitely through several quarters had seen some improvement that we recognized on the 2020 year. But again, nothing that significant that I would call out.\n\nYaron Kinar  - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. And then the other question I had was on the Navigators book. So I think at the time of the acquisition, the U.S. casualty book was about 40% of the business.

I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which are simply stellar. Then I'll turn the call over to Beth to dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics, after which I will close our prepared remarks with a review of expectations for 2024. We then will be joined by our business leaders as we move into Q&A. So let's get started. The Hartford is pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, capping another outstanding year of financial performance and achievement of our strategic objectives. These results demonstrate the power of the franchise and in particular, our superior underwriting execution, depth of distribution relationships and unmatched customer experience. I am grateful for the commitment, dedication and hard work of our 19,000 employees who show up every day to deliver for our customers, partners and shareholders. Let me call your attention to some highlights for both the quarter and the year. Top line growth in Commercial Lines was 9% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 86.6%, and growth was 10% for the year with an 87.8% underlying combined ratio. We achieved strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter and for the year, including notable double-digit increases in commercial property, personal auto and homeowners in the quarter. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth was 6% for the quarter with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, and growth was 7% for the year with a core earnings margin of 8.1%. We delivered strong investment performance with an 80 basis points increase in the portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships for the full year. All these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading core earnings ROE of 15.8%. Now let me share a few details from each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business completed its third straight year of double-digit top line growth and underlying margin expansion. Written premium growth of 10% for the year was driven by meaningful exposure growth, pricing increases across most lines and strong new business growth in each of our three businesses. As expected, underlying margins improved 0.5 point as slight headwinds in workers' compensation were more than offset by earned pricing, exceeding loss cost trends across the rest of the portfolio and by improved expense leverage. Small Commercial remains a highly profitable growth engine for The Hartford. 2023 included record-breaking annual written premium of $5 billion and a decade-long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios. Spectrum, our best-in-class package product, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing to annual new business premium growth up 20% over prior year. I\u2019m incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, a business we expect will sustain outstanding results with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. The performance has also been truly exceptional. Our team has improved annual underlying margins by approximately 10 points since 2019, while adding over $900 million in written premium at a 7% compounded annual growth rate. In 2023, written premiums grew 9%, reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth. Submissions, quotes and the hit rate are all up over prior year as we leveraged advanced underwriting capabilities, particularly within the low end of Middle Market. The stellar results in this business are a direct result of data science advancements, pricing expertise and industry-leading tools. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we are well positioned to sustain profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty, advanced underwriting capabilities and continued discipline are driving targeted market share gains with excellent underlying margin performance that has hovered in the low to mid-80s for the past seven quarters. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove an 11% increase in net written premium for the year, including 33% in our Global Reinsurance business and mid double-digit growth in U.S. professional liability and international marine and energy. New business growth of 7% for the year and 20% for the fourth quarter was driven by significant increases in both submissions and quotes and wholesale. Renewal written pricing continues to accelerate in wholesale excess casualty, and property pricing has been above 20% all year. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across Global Specialty with execution that has never been stronger. Looking across Commercial Lines. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines, a key area of focus. We will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions with a thoughtful and disciplined approach. Property written premium of $2.5 billion for the year was approximately 20% higher than 2022. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written pricing was 6%, an increase from 5.5% in the third quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose four-tenths to 8.5% with strong property pricing at 11%, auto closing in on double-digits and many liability lines in the high single-digits. Public D&O pricing remained pressured, although the fourth quarter result was the lowest pricing decrease since the second quarter of 2022.

All in, ex comp renewal, written pricing in Commercial Lines remains comfortably on top of loss costs trends in the fourth quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines produced an exceptional quarter, closing out a very successful 2023. Moving to Personal Lines. I\u2019m pleased with our continued progress to address elevated loss costs trends in both auto and home. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 22% and new business rate adequacy in over half the states, representing two-thirds of our new business premium. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.7% during the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Our focus on the preferred market within the Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering, Prevail. This product and platform are currently available in 41 states with additional states coming online in 2024. Turning to Group Benefits. We had an exceptional year, delivering record core earnings of $567 million and an outstanding core earnings margin of 8.1% and strong fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7%, demonstrating focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. 2023 disability loss ratio of 67.1% reflects low long-term disability incidence trends and favorable claim recoveries. In 2023, group life mortality trends have improved, though they remain above pre-pandemic levels. We expect the Group Benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear road map that I\u2019m confident will only strengthen our market leadership position. For example, building on our historically strong presence in national accounts with an enhanced approach for small to midsized employers, we view this as a key strategic initiative, leveraging our unique expertise in these markets. In addition, as we have discussed before, we struck a partnership with Beam, a dental and vision company to expand our product offerings for small to midsized employers. Overall, the strength of our Group Benefits diversified product portfolio, our commitment to outstanding customer experience using data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $935 million or $3.06 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 15.8%. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter and year with core earnings of $723 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. And an underlying combined ratio of 86.6 for the quarter and 87.8 for the year. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8 compared to 87.5 in the prior year fourth quarter. For the year, growth was 10% and the underlying combined ratio was 88.6. Middle & Large Commercial delivered its third straight quarter of written premium over $1 billion with 11% growth and an underlying combined ratio of 90.3. For 2023, growth was 9% with an underlying combined ratio of 89.3 compared to 92.1 in the prior year. Global Specialty\u2019s fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 82.9 and for the year improved 30 basis points to 84.3. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $36 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99.5, including a strong homeowner\u2019s underlying combined ratio of 67.3. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 113.5 was better than our expectations due to lower auto physical damage losses. This result is an improvement of 5.1 points from the fourth quarter of 2022 once that quarter is adjusted for the adverse development recorded in the first half of 2023 related to the fourth quarter of 2022. Also, I will point out that during the fourth quarter of this year, we made no adjustments to loss reserves for prior accident years. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the lost cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium and personal lines increased 12% over the prior year driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 21.9% and earned pricing increases of 15.5%. In addition, we received approval for an 18.7% rate increase in California that was effective in January. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.7% for the quarter and 14% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 10 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing cost. With respect to CATs P&C current accident year catastrophes were $81 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $135 million in the prior year quarter. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $102 million, primarily concentrated in commercial lines as reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation, catastrophes and bond were partially offset by reserve increases in assumed reinsurance and commercial auto liability. We completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $194 million comprised of $156 million for asbestos and $38 million for environmental. All of the $194 million was ceded to the adverse development cover. The increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the cost of resolving asbestos filings and a modest increase in the company\u2019s share of loss on a few specific individual accounts. The increase in environmental reserves was mainly due to higher estimated site remediation costs, including an increase in the estimates for PFAS exposures. After taking into consideration this year\u2019s study, as of December 31, we have $62 million of coverage remaining on the A&E ADC and a deferred gain of $788 million. For our Navigators ADC, We have previously ceded the full limit of $300 million, of which $209 million has been recognized as a deferred gain within other liabilities. In 2024 we expect to start collecting recoveries on the ADC and as a result, amortization of the deferred gain is expected to begin in the first quarter. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million pre-tax, with the remaining balance amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings. Before turning to Group Benefits, I would like to review the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Overall, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our program. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed at an approximate 5% decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information, compares favorably with the overall market and speaks to the quality of our book of business, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience. There were some minor changes in the treaty that provides coverage for certain loss events under $350 million, but overall the structure of our property CAT program did not change significantly. Additionally, we secured another $300 million layer on top of our program through a combination of traditional reinsurance and sponsorship of a catastrophe bond. The addition of CAT bond protection furthers our goal of securing diversified, strongly rated protection that affords durability in both cost and availability. The majority of our occurrence protection is secured on a multiyear basis. As "

The majority of our occurrence protection is secured on a multiyear basis. As of January 1, we have protection up to a gross loss event of $1.4 billion. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and terms with favorable pricing from a risk adjusted perspective. You\u2019ve heard Chris reference our strategic growth in property writings. These changes ensure a consistent level of protection in keeping with that growth. We have summarized these changes in the slide deck and in addition to our property catastrophe program, we also successfully renewed several other reinsurance treaties that experienced limited changes in terms, conditions and rates. Moving to Group Benefits. We achieved record core earnings of $174 million for the quarter and $567 million for the full year. Core earnings margin of 9.8% in the quarter and 8.1% for the full year reflects strong premium growth, improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 63.6 for the quarter improved 1.9 points over prior year, reflecting continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries. For the year the group disability loss ratio improved 1.2 points to 67.1. The group life loss ratio of 83 for the quarter improved 6.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. For the year the group life loss ratio improved 3.9 points to 83.5. The expense ratio improved 0.8 points for the quarter and 1 point for the year, reflecting strong top line performance and expense efficiencies somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers evolving needs. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $71 million contributed to a full year sales total of $839 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 6% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter net investment income was $653 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates and we continue to be pleased with a positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships was 4.3% before tax, 20 basis points higher than the third quarter. Looking forward to 2024, we are expecting 15 to 20 basis points of improvement reflective of the current yield environment. This increase combined with portfolio asset growth is expected to contribute approximately $135 million to net investment income before tax, excluding LPs. Our annualized LP returns were 7% in the quarter. Full year 2023 LP returns were 4.8%, reflecting the resiliency of our private equity portfolio, which helped offset the slightly negative returns in the real estate equity portfolio. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Fixed maturity valuations increased in the quarter as a result of lower interest rates and tighter spreads. Net credit losses, including intent to sell impairments remain insignificant along with a modest increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio. All of our mortgage loans continue to be current with respect to interest and principal payments. Turning to capital. As of December 31 holding company resources totaled $1.1 billion. For 2024, we expect total dividends from the operating companies of approximately $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the first quarter. As of year-end, we had $1.35 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. To wrap up, 2023 business performance was strong and we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Chris.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, Beth. Let\u2019s now pivot forward. Strong fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning us to sustain these results in 2024. In Commercial Lines with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to build market share at highly attractive margins. We expect total renewal written price increases in Commercial Lines, excluding workers\u2019 compensation to be consistent with 2023. Workers\u2019 compensation and renewal written pricing, which is composed of net rate and average wage growth is projected to be flat to slightly negative. We expect underlying margins to be consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting while sustaining industry-leading results. While we anticipate slight headwinds in workers\u2019 compensation, earned pricing is projected to remain on top of loss costs trends across the remainder of the Commercial Lines book. Turning to Personal Lines. We expect annual renewal written pricing in both auto and home to be consistent with the fourth quarter results. In auto, as a result of the significant written pricing actions that will earn into the book combined with moderating severity trends, we expect meaningful underlying loss ratio improvement of five to six points during 2024. Earned pricing in home is expected to remain above loss costs trends. As we navigate this inflationary period across Personal Lines, we are focused on balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity. Overall, I am confident we have the right execution plan to return this business to targeted profitability in 2025. In Group Benefits, we expect the 2024 core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this business. In closing, let me summarize why I\u2019m so bullish about the future. First, 2023 financial results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and the ongoing investments in our business. In particular, underlying margins in Commercial Lines were excellent with meaningful top line growth, and we produced record core earnings in Group Benefits with strong premium growth. Second, Personal Lines results have stabilized. We are achieving necessary rate increases and expect 2024 margins to improve towards our targeted profitability. Third, we expect our book of diversified, but complementary businesses will continue to sustain superior results. With our outstanding underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to outperform. Fourth, investment income remains strong, supported by rising yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets. And finally, in the last three years, we have returned $6.2 billion of capital through repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to proactively manage our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford. Quarter-after-quarter, we are delivering industry-leading financial performance with a sustainable core earnings ROE anchored at 15% while creating value for all our stakeholders. Let me now turn the call back over to Susan for Q&A.\n\nSusan Spivak - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

Your line is up.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Equity Research Analyst (TD Cowen):\nHey good morning. So, I\u2019m looking at the Commercial Lines expense ratio and with Hartford Next, you had significant improvement from 2021 to 2022. And then in the fourth quarter, you had 110 basis points of improvement. Now that Hartford Next is over, do you see that improvement continuing? And maybe to what degree?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nAndrew, I\u2019ll start and then Beth can add her commentary. So yes, I appreciate you pointing out the numbers. I think also, too, on a year-to-date basis, 2022 to 2023, the 60 basis point improvement, which, on a full year basis, I think, is a good run rate. And all I would say is, philosophically, we do have a continuous improvement mindset in the organization to get after additional expense efficiencies. I wouldn\u2019t say we have a formal program that we called out. But clearly, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s goals to become more efficient, create that operating leverage that as we grow the franchise, we just \u2013 it\u2019s a good levered model that more earnings drops to the bottom line. But Beth, what would you add?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nThanks, Chris. I think you covered on the pieces very well. If we look at the full year expense ratio for Commercial Lines ending at 31%, I think that\u2019s a really great result. And as Chris said, we are going to continue to look for efficiencies. But we\u2019re also very mindful of making sure that we\u2019re putting in place the appropriate investments that allow us to continue to deliver the outstanding results that you see in our Commercial Lines franchise.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Equity Research Analyst (TD Cowen):\nAnd then shifting over to personal auto. You got a 21.9% rate increase. I want to make sure I understand that. That\u2019s \u2013 is that pure rate? Or is that exposure growth? And then secondly, Chris, if I understood you, did you say that you expected five to seven points of loss ratio improvement? Or could it be a lot more than that given the 21.9% rate increase?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Andrew, on your first point, and Stephanie can add in her commentary, the 21.9%, I think we achieved is vast, vast majority, all pure rate. There might be a little exposure in there but very, very little. And I did say five to six points of improvement in auto next year. So \u2013 no, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay with numbers, so I\u2019ll help you out, five to six. So, we ended the year at 110. We think we can get down to 104 next year on an underlying basis. And that\u2019s why, again, we\u2019re going to have to continue to execute and work hard in 2025 to get down then to targeted margins, which I would say, on an underlying basis on auto is generally in the 95% to 96% range. You put two points for catastrophes on there, and that\u2019s your overall combined ratio. So yes, that\u2019s our plan. As I said before, I think Stephanie and the team have a very executable plan. They\u2019re executing well in the marketplace today and balancing, balancing new business, balancing renewals and balancing our spend in marketing. Stephanie, would you add any additional color?\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Personal Lines and Small Commercial (The Hartford):"

I guess, I\u2019d like to go back to your comment in the outlook portion of your presentation, where you said the ROE is anchored at 15%. It sounds to me like there\u2019s been a step-up in your expectations on the ROE range. And I\u2019m not trying to put words in your mouth, but I\u2019m just trying to understand exactly what you meant by anchored at 15%.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you for the question. I\u2019m happy to provide any clarity. I thought anchored was actually a pretty good word, because it really means sort of floor, in my mind. And Greg, we had a 14% to 15% ROE range as guidance last year. We\u2019re giving qualitative guidance this year as opposed to sort of the table. So, we really wanted to send a strong message that we\u2019re shifting and it\u2019s shifting higher. And the construct we came up with was let\u2019s just anchor 15% as far as the floor for everyone\u2019s expectations. We always, when we put out guidance, have a high probability of meeting that. And we play for upside. And you saw the way we ended 2023. And I\u2019d say I think we\u2019re off to a good start this year, and I think there will be upside in that floor number that we provide. But that was the mindset behind that.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):\nExcellent. That was my interpretation. Just wanted to make sure I had it right. So appreciate that. I want to pivot to the benefits side. I think \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry, I was writing down a bunch of numbers during the presentation. But I think you said the core earnings margin target for 2024 is going to be in the 6% to 7% range. It feels like there\u2019s been a step-up in the last couple of quarters in your core earnings margin. And then if I look at in Group Benefits for the full year, I think the core earnings margin for 2023 was 8.1% versus 6.5% in 2022. So is there something going on inside that business that\u2019s causing a step-down lower? Or maybe you can provide some color around the \u2013 your comments there?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Happy to, Greg. And I\u2019ll ask Jonathan Bennett who\u2019s with us to add his color. No, I think it\u2019s a great business. We\u2019ve always \u2013 I think it fits within The Hartford. It contributes mildly and it\u2019s improved, particularly coming out of COVID. So, I would just say that the 6% to 7%, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent. That\u2019s our long-term view. We\u2019re commenting on a long-term view for that business and particularly given some of the rate guarantees that are in that book of business. So \u2013 but I would also say that we had an excellent record year this year and that momentum, I think, will continue into 2024. And we like how it\u2019s positioned. We like our strategic initiatives. We like how we\u2019re investing for the future in this business. So yes, it\u2019s going to be and will remain a significant contributor going forward. Jonathan, what would you add?\n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nThat's a great setup, Chris. And Greg, I would add to that, that we look at the trends in a range when we start to plan our future and think about the 2024. And in calendar year 2023, a lot of those trends turned in the right direction in our ranges, but certainly in the right direction within our ranges. We talked about life coming out of the pandemic that has pulled back into a pretty good spot. We have some continued pricing action that we will execute on in 2024 and a bit beyond. But when you think about where we are in LTD, incidence levels coming into the calendar year, terrific. Also, our claim team did a wonderful job around recoveries. These have been things going on for us in our disability book, our LTD book for a number of years. And we feel like we're in a really good place, and the market has also seen some improvement there, too. But when we think about when we're headed in 2024, we put a range around that. We're just reminding that there is a range around it. And we would expect these lines of business to continue to contribute and contribute very, very well, supplemental health included, which has also been a big part of our margin story here in the calendar year 2023.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGreg, one last point. Remember, that 6% to 7% we've commented upon before turns into a 14% to 15% tangible ROE. So again, it's another rising \u2013 reason why we like this business so much. Margins are generally steady predictable and our ROEs are very contributory to us, particularly on a tangible basis.\n\nGregory Peters - Equity Research Analyst (Raymond James):"

On the Commercial Lines guidance to kind of keep underlying margins consistent for 2024 versus 2023, that obviously would be a \u2013 margins are at a great absolute level and that would be a good outcome. But just kind of curious what your thoughts are? Any details on kind of social inflationary lines, a lot of your peers have been kind of embedding a slightly higher loss costs trend on the go-forward, getting some IBNR. Just curious kind of within that outlook, any context around kind of the puts and takes other than workers' comp, which you talked about during the prepared remarks?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Mike thanks for the question. Yes, those are a reality of our society today, right? Social inflation, legal system abuse, however you want to call it. So it's alive and well. It's nothing new for many, many industry participants, but it is still something you have to be aware of, particularly in the umbrella in the excess liability lines. I'll ask Mo to add his commentary. But I think we've been thoughtful about the trends over the last couple of years and the need to stay on top of those trends with rate. And that's why I say particularly, we're looking for an element of consistency with 2023. Because in a lot of those long-tail liability casualty lines we need high-single to low-double digit rate increases to stay on top of the trend assumptions that we have. So yes, it's all part of managing multiple product line approach. But again, in aggregate, I think the setup is very similar to last year's setup at the time when we talked about it is that there's going to be some slight pressure on comp. And we're going to try to maintain and expand margins where possible in other lines of business. But Mo, what would you say specifically in the casualty world?\n\nMo Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nYes. Mike, we're watching these trends closely, and we think the performance has been good. But that being said we continue to work hard on rate. Chris referenced wholesale casualty accelerated throughout the year. So we're trying to make sure we're keeping rate on top of or at least not ahead \u2013 if we can, ahead of trend. The same thing happened in our Middle Market GL book, rate accelerated throughout the course of the year. So we're working hard on rate. At the same time, we've talked to you about it a couple of times now. We're making sure that the underlying exposure we continue to adjust. So for the past three, four years we've been working hard in the jurisdictions we're in, our customers are in. We're working hard on the limits we're deploying. So there's some long-term strategies playing out here that give us some confidence in our ability to navigate, which is a difficult environment.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful. And my follow-up is just on capital management. I see the guidance there. Just curious, top line growth has been fairly robust, which is obviously a good thing. If the top line growth kind of continues at similar-ish levels in 2024, which I assume as a capital user, I mean, should we be toggling maybe down the buyback levels a bit or am I splitting hairs here?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I'll let Beth add her color, but I think you're splitting hairs. So our opcos are well capitalized. You see what we have left in authorization through the end of 2024. Our intention is to complete that on a timely basis. But Beth, I don't want to take any more of your thunder.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. No, I think you said it well, Chris. I mean we \u2013 I talked about our expectations for dividends from the operating companies in 2024, which is up slightly from 2023. In the past, I've talked about that we typically target about 70% to 80% of the earnings to dividend out of the subs, and that provides us with enough room to fund the growth that we're expecting, so really no change in how we're managing the balance sheet and balancing those items.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

What do you think about exposure kind of the growth there as we look going forward? Is \u2013 what are you kind of seeing in that business? Do you think it's going to start to slow here in 2024 and could have an effect on top line?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nBrian, I know what you're trying to triangulate to. So all I'd say qualitatively on any top line point because we're not going to give a precise number in aggregate or by line of business is, I think the macro sets up well. I think the economy is performing well. You saw the jobs report this morning, and unemployment remains low. You could see the Fed as being a little cautious on how quickly it cuts rates, which actually we support. So I think the macro sets up well. All I would tell you is that what we saw in January, early indications are much of the same coming out of 2023 and sort of that double-digit range in commercial. So one-month does not make a trend. But I think the environment will be fairly conducive to continuing going forward. So we perform very well when the economy is performing well, and I think that's the general view I have heading into 2024.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. That's helpful. And then just another one here. There was another company that announced some reserving actions and specifically related to the construction liability business. I know Navigators used to write that. Maybe you can talk a little bit about your exposure to that business. Is that an area of concern? Just put maybe a little color around that?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. There's always things to be concerned about and worry about. That's not one of the top ones and principally because bluntly we've been there done that. Part of our integration and activities with the acquisition we did years ago was to deal with sort of with those balance sheet reserving issues that we knew were there and saw. So I think we've tackled that appropriately. I think we've made the adjustments in those older years, adjusted our loss picks and trends going forward. So I feel very comfortable and confident we got our arms around that issue a couple of years back. Would you add anything, Mo?\n\nMo Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nNo. Brian, I'd just say there is an underwriting element here that, so when we made the changes and when we had the Navigators book come in, we shifted some of the underwriting in response to some of these trends. And that would have been two, three, four years ago. So we feel good about the go-forward book as well.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):"

So Beth, you said $350 million buyback in the Q1, which is in line with the Q4 level. But you did point out, right, like the dividends out of group are going to be a few hundred million dollars higher in 2024 relative to 2023. So I think that that would give you a tailwind to perhaps have a higher level of buybacks in 2024. Is it just timing of dividends? And should we think about buybacks picking up in the back three quarters?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nWell, Elyse, I'll start with. I mean, we're executing on the share repurchase authorization that we have in place. And that is what we're executing to and as I said, we expect $350 million in the first quarter, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we think about dividends in total for 2024 operating company dividends versus 2023, they're up about $100 million in total. So that all obviously goes into how we think about the balance sheet strength going forward, but not making any changes on our current share repurchase plans.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. Thanks. And then my second question is on the Commercial Lines guidance. So I think you said underlying margins would be consistent but did point to a headwind in workers' comp. As Chris, I know you said pricing there would be flat-to-negative and we've gone through The Hartford Next program. So how do you think about the split between the loss and the expense ratio within commercial when you're coming to like an overall stable underlying margin in 2024?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Again, Elyse, what I tried to describe is that the setup is similar, right? So if there's pressure in comp, it needs to be offset by other components, non-comp in our product lines. You've seen what we've done with accelerating pricing, particularly in the fourth quarter. That mindset continues into 2024. So when I say hold or expand, that's what I mean. And look, I can't predict with great precision the top line, but I think there'll be some slight expense leverage. That will also contribute overall. So that's what I would say.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

You have the NICO cover for the asbestos in 2017. You have the Navigators cover from a few years ago. Both are having or about to be exhausted. As a sort of operating principle, when you buy an adverse development cover, do you buy with the expectation that it's likely it's going to be exhausted? Is that how it's structured? Or do you \u2013 is it kind of a surprise that you get to the end of the cover?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nSo ADC utilization, all I would say is it really depends, obviously, right I mean on the obviously on the navigators acquisition. It was part of the purchase price and funding there and dealing with it. So that's different. The A&E deal that we did with NICO was just slightly different as far as long term. So if we would do anything again in the future, it would have to be economic for us first off, and a lot of those deals that we did prior were just in a lower interest rate environment, just a different part of our development as an organization. And our performance, so the guiding principle that Beth and I talk about all the time is just what makes sense from an economic side, because they're not cheap and they're actually expensive. So you give up things to do it, to have that economic cover. So I would just say, Josh, it depends, and we're going to always try to think in terms of what is the best economics for the shareholders and pursue then the right strategy from there.\n\nJosh Shanker - Equity Research Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd back when you did the 2017 Governor, you were in a different capital position than you are today. I assume so. Even if there was a deal available to you today, perhaps it doesn\u2019t the urgency is different than it was seven, eight years ago.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, I think you got it right. Totally. Six, seven, eight years ago, we were just in a different place. And I just think we're in a better place. We have prudence on the balance sheet. That feels good. And so, yes you're right. Totally different place.\n\nJosh Shanker - Equity Research Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd the other question, also a philosophical one. I was talking to Aileen [ph] last night, and I think that these are the best commercial results you guys have had almost ever looked at. Going back to 2006, there was one quarter that might be better, and clearly it's the best group benefits results ever. What do you say to concerns that these might be peak margins?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nWell, we never give up. We keep on pushing ourselves to reset the bar higher, perform better. We have a growth orientation now that I think we've earned the right to think differently and creatively about the marketplace and activities we could pursue that are profitable and accretive to our shareholders.

It sounds like you guys had really good growth last year in line with what you guys are saying. How are you thinking about growth growing the property line in 2024 and if there's any sort of mix shift benefit that we should think about coming through incrementally to margins next year?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nDavid, I would say, yes we're pleased with what we accomplished this year, but it's not the end of the mission or it's really just sort of the beginning. So growing that book about 20% to $2.5 billion, I'm looking at my pricing sheet, with overall pricing up on the full portfolio, about 16%. Our non-CAT property weather was essentially on plan for the year between our various business units. So feel really good about the underwriting, the tools. Obviously, our reinsurance programs that Beth talked about, we made adjustments to. So we have all the components. Obviously, it's still a constructive marketplace to really build that national diversified book of business that we want to have. So just because you asked, and I like you, I'm going to tell you that I think we could produce about $3 billion of premium next year.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nAwesome. That's great. Thanks for that Chris. And then maybe just following up, good growth last year in Commercial Lines, up 10%. I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk about how much exposure maybe contributed to that in 2023.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nWell, the exposure piece I can give you right now that I have in my mind is related to pricing, right? So if you look at our pricing expanding to 8.5% this quarter, about 2.5 points of it is exposure-related. So if you go back and look at \u2013 it's been generally consistent, sort of, I would say, one-third, two-third. So that's what I have there. But I'll look to Mo and Stephanie to see if they want to add any color on exposure and Personal Lines or Middle Market.\n\nStephanie Bush - Head of Personal Lines and Small Commercial (The Hartford):\nI'll start. It's Stephanie, David. From a Small Commercial perspective, I just want to continue on some of the comments that Chris and Beth made in the prepared remarks, but Small Commercial will continue to be a growth in earnings engine. You talked about exposure, but we look at many factors in small. We look at new business starts. Those remain healthy. Unemployment in our sector is healthy. We track small business owner sentiment and the likelihood of them to invest and hire, and that is at a high level. And again, audit premiums, again, still strong. So you take all that in combination with the results that we had, $913 million, all in just in new written premium. We grew every line. We grew policies in force in every line. And then as the team referenced that we delivered outstanding underlying in the fourth quarter and then our 14th consecutive quarter of 90 or below. So the business model is incredibly strong and powered by exceptional data analytics and an outstanding team. So Chris touched on it. We had an outstanding start to the year, but it's a long way to go. But I feel really confident in what we'll be able to continue to deliver. So I look at it broader than just exposure. It's all of those combinations. And then again, from a personal insurance perspective, I think Chris and Beth laid out our mission very well in the auto line as well as in the home line. Home results are very strong as well, and that contributes to our growth and our aspiration to be a stronger property market. So I'll turn it over to Mo.\n\nMo Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford):\nYes. Many of the same messages. I think the exposure growth we are seeing, and again, across comp, property is holding in well and even into January is holding well. So I think we just \u2013 we and think the economy is very supportive there. So David, I don't have much more to add to Stephanie's summary there.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

So is there any excess capital drawdown there to consider, those kind of things?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I'll take that, Alex. No, I mean, again, we're looking at it on a statutory basis. And obviously, dividends out of Group Benefits have been lower over the last couple of years given those results.

Please go ahead. \n\nSusan Bernstein - Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on first quarter 2024 earnings.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris. \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a strong start to the year, sustaining outstanding financial results through the first quarter. Our strategy and ongoing investments, combined with disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, and innovative customer-centric technology, continue to drive outperformance.  Let me call your attention to some highlights we achieved in the quarter. Top line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% and with an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, strong renewal written pricing increases in Commercial and Personal Lines, Group Benefits core earnings margin of 6.1% and solid performance in our investment portfolio, all these contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6% reflecting consistency of our margins and a continued growth generated by our businesses.  Now let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines performance reflects strong top line growth at highly profitable margins. In the marketplace, we are prudently taking advantage of elevated submission flow, in part driven by the investments we have made to expand our product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience.  From that flow, we are using our data science advancements, pricing expertise in industry-leading underwriting tools to drive profitable double-digit new business growth in each of our three businesses. In addition, retention is steady and exposure growth remains solid although moderating from the elevated levels seen in the past couple of years.    In Small Commercial, we are shattering previous quarterly written premium records while sustaining underlying margins. New business growth was 11% in the quarter, driven by strong submission flow and growth in E&S binding. We are particularly pleased with E&S binding, a key area of focus, which is on track to grow annual written premiums by approximately 50% in 2024 to nearly $300 million.    I remain incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial and bullish on its outlook. We expect to sustain outstanding financial results by reliably serving agents and customers with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy.    Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. The financial performance continues to be exceptional. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and new business growth of 18% with an especially good quarter in guaranteed cost construction and general industries. We are building a track record of delivering meaningful growth while consistently maintaining underlying margins.  The stellar performance in this business is a direct result of our underwriting discipline, enabled by the investments we have made to enhance our capabilities. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we remain well positioned to profitably grow this business.  In Global Specialty, results were excellent with underlying margins consistent with last year and solid top line growth reflecting our competitive position, breadth of products and strong renewal written pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 20% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines.  We are particularly pleased with wholesale construction activity found in the quarter as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. We remain excited about the Global Specialty business, including our position in wholesale and reinsurance market and from a broadened product portfolio.  Looking across Commercial Lines, we continue to grow our property book, another key area of focus. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including no change in our catastrophe risk appetite.  Property written premium for the quarter was approximately 17% higher than in 2023.   Turning to pricing. Excluding workers' compensation, Commercial Lines renewal written pricing rose [ 0.7% ] from the fourth quarter to 9% with strong low double-digit pricing in property and auto and high single digit in general liability.  Public D&O pricing is still pressured, though relatively stable with the fourth quarter. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained comfortably above loss cost trends.  In workers' compensation, renewal written pricing remained slightly positive in the quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines delivered an outstanding first quarter results with ongoing momentum in the market.  Moving to Personal Lines. Our first quarter financial performance demonstrate the progress towards restoring targeted profitability in auto, as we continue to address current loss trends. Auto renewal written price increases of nearly 26% have likely peaked given our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year.  In addition, we have achieved new business rate adequacy in the vast majority of states and as a result have resumed national advertising this month. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends.  This year, we are celebrating our 40th anniversary with AARP. In 1984, we embarked on this journey with a shared vision and commitment to serve mature market customers. Our focus on this preferred segment, coupled with our modern innovative and digitally enhanced product and platform prevail is a competitive advantage.  Our updated offering is currently available in 42 states and represents approximately 60% of our new business premium this quarter. With"

Our updated offering is currently available in 42 states and represents approximately 60% of our new business premium this quarter. With pricing gains, enhanced risk segmentation, and moderating loss trends, I expect Personal Lines to meaningfully contribute to core earnings as it returns to profitability in 2024 and reaches target margins in 2025.  Turning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin of 6.1% for the quarter included improved mortality trends from the prior year and continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% reflects strong but slightly lower persistency and a 6% decline in sales primarily driven by group life, where we are being disciplined with pricing and underwriting in this competitive marketplace.  We continue to strengthen our capabilities for customer service, with an extensive suite of tools for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification and analytics. As part of our strategy to grow amongst small and midsized businesses, we are investing in our platform. This includes strengthening distribution relationships and actively seeking out new partnerships. Employers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees and our products and services are a key part of that value proposition.  Moving to investments. The portfolio continues to support The Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions, and Beth will provide more details.    In summary, The Hartford delivered another strong quarter with sustained momentum heading into the remainder of the year.  Let me reiterate why I am so bullish about the future. First, our financial results continue to prove the effectiveness of our strategy and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. Second, Personal Lines results are showing improvement. We are achieving necessary rate increases, and expect 2024 margins to progress towards targeted profitability. Third, with our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, an innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to sustain superior results. Fourth, investment income remained solid, supported by elevated yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets.   And finally, we remain dedicated to enhancing shareholder value through supporting organic growth, continued investment in our business and proactively managing our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford, and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance.    Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. \n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $709 million or $2.34 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6%. Commercial Lines had an outstanding quarter with core earnings of $546 million and an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, in line with our expectations and slightly better than the prior year first quarter.  Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8%, and an underlying combined ratio of 89.6, further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90.  Middle & Large Commercial also delivered outstanding results with 9% growth over the prior year and this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of written premium exceeding $1 billion. The underlying combined ratio was excellent at 89.2, a 0.7 point improvement over first quarter 2023, primarily due to a lower expense ratio driven by the impact of strong earned premium growth.  Global Specialty's underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.3, relatively flat to the prior year. Written premium growth of 8% was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and new business growth of 17%, excluding Global Re.    In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $33 million with an underlying combined ratio of 96.1, including a strong homeowners underlying combined ratio of 77. The auto underlying combined ratio of 104.4 was in line with our expectations and is a year-over-year improvement of 3.7 points. Once the reported ratio for the first quarter of 2023 is increased for the 3 points of development that occurred in the second quarter of 2023.  This result is consistent with achieving the 5- to 6-point full year improvement we previously discussed. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 13% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 25.7% and earned pricing increases of 19.1%.  In homeowners, written pricing increases were 15.2% for the quarter and 14.4% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 1.2 points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing costs as we increase our marketing spend to drive new business growth in those states where rates are adequate.  With respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year cats were $161 million before tax or 4.2 combined ratio points which compares to $185 million in 2023 or 5.3 points on the combined ratio. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $32 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and ocean marine.  In addition, we had $7 million of favorable development in personal auto physical damage. We also recorded $24 million before tax in deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC. This positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million before tax with the remaining balance amortized in 2025.  We have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference.  Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $107 million and a 6.1% core earnings margin reflect improved life results, continued strong disability performance and fully insured premium growth. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter.  The group disability loss ratio of 70.1 improved 0.3 points from 2023, driven by continued strong claim recoveries, partially offset by higher incidents in paid family leave and short-term disability products. The group life loss ratio of 82.6 improved 4.1 points versus prior year, reflecting improved mortality.  Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was driven by exposure growth, which remained positive, albeit at a lower rate than in the prior year. Book persistency in the first quarter of 2024 was strong at over 90%, but approximately 1.5 points below record high levels in 2023.  Turning to investments. Our diversified investment portfolio continues to produce solid results. For the quarter, net investment income was $593 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.3% before tax, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023.  Our annualized LP returns were 1.3% and included positive returns from our private equity portfolio. Our real estate equity portfolio returns were impacted by lower valuations and the absence of real estate JV equity sales.  Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, limited partnership returns in the second quarter are likely to be similar to first quarter results, with private equity returns being offset by declines in real estate valuations and property "

We continue to believe our real estate holdings are durable, and we will be patient as it relates to any sales in order to maximize value. Although we anticipate LP returns for the full year could be below 2023 results, we continue to believe that over the long term, results will continue to add value and be consistent with historical returns.  The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Net credit losses remain insignificant.   Turning to capital. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024.  To wrap up, our first quarter results reflect another quarter of delivering on our targeted returns to enhance value for all of our stakeholders.    I will now turn the call back to Susan. \n\nSusan Bernstein - Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you. We will now take your questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

      "raw_bytes": "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. \n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nChris, I noticed in your opening remarks, you talked about some pressure on group life sales. Is that something that you foresee going forward? I mean overall sales were -- I think revenues were up about 2% in the quarter. So do you see that line being a bit pressured and maybe you could give us a little color on what's happening in the group life area? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nHappy to, Andrew. Welcome. Yes, we did call out a little lighter sales volume during the quarter. I'm looking at Jonathan Bennett, he could give you additional color also.   But I think, Andrew, you might recall, we've talked about being fairly disciplined in our thinking about where mortality is trending, particularly coming out after the pandemic. And the trends are downward, but we probably -- we believe we're still operating in an endemic state of mortality, which means it's going to be higher than normal, which we think will continue for at least the next couple of years. And we've been pricing our product with that view, which obviously has an impact then on sales if market participants don't have a similar view.  So I think it's all good, it's all healthy. For us, again, key message I want you to know we're being discipline, but it might come at a cost of slightly lower group life sales than we maybe have enjoyed in the past.  But Jonathan, what would you add? \n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Chris, I agree with everything you've said. And I think, Andrew, just reinforced the importance of us having our point of view and executing on that in the marketplace. If you think about where we are in the group life cycle, we're looking to the future, we're seeing improvements. When you look back at your trends, which is where you start and thinking about your pricing philosophy, a lot of that data is loaded with excess mortality and COVID losses.   So the first step you have to do is figure out what to extract, how to normalize, if you will, for that data. And it might sound obvious to say, well, just take all the COVID claims out, but that's not how they always get reported. And so as a result, there is a fair amount of variation in judgment applied as you do that.  And then looking forward, you need to make a call on where you feel like mortality will be in the next 3 to 5 years. And as we sit here today, if you were to pull some CDC data, I think you would see that the reported deaths are still trending -- are still a bit higher than they were prior to the pandemic.  So when we weave all that in, we have our conviction about where we think things are going. But I would say the range right now in the marketplace in pricing is about as wide as it's been ever based on all of those ambiguities and how pricing can be developed.  And that really is, I think, what's the cause for some uncertainty in the marketplaces. But as Chris said, we have a strong point of view on where we are. We're confident and comfortable with that and we'll continue to compete. Our capabilities are actually as strong as ever in that marketplace, and we feel quite good about our positioning. \n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nThat's very helpful. And then my follow-up is, there's been a ton of talk now about long-tail reserving. I mean, for a while, it's been 16 to 19 underwriting years. Now people are talking about 20 to 22 or 23. And when we looked at your reserves this quarter, I mean, it looked pretty modest in general liability and assumed re, and marine, and those were 16 to 19 years per your releases.  Any concerns? I mean, you looked great, but some of your competitors didn't. And so anything to read into going forward? Any concerns on your part? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Andrew, I'll start and I'll let Mo and Beth add their commentary. But yes, I'm not going to speak to competitors because everyone is just slightly different, but the confidence that we have particularly in our current loss picks are very, very high. And I think the context that I think Mo and Beth will explain to you is that we've been hard at work in sort of improving our underwriting our book, reunderwriting it, looking at different classes of business, changing terms and conditions, and Mo will give you more color. Beth can talk about the actuarial analysis that we do on a quarterly basis, which is very robust and gives us a high degree of confidence in our picks, particularly for the most recent years.  But we're also humble enough to admit we didn't get everything right over the last 5 years. And when we feel that adjustments are made, we're pretty clear and transparent about why we're making those adjustments, and that will continue going forward. But Andrew, as we sit here today, I think you got it right, we feel good, we're not immune, but on a relative basis, I think we'll be better than most.  But Mo, Beth, what would you add? \n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nSo I'll start, and then I'll let Mo provide some color and just add on to what Chris indicated. But as you noted, Andrew, in the general liability reserves, the prior year development that we recorded this quarter was related to the 2016 to 2019 years since some large loss activity. And as Chris said, we do evaluate these reserves quarter-to-quarter and when we see activity, we do react to it.  As it relates to the more current years, those tend to trend very well. As you know, these are long-tail liabilities. So even if in the short term, they're looking strong. We don't react to that because, as I said, these are long tailed in nature. But overall, we've not seen things in the more recent years that would cause us to change our picks at this point.    And when I look at a variety of measures, and I know you do as well, IBNR levels, paid activity, I think our more recent accident years stand out as being strong. But it's also really important to understand, as Chris was indicating, actions that we've taken over this period to improve the overall book, which even adds to how we feel about our overall reserves in the more current years.  But maybe, Mo, I'll turn it to you to talk about some of the things that you and your team have been doing over the last several years in this area. \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Andrew, maybe three themes just to build on Beth's point about actions we've taken over that time period. So first is, obviously, we've put significant rate in each of those years since 2019 in each of the three books, and that is well in excess of some healthy trend.    Second theme I would put out there is just remember the SME nature of our book, I mean, we just have a lower underlying, for example, auto exposure. Just to give you 1 stat, 79% of our middle-market umbrella book attaches for clients with less than 10 vehicles. So it gives you a sense of the size of fleets, which is where a lot of the pressure is coming from is just auto. We don't have a transportation book of any real note. We don't really -- we've never deployed limits of greater than $25 million gross, and we have important reinsurance involved there.   And then the third, Andrew, I just -- I think we've taken significant underwriting actions as both Chris and Beth referred to, since 2019, and that's industry related, it's related to litigation hotspots. We've managed limits. Just as one example in our global specialty book, we got out of all primary GL high-hazard in 2017. We just didn't think we could make money. And we haven't gone"

We're pretty pleased with the start on Personal Lines in totality. You saw the metrics that we've talked about, 25.7% written rate increase for auto, 15-ish in home, and I think the team is executing very, very well.  I would give you a couple of data points to have you consider. As we think about the full year in '24, we still see auto getting about 20 points of rate, plus or minus. So we still have that conviction, which then lays the foundation for the targeted profitability in 2025 that we've been talking about. I would say we're beginning to see moderation both in our auto loss cost trends on a BI and a PD basis, not going to give you precise numbers just because it could be bouncy any 1 quarter to 1 quarter.  But overall trends for '23, let's say, we're in the mid-single digits. And I expect -- excuse me, mid-double digits. And I expect that to come down into the low double-digit range here in '24. Maybe there could be more improvement from there, but that's our best call at this point in time.  And I think Beth importantly reiterated our point of view that we do see 5 to 6 points of underlying auto loss ratio improvement in 2024. And I think that, again, will put us on the right track to hitting targeted profitability in '25. So yes, we are rate adequate in 80% of our states. There's a couple of states that are going to be laggards for a while. They'll go nameless. But we feel good about what we're doing with auto.  And then likewise, with home, you saw the underlying combined ratios improved over years. I thought our cat performance in total for the quarter, although slightly elevated to expectations, was still in line or within a range of long-term trends. So pleased with the team and what they're doing both in auto and home in Personal Lines.  Beth, would you add anything? \n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Just a couple of things. Also, I'd point out that we did see some favorable development on the '23 accident year primarily coming out of the fourth quarter for auto physical damage. So we see that as an important proof point, too. I just want to clarify on Chris' comment on the book loss trend, mid-teens.  So that is mid double-digit, but just to be clear, mid-teens, and we do expect that to decline over the period. But as Chris said, we're being cautious and looking at it very carefully and feel very good to be on track to get to the improvement that we laid out at the beginning of the year. \n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my follow-up is on Commercial Lines. Looking at the price disclosure, stable on a reported basis, right, but that obviously reflects the comp concentration. How do you guys see just pricing across Commercial Lines playing out as we move through this year? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I'll add my color, and then Mo will add his. But I hope you felt it in our tone, Elyse, we're really pleased. The team is working hard from an execution side, to have ex-comp. Our written renewal rate increased, increased to 70 basis points, I thought it was healthy. That does include an element of exposure to that excess rate, which we call out in the general 2.3 points range or 25% exposure, 75% rate base.    So I think we see a lot of stability in the marketplace and still very optimistic as we play out 2024 here. So I think that, again, why we talked about early on of the year of the stability of our margins and generally having a consistent outcome compared to 2023, I think it's still alive and well in our thesis as we execute here through midyear.  But Mo, what would you add? \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Elyse, I would say it's competitive but generally supportive because we talked about properties moderating a little bit outside of our BOP, and the BOP is still accelerating just in terms of what we're able to get there in terms of rate. The excess in umbrella is accelerating again, and auto is accelerating again. So broadly, I just -- I think we feel like the market is being fairly disciplined, fairly disciplined, and supportive of what we're trying to get done for the year."

So Chris, in your prepared comments, you talked about the no change in sort of the catastrophe profile of your property business. And yet you said that you're growing your property business, I think you -- the number you cited was 17% higher in the quarter. Maybe you can help reconcile how you grow your property business and not change your cat profile? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nWell, cat profile versus risk appetite, I'd see a little difference. I mean, we're not increasing our property cat appetite per se. We've always said that we're willing to write property if it comes with some incremental small elements of cat, in which I think we've been managing perfectly and Mo could give you more colors.\n\n But I would say -- and let me just give you a couple of stats is that pricing in our property book, ex our Global Re business is about 14% up compared to 14.4% in the fourth quarter. As I said, we're growing at 17% and we're growing it in an important line:\nspectrum, E&S binding, our general industries properties.  Our large property capabilities are up almost 35%. And again, the pricing, I think, is still firmed and holding up pretty well.   But Mo, what would you add? \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Greg, I would just say that there are a couple of cat metrics that the team were really focused on. And for example, a, also annual aggregate loss to premium ratios trying to keep those flat. So as premium goes up, obviously, we would like the AAL to stay relatively flat.   And the same thing as we think about tail, we don't want to put on the risk without thinking about the tail risk. So we are closely looking at tail multiples like, for example, 100-year PMLs over premium. So those are the types of ratios that we're watching. So yes, the exposure itself is growing certainly from a cat perspective, but we're trying to keep it in balance as to the same rate as premium growth. \n\nCharles Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. That makes sense. So then building on some of your previous answers, I'm looking at the stats on new business production policy counts inside your commercial business and things look like they're going really well.  I do remember a couple of quarters ago, you calling out some price competition in the middle market area. Just trying to get an update on, it seems pretty stable and the outlook seems pretty bullish. But when you look forward, what are the areas that you're concerned about for potential competitive challenges? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. It's a competitive market. And I would say, especially in the larger end of each of our segments, so the larger end of small, we are finding more competitive, the larger end of middle is more competitive, and the larger end of the specialty business. So anything with a lot of premium on the slip typically has a little more competition to it.  But the only area that we're dramatically pulling back on is, as we've talked about many times, is public D&O. We just haven't seen that market stabilize the way we would like to. So you will see that book continue to shrink. Outside of that, Greg, I think we feel pretty good about the rest of the portfolio."

Year-over-year, the policy count is down is around about 5%, which -- that might be a good outcome given how much rate you're pushing through. One of your probably the largest direct competitor in the market, they raised prices not as much as you over the last couple of years have lost 20% of their business.  What is the experience of retaining clients given that you are a direct carrier and you only can present them with Hartford product? Are they wanting to change and you're committing them to stay? Are they doing buy-downs? How is that experience coming with the retention? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nJosh, thank you for joining us. Yes, that's the trade-off we're making right now, lower retention for a more profitable cohort to get us back to that targeted profitability. So I don't think it's outside of the range of expectations that we've had as far as that trade-off.  I think we've talked about sort of the PIF count decline compared to 2023 before. We still see that in that 4% range. So again, that speaks to our conviction to get the necessary rate in the book. And you're right, I mean it's a direct response business. I mean, it's Middle America from a customer side. So there's not a lot of, I'll call it, financial engineering we're doing vis-a-vis rate buydowns on auto or home, deductibles, things like that. It's pretty straightforward. We're sort of -- again, strictly in the admitted business.  But I think generally, people understand the need to keep up with trend, the inflationary pressures, the weather patterns are changing, all the social litigation and legal abuse systems that we've talked about is keeping pressure on our loss cost. And again, we've been able to work with our regulators to get rates approved either on a pre-approved basis or file and use. So I think we're executing well, and it's still a very dynamic and challenged environment. \n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nI don't mean to belabor the point, but I'm just curious if the customers are giving you a chance to retain them, are they calling up and asking what can we do to help me? Or are you just getting a notification that they've left to a competitor? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI think it's more of the latter. I don't think we're having very many negotiations over the phone as far as our product and our offer. And we're being empathetic when we talk to our customers, particularly the mature customers, but there's not a negotiation."

Just curious how loss trend assumptions if they're steady in the first quarter relative to, I guess, '23? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would say generally, our views on loss trends from '23 have increased modestly and that's obviously reflected in what we're trying to execute from a written rate side and the discipline we have there. And again, that the guidance that we try to give our underwriters with appropriate discretion, but yes, I would say loss trend is up modestly in '24 compared to '23."

But I would -- there's two E&S components I'd have you think about. One is in Small, right? Our E&S binding business, which we've called out and we'd like to try to get to that $300 million level. And then, obviously, all our E&S capabilities within Global Specialty, whether it be property or casualty, that is an important component of what we're trying to do in the marketplace.   But Mo, what would you add from an overall growth rate perspective? \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nBrian, I would say we're excited about the flow in both of the channels that Chris talks about, both in that binding, which is the Small Commercial and the flow into our brokerage that continues to grow nicely. We saw -- we continue to see the growth, as Chris called out in his prepared remarks on the binding side. And we're seeing really good growth in the brokerage side, which sits in our Global Specialty business in both primary casualty, excess casualty, that rate environment continues to accelerate, as I talked about earlier.   We're undersized in property brokerage and in Global Specialty, we're undersized in inland marine, we're undersized in auto. So we just see that, especially on the global specialty side, there's plenty of opportunity and the flow is there to support it. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. That's helpful. And then second question, Chris, bigger picture question here. Looking at your Personal Lines business and understanding that the last couple of years have been challenging from inflation stuff, but if I look at your homeowners business, it's been close to a decade since you've grown unit volume there. In auto it's probably 6, 7 years, maybe a blip here and there. I'm just curious, maybe what kind of was going on during that period? And is the Prevail product kind of the answer to that now, where maybe at some point here, we'll see [indiscernible] start to grow unit in the Personal Lines space? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nBrian, I appreciate the question. I'm going to spare the torture going back 7, 8 years for everyone on what didn't go right. But I think more importantly, and we've talked about it in the various settings that, the Prevail product and platform does give us a step-change in our abilities to effectively compete in our core market, which is a mature preferred segment through an AARP endorsement that will allow us to be more competitive in auto, in home, and as much as I said, we do continue to expect PIF count, particularly in auto to decline this year by 4%.   We've also talked about that we feel like we can start to grow PIF count modestly in '25, and then maybe more meaningfully in '26. So I think that's where we're at. We've made the investment. We're in 42 states. We should be in 46 by the end of the year and couple of other states will lag a little bit.  But I think it gives us every opportunity to be growth-orientated. And then we'll see where we could take the Prevail platform. Right now, it's obviously geared towards a direct response platform and channel, but maybe there's others that we would explore getting into at the right time.   Once we finish off the implementation of Prevail in the vast -- or all the states feasible, we'll start to think about the future a little bit differently. But we want to take care of the core right now. We want to get it back to overall profitability, particularly in auto, and then we'll build from there, Brian. \n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. And on the homeowners, the geographic constraints, just given where a lot of your customers maybe as far as growth? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo. I mean, we're obviously in all 50 states on minute basis. You know we paused our new homeowners in California, which is a writing new homeowners business until the regulatory reforms get enacted to allow us to match price and risk appropriately. So that's the only self-imposed constraint we had. There's no other constraint besides our long-standing not writing any new homeowners business in Florida since 15, 16 years -- almost 20 years ago, I bet."

Could you comment kind of if there's a trend there that's causing pricing to move north? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would say that the components that are driving that is primarily global. Global had a good quarter. I'm looking at through my sheets and all the casualty lines, property lines, international rebounded in a good way. So that's what I would call out.  But Mo, what would you add? \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo. I think we are continuing to see moderation in the negative rates on public D&O. We're certainly seeing a shift in our portfolio towards more of the management and professional liability. So there's a mix coming through there, that's a part of it. I don't want to get too nuanced on you, but just that's the only additional detail I would give to Chris' comments. \n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThe only other thing I would add to that is when you look at the Small Commercial side, ex comp, definitely saw rate increase there coming from the Spectrum product. So again, obviously, workers' comp is a large portion of Small Commercial. But if you ex that out, that contributed to the ex comp growth as well. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful color. And I guess lastly, just not trying to nitpick, but the -- you mentioned in the prepared -- or in your comments, Chris, that a larger end of, I think, Small, more competitive, yet you're successfully accelerating growth on the business in Small Commercial. So any kind of color you'd want to offer there on those dynamics? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nWell, the only thing I'll say before Mo jumps in is, our Small Commercial franchise is world-class. \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nHard to build on that, but I will try. I think the nuance we're trying to strike for you is that there are competitive spots in the marketplace, and we're just really proud of how well our underwriters are navigating what is increased flow, and that increased flow doesn't come as all business that we want to write, and that's the same in Small, Middle and Global. The flow is up significantly in all three businesses, and we're just trying to get underwriters to really pick our spots, and that's what we're trying to call out, Mike. Thanks. \n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nAnd I guess just is the Small -- you brought up E&S many times and there's different levels or different types of E&S, but it's been in your prepared remarks for a number of quarters. Is part of the E&S growth off of your Small Commercial chassis, which is kind of the world-class product? Or is it just -- is it totally separate type of underwrite platform? \n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines or Chief Underwriting Officer (exact title may vary, but senior executive in Commercial Lines) (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, that's the beauty of the model, Mike. We're taking all of the strengths that we've had in the retail channel and applying the same business model to the wholesale channel, and that's why we're so excited."

Jonathan, you can give you additional color.

In terms of the top line, '23, of course, was pretty exceptional on all the key metrics, the drive result. But I think we are seeing really strong results here even in the first quarter of 2024 comparatively speaking.   But from a persistency standpoint, we still have book persistency in the low 90s, which is historically quite good. We're very excited about that. It was even higher a year ago. And I think that does reflect a little bit the competitive nature of the market and the more likelihood that a customer may, in fact, take a case or take their business out to market. So we're addressing all of that. I think we're working through those renewal challenges and being quite successful with it and very much picking our spots. .  On the new sales, also a bit more competitive in that market. We're excited adding new lines of coverage to existing cases. That's always important. And I think one of the best opportunities we have to continued sales growth is rounding that out. There can be a little bit of a downside with that, of course, in some cases, around voluntary as an example. It's a smaller set of lines if the bigger lines like disability move, perhaps voluntary goes with it.  So those kinds of effects in the marketplace as we're working through and addressing them, but we continue to have really strong results on supplemental health. And we've had some very exciting growth. It's a little bit more tapered right now, but an area that we continue to expand in and see a lot of big opportunities that trend into the future in 2024 and beyond, I can already see, continues to accelerate. So a place that we will stay focused and continue to deliver results. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nAnd my second question, I want to make sure I heard, Chris, your comment correctly with regards to loss trends in personal auto. Did you say that they're currently in the low-teens or you expect them to be in the low-teens for '24? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI was trying to do, compared to '23 to '24. Mid-teens in '23, low double digits in '24, or for the full year whatever I was just trying to say is that it bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. So I'd rather have you see the bigger picture trend that going from mid-teens down to even high double-digits is a pretty meaningful move. \n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nAnd I guess the reason I'm asking this is it does seem to be a little bit higher than what we're seeing industry-wide right now? Is there something unique to the AARP book or to the policies that you're writing that, that would keep the loss trend a bit above maybe mid- to high single digits? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI would just say our judgment and prudence is leading us to call that number where we sit today. And if it changes during the year, we'll let you know."

I was hoping you could give us some guidance on how to think about how much lower the current Personal Lines expense ratio is compared to when you're in normal growth mode? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nSo I would say on the expense ratio, I would have you think of the full year '23 compared to the full year '24 about being the same.   Beth, I don't know if you would add any? \n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would agree with that. As we go through '24, you might see a slight uptick in Q2 because as we said, we are turning on marketing. And again, as the rate continues to earn into the book, that will start to level off. But our overall expectation right now for Personal Lines expense ratio, as Chris said, full year this year to full year last year will be relatively flat. \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Is it fair to think of it as being a little bit depressed just because of, I guess, the states where growth is, it doesn't make sense at? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI don't think I understood the question. It was just hard to hear you. \n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nI'm sorry. No, I was trying to get a sense as to whether we should expect, we look out to whenever personal auto is normalized, that the expense ratio should be a little bit higher than where it's been running for the past couple of years. \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNot necessarily, right? I mean there's a volume issue, dollars and then a rate. So again, with the amount of rate we're getting the book, I think it's helping keep the ratio the same. We might actually be increasing dollars, which we are sort of in a J-curve model this year. But from a ratio side, that's why I tried to give you that full year number to sort of manage your expectation."

When I think about Commercial Lines sort of full year this year for '24 compared to '23 expecting it to be relatively flat as we go through the year. Again, any 1 quarter, you can have some movements relative to bad debt reserve adjustments and things like that. But overall, we see it relatively consistent."

I'll take that. We actually have very detailed disclosures in our 10-Q and our IFS on that. So for workers' compensation, releases were about $67 million, and then we always have the workers discount accretion that comes in for 12 that goes offset against that.  And then general liability was 17, and marine was 7, and assumed reinsurance was 9. But you could go to Page 38 in our 10-Q, and it lays it all out for you. \n\nJian Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nYes, sorry for that. I must [indiscernible] so that's totally my fault. So maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you maybe talk about the current reserving environment for workers' comp in terms of as we now 3 years out from COVID, are there's still quite a bit of favorable uplift, so to speak, post-COVID or do you think the workers' comp book from a reserving perspective is likely to kind of normalize back down to more of a pre-2019 environment? \n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. It's a complicated question, but I would say I think it's normalized. Obviously, during COVID, there were a lot of assumptions made as far as where trends were that obviously turned out to be prudent, but sort of 2 years out from sort of the official end of workers' comp, I think trends are behaving as we would expect.  Frequency continues to be positive. Severity is still within our expectations, which we always talked about, Bob, being a 5% trend, which, again, severity is behaving within that expectation. So yes, as I think about '23 and '24, with a lot of continuity and consistency in workers' comp trends."

I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSusan Spivak - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on second quarter 2024 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all the earnings-related materials on our website. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford's second quarter results were outstanding, contributing to excellent financial performance in the first-half of the year. These results reflect the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing investments to differentiate The Hartford in the marketplace. We remain focused on disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, expanding product and distribution breadth, developing exceptional talent and delivering a superior customer experience. Highlights from the second quarter include top line growth in Commercial Lines of 11% with strong renewal written pricing increases, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Personal Lines' top line growth of 14%, with improving margins, an exceptional Group Benefits core earnings margin of 10%, and solid performance in our investment portfolio, all of these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. I'm also pleased to announce that with continued strong capital generation from our businesses, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billon. We will continue to balance growth, investing in our businesses, and returning excess capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Now, let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines produced exceptional results with double-digit top line growth in an underlying combined ratio below 90 for the 13th straight quarter. We are using our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements to drive profitable double-digit new business growth. Retention was steady, and the broader economic environment remains conducive for growth. In Small Commercial, with our unique and superior market position, industry-leading products, unmatched customer experience, and unrivaled pricing accuracy, we continue to deliver exceptional results, including strong top line growth and outstanding margins. New business premium was a record of 23% in the quarter, in part driven by a 36% increase in quotes, and nearly 90% growth in E&S binding, where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. With another quarter of exceptional results and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our Small Commercial business. Moving to Middle & Large Commercial, second quarter performance was excellent, including double-digit top line growth, paired with a strong underlying margin. We continue to take advantage of elevated submission flow, driven in part by investments made to expand our product capabilities, and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution, along with double-digit new business growth, primarily in property and liability coverages. We have built a track record of delivering meaningful growth, while consistently maintaining underlying margins, a result we expect to sustain going forward. In Global Specialty, for the first time, we achieved over a $1 billion in quarterly written premium and maintained underlying margins in the mid-80s. Our double-digit top line growth reflects our competitive position, diverse product offerings and solid renewal pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 38% increase in global reinsurance, a 14% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines and double-digit growth in commercial and construction surety. We are particularly pleased with wholesale construction projects bound in the quarter, as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. The Global Specialty business with our expanding position in the wholesale and reinsurance market, our broadened product portfolio and enhanced risk selection tools has developed into a meaningful profitable growth engine for The Hartford. As I've highlighted in the past, we continue to focus on property across Commercial Lines with written premium growth of approximately 20% in the quarter. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including a stable and consistent catastrophe risk appetite. Turning to pricing, Commercial Lines renewal written pricing accelerated to 6.6% in the quarter, 9.5% excluding workers' compensation. Low teens pricing in auto and high-single-digits in general liability, including 14% in excess and umbrella is responding to societal trends. Overall, commercial property pricing has begun to moderate, but was strong in the low-double-digits. All in ex-comp renewal, written pricing and Commercial Lines remain comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing remains slightly positive in the quarter. Before moving to Personal Lines, let me share a few comments we received at our recent annual agent summit. Our broadened product portfolio, increased cross selling opportunities and exceptional talent are resonating with the agent community opening up new business opportunities. Feedback confirms that the marketplace and our top agents recognize our evolution and strength. They appreciate our strong culture and capability to solve customer problems as a unified Commercial Lines team, particularly with small business customers where we are taking advantage of disruption and engaging more than ever with our largest partners to drive efficiency. Our investments in pace and technology were described as compelling and industry leading, and our talent strategy and succession planning was also complemented. Our exceptional Commercial Lines' first-half results and feedback from our partners makes it clear that we have the team, tools, and momen"

Our exceptional Commercial Lines' first-half results and feedback from our partners makes it clear that we have the team, tools, and momentum to capitalize on market opportunities. Turning to Personal Lines, our second quarter financial performance demonstrates continued progress toward target margin improvement. Auto renewal written price increases remain very strong at nearly 24%. While below peak levels from last quarter, they remain consistent with our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. As I have mentioned, we expect auto renewal written price increases for the year to be approximately 20%. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Investments in Personal Lines continued with the launch of dynamic pricing inside our TrueLane telematics offering earlier this month, an enhanced price to risk matching capability aligned with our Prevail product offering. As we return personal auto to profitability in 2024, capabilities like this, along with enhanced risk segmentation, near-term pricing gains, and moderating loss trend, position Personal Lines to reach target margins in 2025. Turning to Group Benefits, our core earnings margin was 10% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first-half of the year. These stellar results included a lower life loss ratio versus the prior year, and continued strong long-term disability execution. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2%, consistent with the first quarter, reflects strong book persistency, still above 90%, and sales of 546 million in the first-half of the year. Moving to investments, the portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic goals, performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. From a macroeconomic standpoint, the U.S. environment continues to be supportive of the Hartford's businesses. The labor market has been resilient and with continued relatively low unemployment and wage rate growth, still in the 4% range, both of which positively affect our two largest and strongest performing lines, workers' compensation and disability. In summary, the Hartford delivered an outstanding quarter with sustained momentum heading into the second-half of the year, a testament to our execution, strategy, talent, and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. As I said before, we continue to build on our market differentiating capabilities in broad product offering, all while becoming more efficient. Our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, and innovative customer-centric technology are expected to sustain superior results. And we continue to proactively manage our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of the Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $750 million or $2.50 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. Commercial Lines had an exceptional quarter with core earnings of $551 million, written premium growth of 11%, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 86.8, further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90. Favorable non-cap property losses contributed to the strong results. Middle & Large Commercial also delivered outstanding results with 13% written premium growth. The strong underlying combined ratio of 89.6 reflects the positive impact of premium leverage, industry-leading pricing and segmentation analytics, and exceptional talent that continue driving profitable growth. Global Specialties written premium growth of 14% was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and strong new business growth, including quarterly net written premium growth of 14% in our wholesale channel. The underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.2, relatively flat to the prior year. Written premium and Personal Lines increased 14% over the prior year, driven by rate execution. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 23.5% and earned pricing increases of 22.1%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.9% for the quarter and 14.6% on an earned basis. In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 improved by five points from the prior year. Homeowners had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.8. We are very pleased with the improvement we are seeing in our auto results. Through June 30th, our underlying combined ratio of 104.7 was in line with our expectations and is 3.8 points lower than the prior year period, almost entirely due to improvement in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve the five to six-point full-year improvement in the auto underlying loss ratio as we have previously discussed. The total Personal Lines expense ratio increased by 0.7 points driven by higher direct marketing costs as anticipated. We have achieved new business rate adequacy in states representing approximately 80% of new business and our contemporary business model enables us to efficiently allocate marketing resources for growth in those states. With respect to catastrophes, TNC current accident year caps were 280 million before tax or 7.1 combined ratio points, which compares to 226 million or 6.2 points on the combined ratio in 2023. While catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. We continue to actively manage our CAD exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk states. Total net favorable prior accident year development within court earnings was $78 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, Personal Lines, and bond, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance, and commercial auto liability. The increase to general liability reserves of $32 million was primarily related to accident years 2015 to 2019, with some modest increases in more recent years. We recorded $37 million before tax in deferred gain amortization related to the Navigator's ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. We have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference. Turning to Group Benefits, core earnings margin of 10% was exceptional. Results reflect strong Group life and disability performance as well as fully insured premium growth. The Group life loss ratio of 74.9 was 9.2 points lower than prior year due to lower claim severity. The Group disability loss ratio of 67.1 was essentially flat with 2023, driven by lower long-term disability claim incidents and a higher New York paid family leave risk adjustment benefit, offset primarily by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products. Fully-insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was consistent with first quarter and reflects positive exposure growth, albeit at a lower rate than in 2023 and strong book persistency at over 90%. Turning to investments, our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A plus and net credit losses remain insignificant. For the quarter, net investment income was $602 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, ex"

The total annualized portfolio yield, exclude limited partnerships was 4.4% before tax, slightly above first quarter. We continue to benefit from higher rates as evidenced by the second quarter reinvestment yield of 6.4%, up 30 basis points from our reinvestment rate in the first quarter and up 110 basis points from the year ago period. As expected, our annualized LP returns of 1.3% were consistent with the first quarter. Although we anticipate LP returns to be somewhat stronger in the second-half of 2024, the full-year is likely to be below 2023 results. However, we remain confident that over the long-term, LPs will generate returns consistent with historical levels. Turning to capital, yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of 3.3 billion which is 10% higher than the 2022 authorization reflecting the strong capital generation of our businesses. This authorization effective August 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 is in addition to the existing authorization, which as of June 30 had approximately 650 million remaining. Over the last several quarters, our share repurchase activity has been very consistent at 350 million per quarter. With our new authorization in place, we would expect quarterly share repurchase activity to be closer to 400 million beginning with the third quarter. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent financial performance through the first six months and these results demonstrate consistent execution in delivering profitable growth contributing to industry leading returns, thereby enhancing value for all stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Beth. We now will take your questions.

Your line is open.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nHi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the commercial pricing environment. Chris, you said, rates improve sequentially, and I think you attribute it to GL as well as excess and umbrella responding to societal issues. Given right, that we've seen, right, reserving issues emerge across the industry, would you expect that your soft pricing trends would just continue on an upward trend from here?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you for the question, Elyse. I would say in general, we're very pleased with our pricing as we quoted 6.6%, up 30 basis points, 9.5%, up to about 20 basis points, even with some moderating property pricing, which you could talk about, but property still remains double-digit, but it's moderating. So, that leaves obviously the liability lines, which again, I'm very proud of our team and their ability to execute and get the needed rate to keep up with, and in most cases, stay ahead of our loss cost trends. So, that's a very important mission guidance that we talk to the team about monthly and quarterly. And I'm looking at Mo, I don't know if you would add anything special, Mo, but your team is doing a great job getting the needed rate, given the environment.\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, I would echo that, Chris. The only additional data point I would give you Elyse is that our excess and umbrella rates were up 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter, so second quarter over the first quarter. So, we continue to work really hard at getting enough rate into the book to respond to the trends that we're seeing. So, Elyse, I don't think the environment is going to let up. So, you should expect us to continue to be disciplined in risk selection and disciplined in pushing for rate in the book. And whether that's at an increasing or a consistent pace, I'm not going to quibble with you, but we're going to be disciplined.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then, my second question is on the new authorization. Beth, and appreciate you gave us, right, the new quarterly kind of run rate on buybacks. Is the incremental uplift, is that all being driven by dividends, out of your property casualty entities? Or, I guess how should we think about the incremental cash flow over the next couple of years?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would say it's really across our businesses. As we said, the fact that the authorization was increased from the previous authorization really is reflective of just the strong earnings generation. As you know dividends quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year can fluctuate a bit as we manage the various legal entities that we have. But we feel very good about the capital generation that we're seeing and we would expect to see our dividends reflect that.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

Wondering if you could share with us, where you're growing, and particularly, I'm interested in the reinsurance area too. What lines of business you're looking at there too?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nAndrew, thank you for joining us today. I would say our specialty business is quite diversified, but if I look at its biggest component, it's wholesale, E&S wholesale, which again uses the full range of our liability and property products. So, feel good about what we're doing there. Rates are strong. We've been increasing the rate that we're seeking on various aspects of that book particularly the liability books. So, again, new distribution relationships, we're expanding the wholesale distribution relationships. And as I said, it culminated in the first time ever going above $1 billion in rent premium. So, we feel really good about that. I'll make a comment on reinsurance and then ask Mo, if he wants to add anything. But our reinsurance business, I would say on a global basis is growing about 18%. I would say 45% of that global reinsurance business is about is property, which is growing at 24%. And then, our non-property casualty lines is growing at 12%. I think I've characterized this before, Andrew, this is going to be a run rate business for us of about $850 million this year. So, it's something that we're proud of. It's a niche. It's being very disciplined and taking advantage of dislocation in the marketplace and producing outstanding superior risk adjusted returns.\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nAndrew, maybe I'll just add a little bit more on the wholesale in Global Specialty. I mean, I think overall, flow continues to be really strong in every product line. We continue to invest in the teams. The teams are executing really well. We are known for our construction casualty prowess. We are underweight in the other parts of wholesale and we're pushing into certainly property on a wider spread, marine. So, just know that we said there's more upside there.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nYes, that's pretty impressive for a business that had a lot of doubters five years ago when you acquired it. So, my next question actually, you know what? Let me just sneak something in unless I get bounced out. That rate that you're talking, the pricing of 9.5% ex-workers' comp, is that pure rate, or is that also inclusive of exposure in terms of conditions and conditions?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. What we typically comment upon if there's a question is, we call it the exposure that access rate. I would say, of the 9.5 is about 2.2% this quarter, fairly consistent with prior quarters.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nGot it. I just want to make sure on that. And then, my other question is, I guess, reading about the reserves focusing on the more difficult adverse, 32 million in GL. That was off 16 to 19, and I think it said in the Q modest 21 to 23. So, that doesn't seem like an impact. Commercial auto was 10 million adverse in the quarter, but that was 2022. Anything we should read into that, Chris, or you feel pretty good about your reserving on the casualty lines and the commercial auto?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I'll let Beth add some detailed commentary, Andrew. But from my chair, knowing our management mechanisms quarterly, what we've debated, how we've picked, I think very, very appropriate loss trends over a five, six year period of time. The resulting balance sheet, I think is very healthy, high confidence. So, yes, these are the things that you work on every quarter and every planning cycle. And we pride ourselves on trying to be realistic and get it right, because if you don't, it has a cumulative effect of you're going to be chasing your tail as they would say. But Beth, would you add any further detailed commentary?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Well, I agree overall with your comments, Chris, as it relates specifically to the reserve increases that we took in commercial auto really related to a couple of accounts and feel really good that we've already taken action on those accounts. So, as you know, we look at our reserves in detail by sub line and where we think we see the need to make an adjustment, we will. But again, I'll echo Chris' comments. When we step back and look at it in total, we do feel very good about where we are.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

So, Chris, and Mo, there was some legislature placed in, I think recently passed in Florida talking about increasing Medicare reimbursements for doctors. And I know that, a lot of kind of workers' comp reimbursement schedules is kind of predicated on that. Can you talk a little bit about what the potential impact is on workers' comp, call it, severity trends are going forward? Are there offsetting factors? Maybe give us a little bit of explanation on that.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Brian, it's Chris. I would say, first, what did they pass? They passed the law that sort of effective January 1 of 2025. So, it does have some applicability for the back book. So, we think that's relatively modest for us. But as you said, it's really physician services across a broad range of services that they're getting basically a pay increase and a pay rate. So, I don't think it really moves the needle on anything materially in Florida. What we then need to do is obviously work with the rating bureaus to make sure that these loss estimates are getting into their guidance and obviously then making the appropriate rate filings and getting paid for that. So, it's a little bit of a lag, but I wouldn't say it's going to change anything from an underwriting appetite or execution. We just need to sort of make sure it gets into filings that the bureaus approve into our pricing, and we'll be off to the races.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):\nGreat. Thanks for the answer. And then, I guess my second question, Chris, you made this comment in response to one of Elyse's questions that property is still seeing double-digit rate. It'd be helpful maybe if you talk about, what it looks like from property rate, large account all the way down to small account because we've heard a lot more that large account is flat to getting more competitive right now. So, it was a little surprising when I heard, you say double-digit rate.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would, I'm going to resist giving you competitive Intel, but I still want to address your question, Brian. So, I would say again last quarter, first quarter in aggregate, ex our Global Reinsurance Property business, we had rates going up 14.1% this quarter on a same basis like-to-like to 12.4%. And I would say that the highest rate increase that we're seeing across our portfolio is in our product for Small Commercial, our E&S binding division within Small Commercial. And then, I would say everything else is sort of in the high-single-digits. So, again, I think quite disciplined, quite appropriate in those lines of business, so I think again as I said the team is executing well. But Mo what would you add?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nProbably, I would just say we don't have a lot that we do in the shared and layered space. But in -- we have a little bit in our Middle and Large Commercial book of shared and layered and a little bit in our Wholesale Property and in Global Specialty. And that's the place we are seeing the most competition, where we rate a 100% in kind of middle market ratings, it's hanging in really well.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS Financial):"

Chris, in your comments you said that you expect to hit the target margins in Personal Lines by 2025. Is that like end of the year 2025? Or, is the beginning of the year, or for the full-year? And I guess the reason why I am thinking about this is on slide 17 of your Investor deck, we are looking at the sequential trends in the auto underlying and the homeowners underlying combined ratio. And it looks like it ticked up a little bit sequentially from the March quarters. So, any color there on how you see that cadence developing over the next 18 months would you helpful.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, happy to comment there. I would say just a couple of things, just context. Your sequential trend is primarily impacted by expense. I think we were pretty clear in our statements that particularly now that we are on a countrywide basis new business rate, and we turned back on marketing in a holistic way whether that would be T.V., whether it would be print, whether it would be paid, and whether it would be advertising and ARP, so data I would say is reverting back to normal. I would say again context, we ended 2023 with a loss cost trends in sort of the mid-teens, and we do expect and we said loss cost trends are moderating. But in essence on a full-year basis, we still think they are going to be low double digits. And that's what we are recording in our financial statements. And then, all I would say is from a target margin perspective, we still see '25 and I would say mid '25 we could get back to our target margins. And the five to six point improvement that we talked about this year, I think, we are on track for it. Particularly as we continue to earn and as loss cost trend continue to moderate in the second-half of the year, but Beth, what would you say?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I agree with everything that you said, Chris. One thing that I would point out when you look at the sequential underlying combined ratio in auto is just keep in mind that first quarter is typically our lowest loss ratio quarter. And we typically see a couple of points every quarter as we go through the year. So, when you put that into the mix combined with what Chris said about the little maybe less than 1 point of expense increase because turning marketing on, I think that shows you that we are making progress relative to that trend. You just have to take in the seasonality into consideration.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nThat makes sense. Okay, for my follow-up question, I am in a pivot to the Benefits business. And I know you called out the 10% core margin results for the second quarter. Is that how we should think about what your objective is in that business over the course of the year? And then related to that, I was looking at some of the sales stats and your supplement, it looks like at least for the June quarter sales were a little bit down on a year-over-year basis. So, some color on the Benefits business would be helpful?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nSure. I would just start by saying we are very, very pleased with the 10% core margin and sort of 8.1% through the six months range which is above our 6% to 7% guide on a long-term basis. But I have always reminded people, Brian -- excuse me, Greg, that that guide is based on making rate guarantees over the next three - four years in certain cases for our products. So, you want to be thoughtful about what can happen over that period of time. But that said, we did call out mortality really improved this quarter. And that's great to see, particularly coming out of the pandemic. But we still believe we're sort of in an endemic state, that mortality would be a little higher over the next couple of years. But I would say we had an outsized benefit this time in the mortality. But everything else is performing well, disability continues to be very steady and a consistent performer. So, I would expect for the remainder of the year for us to continue to outperform our long-term guidance and obviously end the year above the six to seven. But I'm not going to comment on any specifics or any numbers at that point in time. And we'll see then what holds for '25. On the top line in sales, I'd like Jonathan to comment particularly on market conditions, which I generally describe and when he and I talk on a monthly and quarterly basis. I mean, the market is competitive. And I think that there's some impacts on our sales and top line there that we could talk about. But Jonathan, what would you add on premium and top line?\n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI think those are the right comments, Chris. When we're thinking about competition right now, I would say it is heightened. We got in our marketplace a number of capable competitors, some of them relatively new entrants. And any one of them can have different business objectives based on their strategy. I can't speculate on that. And there's always room for reasonable people to have differing views on future loss trend. But our customers are quite sophisticated. Their needs are vast and differentiated. We compete on far more than price. We have absence management capabilities, digital tools, and deep customer focus are all things that distinguish the Hartford. So, when we put it all together, we think we're navigating the market quite well. We're adapting to competitive situations, competing for the business that we believe we want to obtain. We're maintaining underwriting and pricing discipline, which is crucial. We'd always like to be growing faster, but we're focused on the fundamentals of the business.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

Does that mean that when you think about the going forward margins, you are making changes to your current view of margins in workers' comp, and the loss picks are coming down in current years? Or maybe you're just skeptical that this favorability can last forever. How do you think about that actuarially, and how does that play into the stability or actually improvement in your commercial loss picks overall compared to a year ago?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Josh, Beth and I are a tag team here. I would generally say, again, when we entered this year to where we are today, we're virtually right on where we thought. And remember, we did make some commentary that we thought we would experience some modest margin contraction heading into 2024, and I would say that continues to be maybe less modest or more modest, depending on how you want to say it. But it's obviously a line that we know well and know the components. So, I think it's all working as expected. I'm sure between Beth and I, we could tell you that our frequency and severity assumptions are holding. Our wage inflation assumptions were probably a little light, and we're outperforming there. So, you put it all together, and it works. It's working. It's still a highly profitable line of business for us that contributes meaningfully. And yes, we're watching all the drivers of loss cost trends very, very closely, as you would expect a company of our expertise and skills in this area. But Beth, what would you add?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, again, Chris, I agree with how you characterized it. And what I would say, Josh, is we take into consideration this is a long-tailed line. So, when we make our picks relative to loss trend, we take that into consideration. We obviously look at what's happening in the near term. But one of the areas I know we've talked about in the past is medical inflation. We still are holding that 5% trend in our reserves and our pricing. We've seen some, continue to see some frequency benefit, and we build some of that in as well. But we, our philosophy is we just need to be steady as we think about those loss trends. And then, obviously, we've been talking about what we're seeing on the rate side. So, that's why we're feeling a little bit of that compression. But we, again, understand this is a long-tailed line, and we want to be very thoughtful with our loss picks.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nJust to synthesize the two things you said. So, the pick is slightly higher, but that's pricing driven. Is that right?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, I would say it's loss cost driven, impacted by the rate environment. So, when we said we're expecting some margin compression, our loss trends, which are generally consistent, are impacting, have the rate effect of pricing. So, when pricing continues to be sort of less than positive, and is not covering your cost of goods sold on an assumption basis, you're going to have some slight margin compression, and that's what we're feeling.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay. So, that's actually where I want to go. But obviously, the numbers are getting better. So, in general liability, and I guess attritional property, are the initial picks improving at the backdrop of a little bit more caution on the workers' comp picks? I'm still trying to look at the moving pieces on where the trend is. Are things getting better right now? I ask this because arguably some of your competitors might have said things before you reported the quarter that give people the impression that things are getting worse. And yes, I'm trying to figure out if that's right or wrong.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nWell, you're smart. You'll figure it out. But again, from the pure comp line, I would say it's steady.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd then, the non-comp longer tail lines?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNow, again, those are very detailed conversations by product line. But I would characterize at least our views of where we're at and how we're executing. My view is I think we have appropriate and compelling loss trends baked into our picks going back five years. And our ability to execute on a rate side consistently and in those strong double digits, particularly in the liability lines, over an extended period of time puts us in a good place because I always comment every quarter that I think we're staying ahead of trend, loss trend, with our pricing. So, I'll look at Beth and/or Mo if they want to add anything additional.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I'll add a couple points. So, again, on the liability lines, as Chris has said, we feel very good about the loss trend that we've been building into our picks. And pricing has been above that, as well as the fact that we've been taking underwriting actions for a number of years, which also has the effect of sort of stabilizing those loss picks, so, all that feels very good. And then, the one area that we called out relative to performing slightly better than our expectations this quarter was in the non-cap property line, primarily in Small Commercial. And that line quarter-to-quarter, you can see some just normal volatility in that. But overall, I would say when you look at all of our loss picks and what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, things are in line with that.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

I don't know what to say other than our 5% long-term medical inflation trend, or below that. We've said in the past that maybe medical trend is ticked up just a little bit from two-ish to maybe three-ish, which I think still applies. We never talked about frequency trends just because we don't. So, sorry to disappoint you, but I think we've given you enough.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. No, I figure it would be worth a try. And then, maybe moving to Group Benefits, and I know I asked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it sounds like I'm harping on this. I don't mean to. I do think that as underwriters obviously the art is balancing between margin and growth. And considering just what seems to be like sustainable outperformance on the margin side, I would be curious to hear more about maybe why not give a little bit more on the pricing in order to achieve more growth. And I know that last quarter you talked about taking the life pricing up a bit because of the endemic expectations. But are you overshooting there?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):"

So, the margin for error there is really, really tight. And we don't want to have any errors. So, we don't want to have any whoopsies. So, that discipline is there. The disabilities generally, three year rate guarantees. So, a little different than sort of short, pale P&C businesses, which you get to reprice every six or 12 months. So, that's where the additional caution and mechanisms come into play when you're making those medium term commitments. But Jonathan, what would you add?\n\nJonathan Bennett - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nChris, only that I'd like it to be more like a dial. And I could turn it two clicks and I could trigger something to that effect. But Yaron, it doesn't really work that way. So, we get into, in particular, when you're in some of the larger market. The cases do have data credibility. We get a lot of information. We pour through that and we position ourselves to compete hard. So, there is no shortage of work on our part to be digging into that environment and to win those cases. And we'll keep at it. If we find ourselves off by more than we feel comfortable with, then we feel like the discipline of walking away is the right answer. And we'll continue to exercise that prudence. But make no mistake about it. We're interested in competing hard for the growth. And we will continue to work at that, staying true to our outlook on trend and our expectations and requirements for profitability as well.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nThank you.

I'm just following up on comments and the prepared remarks about the Hartford's continued mix shift to property and maybe versus a prior comment about some pressure from workers' comp on commercial margins, could you talk a little bit about how that mix shift might help those margins and if that's potentially enough to offset any of that pressure?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would share with you, Peter. Obviously, it depends on your view of loss picks. But generally, property is going to have a lower loss ratio, combined ratio than comp given its long tail duration. So, that's just the obvious. If you mix more of that in the overall portfolio of underlying combined ratio particularly will go down. I think we've talked about it in the past that we are willing to grow in property principally because we've made so many investments that allow us to compete thoughtfully and earn good returns with good risk management tools, with a diversified portfolio that doesn't have outsized CAT to it. So, again, it's just not just because we want to grow. I mean, we have to have the capabilities to. And we have worked really, really hard and invested a lot of time and energy over the last five years to put ourselves in a position to compete today to earn good risk adjusted returns. So, I think that's an important component. I think the other component I'll just give you is, I think we're on track to come close to $3 billion of written premium this year, which would be up from $2 billion couple of years back and growing nicely in sort of that 20% range, I think I said in my prepared remarks. So, you put it all together, and we're competing well in an environment where there's a lot of disruption and a lot of complexity, but we're able to navigate it because of the investments and skills and talented people we have in the building today.\n\nPeter Knudsen - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nOkay, great. Thank you. And just following up on a prior question, I know we talked about national account pricing, so I won't get into that. But national accounts did see large growth this quarter, a decent acceleration from the first quarter. So, I'm wondering if maybe you guys could just talk a little bit about the opportunity you're seeing there and what was driving that?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Peter, it's Mo. The national accounts business, which is really our large casualty business with deductibles, I think the quarter-over-quarter compares to the sequential quarter is a hard compare because the renewal date is really different. That business has chunky renewal dates. So, I would think the year-over-year quarter compares a better one. But overall, we feel incredibly good about the national accounts book. That is a disciplined underwriting process. The teams are doing well. We want to grow it. We did win some new business in the second quarter, but I think the best compare is the second quarter of last year."

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on the Hartford's website for one year. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we discuss our results, I want to extend our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. These storms have been wide-ranging and devastating. In times like these, I'm especially proud of the Hartford's claims handlers, adjusters and leaders. Our team is working tirelessly to support every customer impacted by these storms. Turning to our results. The Hartford's third quarter performance is a powerful example of sustained financial excellence, even in the face of industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses, and liability severity trends. Our excellent performance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing investments to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We remain focused on disciplined underwriting, pricing execution, expanding product and distribution breadth, developing exceptional talent and delivering a superior customer experience. Highlights from the third quarter include top-line growth in Commercial Lines of 9% with double-digit new business growth, strong renewal written pricing increases and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.6. Personal Lines top-line growth of 12%, with over 5 points of underlying margin improvement, an impressive Group Benefits core earnings margin of 8.7% and continued solid performance in our investment portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. In addition, yesterday, we were pleased to announce an 11% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 3, 2025. This is a continuation of our track record of annual dividend increases and another proof point of earnings power and strong capital generation. Now let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines continues to produce excellent results with strong top-line growth and an underlying combined ratio below 90% for the 14th straight quarter reflecting our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements. New business growth in small commercial and middle market was once again well into double-digits. Retention was steady and the environment remains conducive for growth. As I've highlighted in the past, the breadth of our product offerings, extensive distribution network, and strategic investments in technology allow us to provide comprehensive and tailored solutions, which gives us a competitive advantage with small-and-medium sized enterprises. Our emphasis on ease, simplicity, and speed ensures that our customers and distribution partners experience seamless interactions and quick response. The strength enable us to offer more precise and competitive pricing, enhancing our market position. Additionally, our product capabilities help us to support customers as their businesses grow. We expect to continue to gain market share, while maintaining highly profitable margins. A prime example of Hartford's SME market leadership is our small commercial business, which once again had an outstanding quarter with strong top-line growth and margins. New business premium was up 26% in the quarter, in part driven by a 31% increase in quotes and a doubling of E&S binding premium, a business where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. We take pride in our robust business system and associated insights, which drives our rate strategy and segmentation, giving us significant edge that's a challenge for others to match. With another quarter of exceptional results, and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our small commercial business. Moving to Middle and Large Commercial. Third quarter performance was strong including 8% top-line growth, paired with an underlying margin that has consistently hovered around 90% or better for the past eight quarters. We continue to take advantage of elevated submission flow driven in part by investments made to expand our product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution along with a 28% increase in middle market new business with growth across nearly all products led by property. We have built a track record of delivering meaningful growth, while consistently maintaining underlying margins, a result we expect to sustain going forward. In Global Specialty, we achieved excellent results with underlying margins in the mid-80s and a record quarterly earned premium approaching $850 million. Strong top-line growth reflects our competitive position, diverse product offerings and solid renewal pricing. Gross written premium growth of 9% was driven by a 17% increase in our wholesale business, including 10% in property as well as significant contributions from auto and excess casualty and global reinsurance. Across Commercial Lines, our continued emphasis on property expansion has resulted in premium growth of approximately 20% this quarter, putting us on track to achieve our full-year target of $3 billion. We remain confident in and continue to capitalize on market conditions that support earnings strong risk-adjusted returns through a disciplined strategy, while maintaining a stable and consistent approach to catastrophe risk management. As for pricing, in Commercial Lines, renewal written pricing excluding workers' compensation, of 9.5% was relatively consistent with the second quarter. Low teens pricing in auto and high single-digits in general liability are responding to societal trends. Umbrella and excess pricing was in the mid-teens. Overall commercial property pricing remained strong in the low-double digits with mid-to-u"

Overall commercial property pricing remained strong in the low-double digits with mid-to-upper teens property pricing within our small commercial package product. Commercial Lines overall loss trends are stable with some moderation in both property and financial line severity, offset by higher severity in liability. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. Turning to Personal Lines. Our third quarter financial performance demonstrates continued margin improvement. We saw a seven point improvement in the auto, underlying combined ratio and are on track to achieve target margins in mid-2025. Auto renewal written price increases remained very strong at approximately 20%. Pricing declines from peak levels remain consistent with our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Turning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin was an impressive 8.7% for the quarter. Continued strong group life results and long-term disability execution are the primary drivers. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2%, consistent with the first half of the year, reflects strong book persistency still above 90% and sales of $105 million in the quarter. Moving to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. Before I turn the call over to Beth, I would like to share some insights from this year's Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers Annual Conference. Last year, we provided an update on CIAB where the strength of our franchise was a consistent theme. This year, our partners amplified that strength, highlighting our innovative digital tools, comprehensive product offerings, and our robust innovation agenda. They praised our consistent strategy and execution over the years. Additionally, they expressed a strong desire to expand their business with us viewing our team as best-in-class and noting that our relationships have never been stronger. In summary, the Hartford delivered an excellent quarter, a testament to our execution strategy talent and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. As I've said before, we continue to build on our market differentiating capabilities and broad product offerings all while becoming more efficient. Our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer centric technology are expected to sustain superior results and we continue to proactively manage our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of the Hartford in our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $752 million or $2.53 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. Commercial Lines had an excellent quarter with core earnings of $534 million, written premium growth of 9%, and an underlying combined ratio of 88.6. Through the first nine months, the underlying combined ratio of 88.1 is in line with the prior year and our expectations. Small Commercial continues to deliver outstanding results with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.3, slightly better than the prior year. These results were driven by favorable non-CAT property losses somewhat offset by a higher loss ratio and general liability, both within our packaged product. Middle & Large Commercial delivered strong results as written premiums rose 8% and new business growth accelerated. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 90.2 compares to 88.1% in the prior year, reflecting a level of non-CAT property losses more consistent with our expectations compared to favorable experience in the prior year and an increase in the general liability and auto loss ratios, partially offset by a shift in business mix towards property line and the positive impact of premium leverage on the expense ratio. Global Specialty results include written premium growth of 9% and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.3. The underlying combined ratio increased one point over the prior year quarter primarily due to a higher loss ratio in global reinsurance driven by losses in Latin America, where we have taken underwriting actions to reduce our exposure to these risk profiles and a higher expense ratio compared to prior year due to a higher commission ratio driven by changes in mix of business. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 12% over the prior year, driven by rate execution. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 20.8% and earned pricing increases of 22.7%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 15.2% and 14.8% on an earned basis. In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.3 points from the prior year. The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 75.4 improved 2.7 points primarily due to the impact of double-digit earned pricing outpacing loss costs, partially offset by a higher expense ratio. We are very pleased with the progress in our auto results. For the quarter, the auto underlying combined ratio of 101.5, improved seven points from 108.5 in third quarter 2023. Through September 30th, the underlying combined ratio of 103.6 is 4.9 points lower than the prior year period, including 5.3 points of loss ratio improvement. The Personal Lines expense ratio of 25.6 increased 1.4 points, primarily driven by higher planned direct marketing costs and higher incentive compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premiums. P&C current accident year CAT were $247 million before tax or six combined ratio points, which compares to $184 million or 4.9 points on the combined ratio in the prior year period. We continue to actively manage our CAT exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline. Additionally, we have a robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. As a reminder, we have a $200 million aggregate cover, which attaches when subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Through September 30th, catastrophe losses subject to treaty were $660 million, leaving $90 million before we reach the attachment point. The aggregate cover does not include losses from the Global Reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. Our estimated losses for Hurricane Milton are in the range of $65 million to $110 million pretax, which includes $25 million to $40 million for Global Re. Therefore, at the high end of the range, we would be just under the aggregate attachment point. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $24 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation and personal auto physical damage partially offset by reserve increases in general liability and commercial auto liability. The increase in general liability reserve of $32 million reflects a higher frequency of large losses including losses in more recent accident years. We continue to monitor liability trends closely, making minor adjustments to our underwriting and pricing strategies, including adjustments that are incorporated in our current year loss pick. We recorded $26 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no i"

      "raw_bytes": "ents that are incorporated in our current year loss pick. We recorded $26 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. As a reminder, we conduct our annual asbestos and environmental study in the fourth quarter. We have $62 million of coverage remaining on the A&E ADC, so any development over that amount will impact core earnings. Turning to Group Benefits. We had another strong quarter with a core earnings margin of 8.7%. Results demonstrate ongoing strength in group life and long-term disability along with growth in fully insured premiums. The group life loss ratio of 77.5 improved by 2.7 points compared to prior year due to lower mortality. The group disability loss ratio of 67.9 increased 60 basis points due to a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products, largely offset by a favorable change in the long-term disability recovery rate assumptions. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was consistent with the first half of the year, and reflects positive exposure growth and strong book persistency at over 90%. The group benefits expense ratio of 25.3 increased 1.3 points from the prior year third quarter primarily due to higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefit costs and increased investments in technology. Turning to investments. Our diversified and growing portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains strong with an average credit rating of A+ and no net credit losses in the quarter. For the quarter, net investment income was $659 million. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.5% before tax, 10 basis points above second quarter. We continue to benefit from higher rates, security selection, and accretive trading activity as evidenced by the third quarter reinvestment yield exceeding the sales and maturity yield by 110 basis points. As anticipated, our annualized LP returns of 3% were higher than the first half of the year as private equity and real estate performance continues to improve. We remain confident that over the long-term, LPs will generate returns consistent with historical levels. Turning to capital management. As Chris mentioned, we increased our common quarterly dividend by 11%. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of the year. We believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns thereby enhancing value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

Two questions here. The first one, general liability, the increase in loss picks this quarter, was there any kind of current year development in that increase in the underlying loss ratio in commercial this quarter?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nBrian, thanks for the question. I'll let Beth answer that. But I think I just would want you to have a little context on what we saw this quarter that required that $32 million adjustment. And I really would say it's just two simple things. Our data is just simply showing more attorney representation claims of all sizes. So the percentage of claims coming in with attorney representation is high and is getting higher. And we talked about it in the past, the average settlement rate of claims or the dollars that we're paying for average claims, including sort of simple slip and falls is increasing rapidly. So you put that -- those two components together, and that's ultimately why we adjusted our prior year. Beth, I think you could provide a little bit more detail.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Thank you, Chris. So Brian, on your question on the increase that we recorded in the current year for liability in the quarter. Yes, that would include some true-up for the first and second quarter. So I would quantify that, if you think about in the quarter, we probably booked a little bit over a point from the prior year and two-thirds of that would relate to the first six months.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. And then on that, Chris, just kind of how are you thinking about given what you're talking about with GL development, obviously going up a little bit. Does it make you pause at all about some of the new business that you're putting on and the growth you're putting on in the middle market area to kind of make sure that you're adequately capturing what kind of real trend is looking like in your pricing and terms and conditions in that business?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would just say simply, no, we're very confident in the new business that we're putting on I'm looking at MO, he could give you a little bit of the history lesson that we've talked about. And really, the improvement that we've made in our data science, our analytics, our pricing tools, our segmentation and all that improvement we've made in the book. And I still feel good about where we're at MO. I don't know if you would add anything else.\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nBrian, a couple of additions. I mean, I think we've talked to you a lot about the work that we've done, especially in middle and large commercial and global specialty to reduce in some of the areas that we were worried about. So we've been working on limits management, we've been working on jurisdictions. We've been working on kind of the underlying fleet sizes and certainly a lot of rate. And I think that's paying off. You look at our frequency of claims, it's down. And it has been -- when you look at the '20 to '23 versus the prior years, your frequency of claims is down, so it's paying off. What we're seeing is, to Chris' point, where there the lawyers are involved, it's down less. And so we watch this environment in real time. And we've got higher pricing standard for all of the Commercial Lines underwriters in certain jurisdictions in certain classes. So we feel really pretty good about our ability to execute through this. We're watching it closely. And maybe a little bit of context to finish with the growth that we've put on over the past three years, our nine-month underlying combined ratio is right on where it was last year, and we think that's an evidence of us executing pretty well on our pricing strategies.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

With the improvement gradually emerging, I'm just curious how you think about your longer-term combined ratio target in the Personal Lines business? I know some of your competitors have very specific numbers in terms of like 96 or 95 or et cetera. So maybe you could provide some perspective on where you think that's going to go to?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGreg, it's Chris. I would, I'm going to reframe from giving you exact targets other than what we've always talked about of getting back to overall profitability back to our targets. And that's roughly our 15% to 17% ROE that we're targeting. That does have a corresponding combined ratio, including CAT load even in for auto. So I'm going to just kind of hesitate a little bit about just dumping out a number just because -- that's the first priority is that we want to continue to improve our profitability. We're about 85% of the states in the country rate adequate now. So we're feeling good about getting the rate that we need into book and executing to that. But I'm going to pause on and giving you any targets especially for next year.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. That's fair enough. I guess I'll just come at it from a slightly different angle just on, if I look at the homeowners business, the underlying improvement in the combined ratio, there was some, but if I look at the rate slide that you put up in your supplement, mid-teens types of rate increases that you're getting in homeowners consistently quarter-after-quarter. I guess I'm surprised that the underlying combined ratio has improved more. So maybe you could provide some perspective on that.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Actually, I think we feel really good about where our overall trends are in homeowners, both from an attritional side and even a CAT side, we're pretty close to hitting our target margins there in total, Greg. So I don't know how to respond to your sort of disappointment, but loss cost trends are increasing. That's why we are putting the rate in there. Attritional is behaving. And obviously, CAT was elevated during the quarter, and it's a little elevated for the full-year in homeowners. But overall, it's still like what we're doing with that book of business and particularly with our new product and chassis, we call prevail that I know you're familiar with. It's -- I think it's performing very nicely from a new business side. I'm looking at Melinda Thompson, I'll just ask Melinda, would you add any color?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Chief Claims Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI think you covered it well, Chris. The only thing I would add is that as you look at the rate and increases to value that we put into market, we feel that they're comfortably ahead of loss trend.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. Fair enough. I wouldn't characterize my questions as disappointment, just trying to understand the numbers. But thanks for your answers."

And then when I looked at the rate increases that you described, and I backed in workers' comp. But back of the envelope, I get about 3% policy in force growth. Could you talk about the ability to gain share and maybe each of those three components of commercial and the outlook for growth there?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. How about if we tag team. I'll start and MO, you could add your color. I would say, across all the commercial, Andrew, we're just really pleased. You could look at small and see sort of the quotes up. We're cross-selling more of our global specialty products into there. We're growing E&S very rapidly at strong margins. Likewise, with large and small commercial submission flows up, hit rates are relatively stable. But again, all the investments we've made in our pricing, our data science, everything we just talked about, I think is paying off. And then Global Specialty, particularly the wholesale division there, which is our main E&S chassis, it's performing at a high level. It's growing rapidly with some of our most highly partnered E&S brokers. So I put it all together, MO, and I mean we feel good. And as I said, we're still in an environment, Andrew, that I think is very conducive to growth, whether it be in the standard lines or the E&S lines and I believe we are taking market share with our differentiated capabilities. But MO, what would you add?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, just maybe to reinforce a couple of points. I mean I think, Andrew, the flow in all three businesses, as we've talked about in prior quarters, remains strong. As Chris was talking about, the pricing environment is, we think, conducive supportive. I would say the pricing environment is largely consistent with what we talked about last quarter, and then that's a good environment. You won't see us growing workers confident. You asked specifically about workers' comp. You don't feel it's growing that at a much different pace. It's basically a flat in the quarter from a written premium perspective, and maybe just to build on Chris' CIAB point, coming out of that meeting, it gave us great confidence that those flows to us will continue. And we feel really good that with those opportunity flows the way our underwriters and sales teams are executing that will take advantage of it.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nExcellent. And shifting over to Group Benefits. You again came in at a compelling margin of 8.7%, well above your 6% to 7% guidance. Can you talk about kind of the trajectory of going back to that level and the competitive landscape that you're seeing in group benefits.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I'll start, Andrew, and then I'll ask Mike Fish to add his market color. I would say I'm pleased with our performance in total whether it be on the margin side or an underwriting side, sales are down a little bit, 15% from prior year, but we sort of signaled that we thought we were operating in a highly competitive environment. And that we might have a different point of view on mortality trends where we're still pricing for endemic state, which you could see in our numbers, our life sales are down a little bit. I'm really pleased with a lot of the new products that we're bringing to market, particularly in the absence area and all our paid family and paid medical lead products that is having a little bit of a compare challenge between years where we had a lot more new business opportunities and paid family medical leave that are not run ratable going forward. But Mike Fish, what would you add as far as your market color?\n\nMike Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nChris, I would add just a couple of comments there. It's a competitive market. And -- but I'd also say our new business activity is strong. So our sales team is active in the market. With our brokers, you noted on the life side, pricing for that endemic state. So that is putting a bit of pressure on the new life sales front. But I'd end by saying our persistency is strong. We're still well north of 90%, which is on the high end of the historical range. And really, we're looking to avoid situations where price is the only driver. And we're going to compete fiercely when we have an opportunity to sell our product and service capabilities.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

I would say the 1125 particularly from a national account perspective, is largely done. We'll give you a little bit more color on our next quarterly results. But I feel good about them where we're at and how we compete it, how we're differentiating ourselves with some of our service capabilities. So that's all I'm going to say right now until we just officially close out the year. But it is, I guess, a competitive market. I said it, Mike Fish has said it and we're trying to pick our spots where we think we could make good margins over a longer period of time with appropriate rate guarantees. Inherently, there is some conservatism in our pricing when you think of three to four to five year rate guarantees. So -- but again, generally, very, very pleased.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then I guess just a follow-up. Thinking about group disability, we've obviously been in a volatile macro environment. I mean, to what extent have you seen any new trends emerge this year from a claims perspective on the disability side. I mean have you? Or has it just kind of been more of the same as what you saw in '23 going to?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I would say more of the same. There isn't anything to call out. I mentioned our absence in paid family leave and medical plan. So we're in six states. We'd like that product line. It's very complementary to what we're doing with disability. It's actually a product line that consumers are more aware of and are using it and employers value it. So that's probably the only new thing, I would say, over the last two or three years' worth calling out at this point in time, Ryan.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nThanks, Chris."

As we look at the post-COVID cohort start to age a little bit, can you give us maybe a little bit of color on how that book is developing. Should we expect similar level of reserve releases or reserve development rather going forward from that part of the book?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI'll let Beth add her color, but I would say less or more and more, we're making less of a distinction between COVID years, post-COVID, pre-COVID and just running it, I'll call it in an aggregate basis and looking at aggregate trends. But Beth, what would you add?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. What I would say is on workers' comp as it relates to and this relates to all of our reserves, we evaluate them every quarter, and we'll make adjustments accordingly. But I can't offer any predictions on what reserve development would be in the future. As it relates to years' post-COVID, so I think it's sort of '21, '22, '23, those reserves are still very young. And so as typical, we wait to see how those season before we would start to make any adjustments.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. But maybe one other thing on workers' comp really is the weaker or perhaps even a negative pricing environment. As you think about the business going forward, it's still incredibly profitable. What are some of the key focuses that we should really look into? Are you also -- are you really worried about the rising medical cost inflation, things of that nature around workers' comp?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I would share with you, there isn't really anything new. I think everything that you talked about, we would say the trends are generally stable, particularly on the medical severity side. We're still within our assumption of 5% from a long-term side. It could bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, but the overall trend, I still think is encouraging. And as you said it, I mean, it's a highly profitable line particularly for those that lead the industry, which we think we're one of the leaders in the industry. So yes, we'll be selective on new business and going to be sensitive on states that are maybe taking bigger price adjustments going forward. But from an overall side, we still like it. It's contributing mightily to our earnings growth and profile. And generally, we feel good on all the assumptions that we manage to, Beth.

If I take out the current year prior quarter, still looks solid at 56.6 or 56.7, that sort of range. Was there anything else in there that you would characterize as being one-off or unsustainable either way? I know there were a few moving pieces between small commercial and middle market and large with the non-CAT property losses. But I just wanted to make sure I understand the baseline here. Thank you.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I'll ask Beth to provide any her insights, David. But I would say -- and I put our expense ratio in there. We come up with 88.1 through the nine months, which we feel terrific about. MO mentioned that before. That means we're executing well. It's generally consistent with prior year that we've talked about. I would say from a macro side, we feel good about the non-CAT property losses this year. I would say maybe they're just slightly ahead of our expectations and then offset by some of the GL movements that we've made there. But you put those two pieces together and still come up with an 88.1 with the fourth quarter to go. Yes, the team feels really good about that, David. But Beth, what would you say?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, David, the only thing I'd point out, which you referenced was when you look at all-in on commercial lines, a little bit of favorability in non-CAT property primarily in small commercial. But I mean we're talking about tens of basis points here, nothing significant that I would call out.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nOkay. Yes, that's helpful. Nothing big there. Okay. Thanks for that. And then not big numbers, but commercial auto also continues to develop adversely. I know, Beth, last quarter, you spoke about those reserve increases being related to a few specific accounts. I guess, was it the same story this quarter what sort of -- would it -- what would it take for you guys to like a step back and think about if some of those trends that are impacting a few accounts would start to be more pervasive across the book.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. So I would characterize what we saw this quarter is very consistent with last quarter. So again, on some specific accounts within certain lines. And I'll just remind you that we increased our loss pick on commercial auto in the fourth quarter of last year, just addressing sort of the more macro trends. And so when we look at where we are with the current year, we feel very good with our loss picks and feel that we've incorporated some of sort of the broader, I would say, market impacts. But MO, would you add anything else?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Maybe just, David, from an underwriting perspective, I think we've talked about it, but -- we've certainly been managing accounts that were impacting us, and these are accident years '22 and '23 as a reminder. We've been either moving them to loss sensitive if they got a larger fleet. We're moving them out altogether. Certainly, we're pushing rate and continue to push rate hard in the auto lines. And just maybe the last piece is the only place we really have any heavy trucking exposure is in our wholesale book, it's less than $150 million. And we're very transactional in that space. So I think we really feel good about the underlying auto exposure across Commercial Lines.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGreat, thank you."

And I just want to preface clearly, the results overall are excellent, but we're going to get a lot of questions on general liability. So I wanted to focus another question there. In the prepared remarks, you gave us good color about more Attorney rep on all claims sizes. Is there any way you could kind of parse it out more? Because I think that what we're seeing in the industry is that the -- on the small commercial side more so than the large commercial side, we're seeing more -- the loss trend rise more so than in the large account space because there's just more Attorney involvement. I've learned historically on larger clients, like larger Fortune 500 clients. So I just wanted to better understand if you are seeing the higher GL trends in any specific pockets based on account size or maybe type of employer or business that could happen.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nMike, all I would say, yes, there's lawyers everywhere. All 50 states, all the territories, obviously, looking for clients in which way they can from advertising or 1-800 numbers. So I'm being fastidious obviously, because we don't see any discernible trend. I think the -- what we called out and what we're reacting to is the more higher percentage of claims coming in the door with Attorneys already in tow, and that's driving up overall settlement rates no matter what business, what country or state and that's what we see. But MO, anything from the underwriting side, you would comment upon.\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nWell, I would say, and I don't think we should need to get into the details, but just know that we're deep in every jurisdiction, we're in by class, we're in by the type of accident. So I think there's a lot of nuance here but Chris' overall point, there's more lawyers around, but certainly, when we get to the underwriting, we're tailoring it by industry, by state, by county, and certainly, any underperforming areas are getting the necessary rate action and book management activity.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful. And maybe just switching gears a bit to the overall commercial rate environment. It feels like the industry is being extremely disciplined. We're seeing pricing increase a bit in many lines despite overall industry return on equity levels being healthy to excellent. Would you say that the pricing environment is really being driven more by loss ratio and your folks and your peers aren't really taking into account the investment income benefit as much as I think maybe some investors thought would take place in recent years? Just kind of curious about the competitive environment.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I would say, again, Mike, I think it's rational and thoughtful and principally driven by loss trends, right? I mean I can't speak to any other competitors and how they really think or manage. But at least from our side, I mean, we start with trends, and we've always said we're trying to hold margins where we're at today. Underwriting margins feel good that, again, we're generally consistent with last year, and we'll start to talk about '25, a little bit more. But we don't -- from an underwriting side, we don't think about net investment income. All our metrics are sort of elastic except when you get into maybe the national account book of business that does have a little bit more float there. But I think it's primarily loss cost-driven MO and we're executing to what we're trying to do from a consistency perspective.\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. But Mike, that doesn't mean it's easy. I just want to make sure you understand, it's a difficult underwriting environment. And if you don't give the right tools to underwriters, if you aren't making investments in the data science and the feedback loops to see the stuff, you're going to miss it. And so I just want to make sure we are talking about the difficult choices underwriters are making every day. And I think our team is doing a terrific job navigating the market.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

My first question, I guess, going into -- on the premium growth side, within middle and large growth did slow a little bit in the quarter. And I know it was a little -- an easier comp last year, especially right when I look at growth within the middle market right around 7% this quarter, a little lower what we saw so far year-to-date. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you were seeing there in the quarter and how we should expect that to trend from here?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Elyse, you're right on. We certainly commented on July last year, the market just didn't come our way. But we're really excited about -- I think our year-to-date growth in middle and large commercial is 9.9%. We're really excited about that. As we talked about a minute ago, the flow continues to be really strong. Our underwriters are active in the marketplace. And again, coming out of CIB, I use that as a reference point since it's so recent. I think our agents are really talking about their desire to consolidate carriers and that would -- we would benefit from that in the middle and large commercial space. So I think as long as we can get paid for risk and the market holds up, we feel really good about the growth possibilities in the middle and large commercial.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then I just want to come back to GL for a second as well, right? So we saw adverse development right on some more recent years this quarter, last quarter was some softer here. It sounds like it was just, Chris, the Attorney representation that you were talking to that kind of was the driver of both. Can you just -- and I know you touched on it in prepared remarks, give us a sense of the severity kind of assumptions that you're assuming within GL. And is there like a buffer that -- like give us a sense of the buffer you have on top of kind of what you're seeing just so we can -- that you would expect not to see additional movements from here?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I would share with you, Elyse, and thanks for the question. I'm not going to talk about buffers or how we manage sort of in total. But yes, you're right. The data that we're reacting to this quarter is rep rates and settlement rates particularly on our bread and butter small commercial and middle market accounts, slip and falls, particularly, that type of claim seems to have the most explosive growth in settlement values there. So I think that's the color that I would provide, Beth, but would you add anything else?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, I think you covered it well. I mean, we reacted to what we saw and incorporated that as well as our projections for what we would see going forward. The adverse development that we took in '22 and '23 and then how that informed our view of changing our pick for '24. So from our perspective, we've taken all of those inputs in and made our best call.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Thank you.\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I think the expense ratio, there's nothing to call out. I think last quarter, we called out we were started or restarted our national advertising and solicitation through -- for our direct response business. I'd expect it to normalize and go down over time, particularly as we have more operating leverage as we start to grow again. So that's about it.\n\nUnidentified Analyst - Analyst (KBW):\nGot it. Thank you. My second question is on E&S growth. You previously targeted $300 million in E&S binding by end of the year. Could you provide an update on the progress and discuss with the social inflation driving more submission to the E&S channel?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I think the overall trend of E&S continued to be a meaningful channel for both casualty and property products is very strong. Obviously, they're capturing more of the flow on the small side in the middle market side, we're happy to participate with what we think is a pretty good offering and a pretty good mousetrap. We're on track to achieve our $300 million goal that we set this year, particularly in small commercial E&S binding. And it's an important channel for us to continue to develop capabilities and underwriting skills to support over the long-term. But Mo, would you add anything?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, I agree with everything on E&S binding, and I would just reinforce, we're seeing the same momentum in the wholesale space within Global Specialty and in property and inland marine in construction and casualty in total. So we feel really good about the progress in both segments.\n\nUnidentified Analyst - Analyst (KBW):"

How is everyone doing this morning?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nIt's good to hear your voice, Josh. What is on your mind?\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nGood to hear. I want to talk about the sales growth looked a little weak year-over-year, but these are a lot of times multiyear sales cycles. So the year-over-year comparison might not be apt. And of course, the first quarter is more important than the third quarter. But can we talk a little bit about sales conversion, given a number of companies -- a number of companies coming from renewal, how well you did this year and what that augurs for in the future, especially maybe how many contracts are coming up for renewal in '25?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. We're not going to talk too much about '25 right now, Josh, but we'll give you plenty of color once it's all tidied up. I would say, and Mike Fish will add his perspective, we still feel good about obviously, our sales team and what we're able to do in the marketplace and all our broker relationships. I mean it's quite an ecosystem that you have to manage with feet on the street and relationships. And when we get a lot of opportunities, I think the comp issue that I talked about, we had some onetime PFL and PML sales last year. So that's distorting it. If you take it out, we're still down, but we're down just slightly. And Mike, I don't know what you would provide to Josh to give him comfort that we're competing every day as hard as we can. But we're also trying to make money and we're being disciplined with our pricing also.\n\nMike Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, Chris, those are the right points. I'd just add a couple of items here. On the renewal side, Think of it this way, a little under a third of our book comes up for renewal every year, and I noted earlier in my comments around this year's persistency north of 90%. Now that's on the whole book. So renewal is a subset. But again, I think that just speaks to the fact that we're able to compete certainly on our in-force and keeping those customers. On the new side, our volume of quotes that we're seeing is consistent year-over-year. What I would sort of -- if I double-click under that, when you look on the larger end, those opportunities can ebb and flow over the years. And essentially, when we're looking to line-up with our underwriting appetite, we're going to be a bit more selective on the large end. But again, I don't think there's anything you need to note this year, very consistent with what we've seen in the past years.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nWell, I just want to take your comment, Chris, is that we are here to make money, and I think that's right. You definitely are making money in the group around this business. The margins are fantastic. Is that showing up not necessarily in the Hartford, but in competitors, cutting prices at this point, being willing to tolerate a higher benefit ratio than they might have a year or two ago?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I don't want to speculate. I don't want to say I really don't know, honestly, Josh. So you'll have to ask them that. I know what we're trying to do every day. Again, we want to be thoughtful. We want to compete. We want to maintain our margins. And I've said this before, you of all people know it and get it. I mean we're making three to five year rate guarantees depending on product line, and we can't go upside down with those types of guarantees out there. So we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined and try to do the best we can, but there are certain lines that we're just not going to cross. And so all I could say is, yes, we want to be relevant. We are relevant in the marketplace. There isn't a national account opportunity that doesn't come our way, and we're going to compete thoughtfully, but we're also willing just to put the pencil down and say that's enough.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

Alex, let me just give you a data point or two and then ask MO to add his color. Our total property capabilities spread across all our businesses, ex-Global Re, pricing actually accelerated 60 basis points during the quarter from 12.2 to 12.8. And I would say the two largest segments from a premium volume sort of led the way. Spectrum pricing is up 60 basis points also to 17.6, and our general industry property capabilities is up another 60 basis points to 8.5%. So again, feel really good as far as our sweet spot of being in that SME space and pricing remaining firm and actually expanding a little bit. That's not true in some of the larger, large property or E&S. MO, but what would you just add to your color?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo. And I think we're watching the reaction to the storms and trying to understand how that impacts the marketplace and certainly the reinsurance renewals. But generally, it's a favorable market that we would look to take advantage of.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. That's helpful. And maybe if I could sneak one last one in. Just when I think through the A&E reserve review in 4Q? I know you're probably not ready to give like a number or something like that. But could you help us think through like some of the underlying trends you see with those claims and so forth. They could help us at least directionally understand which way things are going there?\n\nChris Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI'll let Beth add her color. But Alex, we need to finish the review the study. I mean, we'll announce it, obviously, with fourth quarter, but there's nothing to speculate right now because we haven't completed our work.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I would agree with what Chris is saying.

Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before beginning, I want to take a moment to address the recent wildfires that have devastated the Los Angeles community. Our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy. Our team on the ground is working tirelessly to help our customers rebuild and recover, and I thank them for their dedication. After Beth and I summarize our outstanding fourth quarter and full-year results, we will then be joined by our business leaders for a Q&A session, including Mo Tooker, who was appointed President, effective tomorrow, February 1. Mo will lead all our P&C businesses and will be responsible for stewarding several enterprise-wide initiatives. Mo is an exceptional leader with a strong reputation for strategic growth, customer-focused solutions, underwriting discipline and building a cohesive culture. He is ideally suited to step into the President role, as we advance our growth and innovation strategy aimed at addressing our customers\u2019 changing needs. So let\u2019s get started. Our fourth quarter results capped off another outstanding year of financial performance and strategic achievements. These results highlight the strength of our franchise, particularly our exceptional underwriting execution, extensive distribution relationships and an unparalleled customer experience. I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to our dedicated employees. Your unwavering commitment and hard work are the driving force behind our success. Reflecting on some key achievements from 2024 for both the quarter and the year. Topline growth in commercial lines was 6% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.1%. For the year, growth was 9% and the underlying combined ratio of 87.9 was consistent with prior year. Personal Lines achieved 9.3 points of underlying combined ratio improvement in the quarter, including over 10 points in auto. For the year, Personal Lines delivered an underwriting gain, including an auto underlying loss ratio that was one point better than our expectations. We continue to achieve strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter, including notable double-digit increases in commercial and personal auto, commercial property, homeowners and general liability. Group Benefits delivered an impressive core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter and 8.2% for the year, led by strong life and disability results. And, our investment portfolio continues to generate solid performance. All these items contributed to an outstanding core earnings ROE of 16.7% for the year. Let me dive deeper into the performance of each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business achieved significant topline growth, while maintaining highly profitable underlying margins. Written premium growth was driven by strong pricing increases across most lines, double-digit new business growth in our SME focused business and exposure growth that continues to benefit from a resilient economy. As expected, underlying margins for the year were consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting, while sustaining industry-leading performance. Favorable underwriting results in property along with strong renewal written pricing execution across all lines offset industry-wide elevated liability severity. Beth, will provide specifics around prior year development in her comments, but I wanted to take a moment to address our general liability reserves. Based on our fourth quarter review, we have strengthened our general liability reserves by $130 million before tax. We believe that we have addressed the most recent trends and have adjusted our ultimate losses accordingly, reflecting the potential for increasing settlement costs due to a higher percentage of attorney representation across all claim sizes and the rise in average settlement rates. Moving into each of our Commercial Lines businesses. Small commercial remains the cornerstone of growth and profitability for The Hartford, setting an industry standard that is difficult to replicate in the market. I\u2019m very pleased to share that for the 6th consecutive year, Keynova Group has ranked The Hartford as the number one Small Commercial carrier in overall digital capabilities and important competitive advantage in this market. Our top ranking reflects our commitment to providing exceptional functionality, ease of use and unparalleled support and access to our agents and customers. Our financial performance reflects this top ranking, where we achieved a record breaking written premium of $5.5 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion of new business, while extending a decade long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios. With another year of exceptional results and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our Small Commercial business. Our Middle & Large Commercial organization continues to demonstrate strong growth and underlying profitability. We are capitalizing on elevated submission flow, driven in part by our strategic investments to expand product capabilities and enhance the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Our investments in Middle & Large Commercial position us well to drive additional topline growth and deliver exceptional results. While fourth quarter new business was slower than previous quarters, full-year performance included strong topline growth and an underlying margin that remained below 90. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and a 16% increase in Middle Market new business with robust growth across nearly all product lines, led by construction and marine.

In 2025, we expect to sustain our track record of delivering meaningful growth with underwriting discipline. Global Specialty had an exceptional year, maintaining excellent underlying margin performance in the low to mid-80s for the past three years. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove strong gross written premium growth and record new business. This expansion was fueled by significant contributions from Global Re and our wholesale business. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across Global Specialty with execution that has never been stronger. The transformational work we have done over the last five years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market-leading competitive advantage, driven by technology, data science and an experienced workforce. Whether in standard lines or E&S lines, we are gaining market share due to our unique underwriting capabilities and strong distribution relationships. Across Commercial Lines, our continued emphasis on property expansion generated 16% premium growth this year. We achieved our full-year goal ending the year with $3 billion in written premium and plan to continue building on this success in 2025. We remain confident that the market conditions support earning strong risk adjusted returns through disciplined underwriting, while maintaining a stable approach to catastrophe risk management. Despite industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses, we are proud that our full-year cat ratio remained flat with 2023 even with our significant property portfolio expansion. Moving to pricing. In Commercial Lines, renewal written pricing in the quarter excluding workers\u2019 compensation of 9.7% was up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. All in, ex-comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers\u2019 compensation pricing was slightly down sequentially. As we look to 2025 pricing, we are focused on keeping pace with loss cost trends. Across Commercial Lines, with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to grow market share at highly attractive margins. Turning to Personal Lines. 2024 was a transformative year, positioning us well for the future. We have positioned the business with new products and capabilities, revamped our operating routine and equipped ourselves with data and technology resources. We have faced business and environmental challenges with unparalleled determination and I want to recognize the team\u2019s hard work and commitment to our vision and strategy. For 2024 in auto, we achieved significant rate increases across the book, driving an overall auto underlying loss ratio improvement of 7.3 points over a point better than the high-end of our expectations. As a result of the significant written pricing actions that we\u2019ll earn into the book, combined with moderating severity trends, we expect continued underlying combined ratio improvement to reach the mid-90s during 2025. Our homeowners business had an exceptional year highlighted by an impressive underlying combined ratio for the quarter, the best we\u2019ve seen in over a decade and a slightly improved cat ratio in a year of elevated industry catastrophe losses. Pricing remained strong all year, outpacing underlying loss cost trends. Substantial investments have significantly improved price to risk matching and enhanced underwriting capabilities that are benefiting the homeowners book more broadly. With our rates in insurance to value keeping pace with loss trend, we are confident about our strong position in the market. Turning to Group Benefits. Our strong core earnings margin in 2024 demonstrates focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. Group life mortality trends were favorable, though they are expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels. The full-year disability loss ratio of 68%, primarily reflects favorable long-term disability trends, offset by pressure in paid family and medical leave products. These leave products are highly utilized and valued by employees and we are implementing the necessary rate and underwriting actions to improve the margins. Overall, the benefit landscape is evolving with increased awareness of features and benefits, which is positively impacting our supplemental products, such as critical illness, hospital indemnity and accident. We continue to expect the Group Benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear roadmap that I am confident will only strengthen our market leadership position. Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales during 2025 and are off to a solid start. Core earnings margins in recent years have exceeded our long-term targets. However, we continue to expect a core earnings margin of 6% to 7% in this business with disability incidence trends returning to historic levels. Moving to investments, the portfolio continues to support The Hartford\u2019s financial and strategic goals, performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. In closing, excellent fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning us to sustain consistent and superior results in 2025. I remain incredibly optimistic about our future, because 2024 financial results have showcased the effectiveness of our strategy and the value in our ongoing investments. Commercial Lines continues to maintain excellent underlying margins, while delivering robust topline growth. Group Benefits core earnings margin remains outstanding. We have achieved key milestones in our Personal Lines journey and plan to return auto to targeted profitability by mid-2025. Investment income remained strong, supported by attractive yields and a diversified durable portfolio of assets and share repurchases and dividends remain our primary capital management tool. As our businesses continue to generate excess capital, we will proactively manage capital resources to further drive shareholder value. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $865 million or $2.94 per diluted share with a full-year core earnings ROE of 16.7%. Commercial Lines had a strong quarter with core earnings of $665 million written premium growth of 6% and an underlying combined ratio of 87.1. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 9%, including 22% new business growth and an underlying combined ratio of 86.7%. This is the 18th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio below 90%. Middle & Large Commercial had another quarter of strong profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2, slightly improved from the prior year and written premium growth of 5%, reflecting lower new business as we remain disciplined, particularly with elevated general liability severity loss trends. Global Specialty\u2019s fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an excellent 83.6 with record earned premium of $865 million. Written premium growth of 3% in the quarter reflects lower new business in primary and excess casualty and from our Global Reinsurance business, which declined 14% primarily due to lower premium in Latin America.

      "raw_bytes": " 3% in the quarter reflects lower new business in primary and excess casualty and from our Global Reinsurance business, which declined 14% primarily due to lower premium in Latin America. Global Specialty written premium, excluding Global Re, was up 6%. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter increased to $155 million including the first underwriting gain in two years with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, driven by a 17.3 point improvement in the loss ratio over the prior year. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 103 improved 10.5 points from the 2023 period, and Homeowners produced an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 61.7. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 12% in the fourth quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.1% and earned pricing increases of 21.9%. In Homeowners, written pricing increases were 13.9% and 14.9% on an earned basis. Additionally, new business growth was robust in both Homeowners and Auto, with Homeowners more than doubling to $59 million and Auto increasing by 18% to $77 million. The Personal Line\u2019s fourth quarter expense ratio of 26.5 increased from the prior year by 1.9 points, primarily driven by higher direct marketing costs, higher staffing costs and higher commissions, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium. Total P&C net unfavorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $97 million before tax, primarily driven by $141 million of Asbestos & Environmental Development. Excluding the A&E development, core prior accident year net development was favorable by $44 million due to reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation, catastrophes, bond, professional liability and personal auto, partially offset by increases in general liability and commercial auto. As Chris mentioned, we strengthened our general liability reserve this quarter by $130 million before tax. This included strengthening to the 2015 to 2018 accident years driven by higher than expected construction defect claim activity in those years. In addition, across our general liability lines, we strengthened the incurred but not reported reserves for more recent accident years as we observed an increase in severity on reported claims above our expectations and anticipate a higher claim severity trend on unreported claims as the industry continues to face increasing settlement costs with rising attorney representation rates and higher average settlement rates. We completed our A&E reserve study in the quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $203 million comprised of $167 million for Asbestos and $36 million for Environmental. As I mentioned, $141 million impacted core earnings and $62 million was recorded as a deferred gain, exhausting the ADC cover we have for A&E. As a reminder, we have recorded a total of $850 million before tax as a deferred gain within other liabilities for A&E as of December 31. For our Navigators ADC, in 2024, we have amortized $145 million of the total $209 million deferred gain. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect the remaining balance of $64 million to be amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings. With respect to cats, P&C current accident year catastrophes in the fourth quarter were $80 million before tax, which was essentially flat to the prior year and included $68 million from Hurricane Milton as well as net reductions for cats incurred earlier in the year of $18 million. For the year, cats totaled $768 million. We continue to actively manage our cat exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk areas. Additionally, we have a robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. In terms of our catastrophe reinsurance program renewal on January 1, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our programs. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed an approximate 10% decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information compares favorably with the overall market and speaks to the quality of our underwriting, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience. Additionally, we continue to strategically leverage the combination of traditional reinsurance capacity with the sponsorship of our catastrophe bonds, Foundation Re, to ensure robust and diversified protection for our portfolio. As of January 1, after the reset of our catastrophe bond, our occurrence program provides protection from peak peril up to a gross loss event of $1.5 billion. The majority of that protection is secured on a multi-year basis. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and at a favorable decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis. The continuing strength and diversification of our property, occurrence, and aggregate protections aligns with and supports our strategic growth in property writings. Although it is too early to estimate the potential losses from the current California wildfires, we are closely monitoring the situation in areas where we have insured properties and businesses at risk. Our occurrence reinsurance program includes coverage for wildfires that attaches at $200 million and exhausts at $1.2 billion. Our reinsurance program does include provisions allowing a combination of events subject to hours and radius provisions. We have summarized the catastrophe reinsurance programs within the slide deck. Moving to Group Benefits, we achieved core earnings of $139 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter reflects improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 66.9 compared to 63.6 in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products and slightly higher LTD incidents in 2024 after two years of all-time historically low incidents, partially offset by favorable long-term disability claim recoveries. The group life loss ratio of 79.9 for the quarter improved 3.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. The Group Benefits expense ratio of 26.7 increased 2.5 points for the quarter, reflecting higher staffing costs and increased investments in technology. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $68 million combined with increased exposure on existing accounts and excellent persistency above 90%, resulted in a 1% growth in fully insured ongoing premiums. Turning to investments, our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. For the quarter, net investment income was $714 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, 10 basis points above third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher reinvestment rates and accretive trading activity earning into the portfolio. The fourth quarter reinvestment yield continued to exceed the sales and maturity yield. Looking forward to 2025, we expect net investment income, excluding LPs, to be higher, driven by an increased level of invested assets resulting from continued growth and anticipate yields to be marginally higher than 2024. As expected, our fourth quarter annualized LP returns of 6.4% before tax were higher than previous quarters. We continue to anticipate LP returns to improve in 2025, exceeding 2024 on a full-year basis. Turning to capital, as of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion. For 2025, we expect net dividends from the operating company of approximately $2.5 billion a 9% increase over 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at tha"

Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nHey, good morning. First question, and hate to even bring this one up because the quarter was so darn excellent, but the prior year development of general liability a $130 million, could you break out that mix between the \u201815 and \u201818, underwriting year construction defect policies versus the, IBNR on the more recent accident years? What was the mix there? And then with that, really curious about how confident going forward you won\u2019t likely need to take other GL charges because, I think with construction defect policies, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the pricing now is much higher for labor and material loads, as that\u2019s probably the reason for 2015 to 2018 charges. So, I\u2019m kind of curious on, construction defect in particular, but I think those are much tighter policies today.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nAndrew, thank you for joining us for the question. Let me give you some context and then I\u2019ll ask Beth to add her commentary on the splits by year. So, you\u2019re right, we made a move on our reserves and added $130 million in PYD across number of accident years in Product Lines. And, we also did a little move in commercial auto. So, I think what I really want you to know and you said it, with this move and Beth will explain more on some of the approach changes that we made this quarter, I feel highly confident that we put a good, if not all, a good chunk of this behind us. And, we\u2019ve been working hard at getting our reserves right every quarter, but more importantly pricing our products for the new trend to make sure that we\u2019re improving our economics into the extent possible. So, on the PYD side, I\u2019m highly, highly confident. I think the implication though there is, we also then needed to take a move on our 2024 accident year where we added about one point on a year-to-date basis to our expectations for GL. So, we needed to then true-up 2024. And then as we looked at 2025, I could share with you that we have these higher loss cost trends in our assumptions. The team, our underwriters are already reacting with increased pricing, really effective one-one and will continue throughout the rest of the year. So comprehensively, I feel like we got our arms around it and are hitting the ground running as hard as we can in 2025. And, if I put that all in context for you Andrew, of all people gets it is, I do believe we can generate margins that are consistent with 2024. And, that\u2019s ultimately the proof of all our actions, all our strategies, all our ability to execute at a high-level. And, I think that\u2019s an important data point for you and others to hear. So, I\u2019ll ask Beth to do the splits and any other commentary she\u2019d like to make.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Thank you, Chris. So, as it relates to the liability reserve increases between sort of the older accident years, the \u201815 to \u201818 and then more recent years, I\u2019d say the split is roughly half-and-half. And Andrew, I would agree with your characterization on the older years that that really is related to sort of increased costs that have happened. Think of sort of post-COVID and the inflation that we\u2019ve seen. That really is related to legacy book. And, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve made adjustments to those reserves. That\u2019s a book that we\u2019ve done significant re underwriting on and really feel that\u2019s contained in those years. The more recent years that activity I would characterize is more related to social inflation. And, as it relates to how we approach the reserve increases this year, this quarter, I would say we did a little different approach. In the previous quarters when we had PYD in the general liability lines, we were reacting to the elevated activity we were seeing. We were adjusting that accordingly. And, if we had followed that same approach this quarter, I think our reserve strengthening would have been more consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. But given that it was another quarter of this elevated activity, this quarter not only did we react to the observed activity, we also increased our severity assumptions going forward for unsettled and unreported reserves resulting in a larger increase to IBNR. And as Chris said, we also incorporated these estimates into our 2024 accident year. So, when we step back, when we look at the actions that we took for prior years, the actions that we\u2019ve taken in the current year, we think this positions us very well going into 2025 both in terms of the overall adequacy of our GL reserves. And equally important and Chris comments on this, but I want to reemphasize it, these trends are incorporated into our pricing models going forward and that\u2019s what our business leaders are executing on with the goal of getting pricing increases above these loss trends.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nVery helpful. And, just quickly on net written premium in commercial. Small Commercial was a really strong 9%, Mid Large was 5%. And I think last year, there was kind of a disconnect on, or there was some underperformance of some of your competitors and you were able to capitalize. So, I want to understand, do you still have that momentum in Small Commercial in that upper-single-digits? And then, with Mid to Large at 5%, I think in the past, Mo has talked about the lower-end of Mid being pretty robust, just like Small Commercial. So, how sustainable is the mid-single-digit in Mid, Mid Large net written premium growth?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nAndrew, I\u2019ll start and then ask Mo to comment. So, I think on an overall basis, if you look at the components of commercial, particularly on a year-to-date basis, we feel really good about the growth, the execution, how we\u2019re capturing additional market share. So, nothing philosophically is going to change in our approach other than we just need to continue to be disciplined from an underwriting side. And yes, from quarter-to-quarter you could have some variations, it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, others might lean in a little bit more to us. But, I really would want you to know. Yes, we want to grow and capture more market share and serve more clients and serve more of our agency needs, but only in our terms and conditions and with the proper underwriting and proper pricing. And, I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s reflected in this quarter. But, Mo, what would you add?\n\nMorris Tooker - Head of Commercial Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. Maybe I\u2019ll take it a little bit deeper, Andrew. I would say that the Small Commercial just had a terrific year, I think 9% overall, new and renewal strong, the flows continue to be really good. And, this is especially in the face of some disruption around us over the past couple of years, and I think the team has really been measured in the way they\u2019ve grown so that we can be consistently growing going forward. So, I think really what you saw in the quarter was our strategic advantage is showing through. That\u2019s our investments in technology, helping the customer and the agent get things into the system easier to data advantage. And then all on top of that for small, I think we just had a really good year on the E&S binding front and they will continue to push into the E&S space, because we think we can bring our same strategic abilities into that space. Middle & Large Commercial is a little bit of a different story. We\u2019re really happy there too with the 9% for the year, but the market is competitive and the team there has really tried to stay disciplined. And, what we saw in the quarter was a little bit more of a competitive market, especially in the workers\u2019 comp, the GL and "

I think it\u2019s an out of pattern quarter. We still see submission flow really good into the Middle & Large Commercial space, especially in the lower-end to your point. The market is broadly supported from a pricing perspective. And again, the investments that we\u2019re making in that space, we\u2019re trying to take all that advantage we have in Small into the Middle space. And we think that just allows us to gain market share in the Middle Market space over time. So again, I think two different stories, but confident about our ability to grow it and grow market share over time.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):"

First one to, Beth, I was trying to get a baseline on kind of what the underlying loss ratio looks like in Commercial Lines with some of the antidotes you were talking about. So, what was the kind of favorable non-cat kind of property loss? And then, any current year development when you increase at IBNR anything from 2024 that may have impacted it?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nBrian, if I understand your question and Beth can add her commentary. I think what I said in my commentary was for the GL line, it was a one point true-up on a year-to-date basis for the elevated combined ratio given some of the things we just talked about from PYD, it\u2019s probably 2.5 points in the quarter on a comparable basis year-over-year. And then, you\u2019re also asking about property, I think I heard.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nYes, yes. I think you mentioned that non-cat weather was a little bit favorable this quarter.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nRight. So, I know you\u2019re jumping and trying to get numbers from me. So I would say, yes, I would say on a year-to-date basis compared to prior year, our non-cat property experience is about 0.9 point better than we than prior year. And from an expectation side, it\u2019s probably 1.5 points, a little better than our expectation. But, Beth?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nNo, I would agree with that. And as you know, a non-cat property can obviously bounce around quarter-to-quarter. But, looking at the numbers that Chris just quoted relative to the prior year, I\u2019d also say that we did take underwriting actions in \u201823 on our property book. So, some of that we would expect would continue to benefit.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. That\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m just wondering, is it possible to give us a little more color on perhaps exposure to the LA wildfires here kind of what your share in the area is? Do you have commercial exposure with your Small Commercial business? Do you think you\u2019re going to hit your cat reinsurance programs here?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I\u2019m going to, Beth and I tag team and I would say, I think you\u2019re very observant that this is for us going to be both a Commercial Lines event and a Personal Lines event. If I look at our Personal Lines market share for home and auto and because obviously some cars will also be damaged, we\u2019re less than 1%. We\u2019ve managed California very tightly, I would say over the last seven or eight years Beth with concentrations of risk that we had in certain zones that we needed to remediate. So, Personal Lines obviously what will have some losses. And then, our bigger market share is in our Middle Market book and our BOP product, Small Commercial. So, we do have larger market share there. We\u2019ll have to see how things develop. And, we just been recently been able to get on-site and start to do more inspections. We have our reinsurance business that will have a little bit exposure and then we\u2019ll have to see what the FAIR plan does with any assessment. So, instead of just putting numbers out, we really wanted to just be more deliberate and thoughtful and when we\u2019re ready, Brian we\u2019ll share with you what we believe and see. So Beth, what would you add?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. So again, maybe to put it in context as you asked to our reinsurance program. As we sit here today and we look at our exposures, as I said in my prepared remarks, our first part of our per occurrence coverage starts at losses once they\u2019ve reached $200 million. So that first layer, we have $150 million of protection in excess $200 million and we retain 60% of that, 40% of that is reinsured and very likely that we will be in that layer. The next layer then comes in at $350 million. That layer again provides $150 million excess of $350 million. We retain 25%. We reinsure 75%. Sitting here today, it\u2019s not entirely clear that we\u2019ll be at that level. We could very well be below that. Again, all of that would exclude Global Re. Global Re has its own retrocession program. That program attaches when U.S. property losses hit $60 million and right now we\u2019d expect to be below that. So, hopefully that gives you some context of just how we\u2019re framing it. And, the last thing I\u2019ll just remind you of is that, as it relates to wildfire losses, up to losses of $350 million excluding Global Re, those losses would count towards our aggregate treaty, which again attaches similar to last year at $750 million.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

I was hoping to get a sense how much of that was driven by paid family and medical leave versus higher LTD incidents?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nElyse, thanks for joining us. I would say when we characterize our LTD excuse me, our disability book, it includes both the LTD portion, the STD portion and then obviously some of our new paid medical and family leave products. So, on a call it year-over-year basis, I would say that the PFML incident trends that are elevated is creating three points of that difference. Our long-term disability incidences, one point and then the offset to that is our recoveries or terminations are probably one point better. So, that\u2019s the step between years I would have you to think about.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then, my second question is on the kind of the high-level view you provided on Commercial Lines for 2025. Chris, I think in response to an earlier question, you said kind of like flat, underlying combined ratio and you pointed to that contemplating continued higher GL picks. But, then you guys did say that there was 1.5 points of favorable non-cat in \u201824. So, you assuming that, that normalizes like and reverses in your outlook for flat margins in 2025? And is there anything else we need to think about kind of when thinking about commercial margins in 2025?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I would say, again, you heard it right. I think we\u2019re ending the year at 87.9 on an underlying combined ratio in Commercial Lines. And I think we can produce a consistent result in 2025. That\u2019s what I want you to hear. And, if you want to do all the pluses and minuses by product line and things like that, I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m going to tell you that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to deliver in totality with a diversified product line point of view, executing strongly, particularly in the general liability lines. And, if there\u2019s returns to normal or if there\u2019s additional benefits that we\u2019re able to get that will all be part of the results that we\u2019ll communicate quarterly to you on it, but I\u2019m not going to get into a reconciliation by product line.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nGot it.

So, if we think about the GL reserve charge this quarter and the two smaller ones in prior quarters, can you maybe help us get a sense of how much of loss picks would have gone up from the initial loss pick assumptions for the year, like just for the entire book? Yes, that will be the first question.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I think Bob, thanks for the question. It\u2019s actually a good one. All I\u2019m going to ask you to do is wait until we file the 10-Ks and Schedule P\u2019s and you\u2019ll see it there, Beth, you want to add any color right now. But I would say that the overall trends, Bob, that we\u2019ve talked about as far as attorney rep rate, slip and falls in certain areas, just the dollar levels of to settle some of these cases, the time limit demands that the Planet Bar uses to sort of jam us. I mean, that is generally consistent and nothing\u2019s changing. And as Beth said, what we did take is just a more holistic approach to estimating that these trends most likely will continue and that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in the charge. But, I\u2019d ask you just to wait for the K and the Schedule P\u2019s to be filed and you could see those trends.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. Got it. My follow-up is Group Benefits. One thing you previously said was moderating incidents and fast claims recovery really drove a lot of the outperformance in the prior quarters, especially in long-term disability. Now, it does look like it\u2019s changing this quarter to be a more normalized trend. Is there like how should we think about what is a normal run rate for that long-term disability business in terms of incidence and claims recovery knowing that the last two years was abnormally low?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. I\u2019ll do my best to try to explain that to you. And then, I\u2019m going to ask Mike Fish to add his commentary. I would first start with saying that, remember, lot of our LTD, our clients and policies have 90 day or even 180 day elimination periods. So, really the last two quarters of the year, we\u2019re not out of elimination periods, and we\u2019re still sort of in pick. And, when we look at sort of trends in totality, those were some of the judgments we always make. And from quarter-to-quarter, we might make judgments that are different on what\u2019s emerging versus what\u2019s still in pick. So, I would say though that overall, over the last two years, our disability incidence trends have been like at all-time lows and rock bottoms. And, what we\u2019re beginning to reflect now is just a, I\u2019ll call it a more normalized return to mean assumption, so that we don\u2019t get caught short in any of our reserving positions here. So, those are the two components I would share with you and I\u2019ll ask Mike to add any of his color.\n\nMike Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nChris, I think you captured that well. The only couple of items that I would add to your point on what we saw with historically low incidence levels and that was early back in 2022 and 2023 accident years. And, when we look at that and we look at where we\u2019re running more recently, I would say our recent experience you\u2019re seeing here in the quarter would correlate back to about a five year average of incidence historical sort of average. And, that\u2019s about where we set our pricing. So as you know, we\u2019ve got rate guarantees generally two, three or maybe beyond three years. So, we\u2019re looking at a longer-term average around both incidence and recovery. So again, I just leave you with incidence rates more recently trending back to a historical five year average. And then, our recovery experience has been very favorable. Our team does an outstanding job on the claim side and we expect to see strong performance moving forward.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):"

I think that you\u2019ve gotten yourself comfortable that you\u2019ve put this issue to bed. Generally, putting something to bed means that you\u2019ve put a layer of caution on top of something beyond your best actuarial estimate of where it is, so you don\u2019t have to revisit that again. But, I know that you\u2019re always trying to get to the best number. In the grand scheme of things, $130 million is not a lot of reserves given the size of your general liability book. Have you done something differently other than given the data you have gone to the most precise number you can? Or have you put a layer of caution on top of the number?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nWell, Josh, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call it caution. But as I said in my response to the first question, we did evaluate the reserves a little differently this quarter. And, that\u2019s why the reserve charge was higher than what you\u2019ve seen in previous quarters. So, I\u2019ll leave you with that. That was how we have evaluated sort of the current trend and an expectation that that trend will continue. We have included that in our estimate for prior accident years. We\u2019ve built that into our call for the \u201824 accident year. And as I said, it\u2019s built into our pricing models, going forward.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay. And then, on the Personal Lines business, I see you\u2019re growing in homeowners, still leading from auto. To the extent that the product design, is it generally designed to be sold as a home auto bundle? And, is there any risk of adverse selection selling monoline homeowners?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThank you, Josh for seeing the improvement that Melinda and the team have made there. So, I think we\u2019re in a good position. I\u2019ll look to Melinda add her color, but I think right now we probably bundle 75% of our homeowners business with auto. We\u2019re not a big monoline homeowners player. We do it on occasion, particularly as our agency channel is being revived a little bit with an older product. So, that\u2019s what I would say. But Melinda what would you add?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I think we\u2019re really proud of the performance of our home business as evidenced by the results this quarter and on a full-year basis. And, if you look at our home business over a long period of time, we\u2019ve generated combined ratios in the low-90s which really compares favorably to the industry. So, as we think about the performance, the investments we\u2019ve made and the products and capabilities, we believe we can grow the business with our auto and where we write at monoline do so in a way that is judicious and thoughtful.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nAnd Josh, I would just add one last point. I think the team led by our risk management team, our underwriters have really taken to heart modeling sort of on a by payroll basis. All the things that could go wrong from a weather, from an earthquake, from a wildfires as we\u2019re seeing. So, I really have the utmost confidence in the improvements we\u2019ve made one in our modeling, our risk selection, matching price and risk and I\u2019d like the opportunity to continue to grow thoughtfully in the homeowners market because again it\u2019s a needed product. There\u2019s a lot of disruption in those marketplaces, but we\u2019re going to be continue to be cautious and thoughtful, but I think we got a pretty good track record.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nThanks. I know you\u2019ve been putting in a lot of work. Appreciate it."

I had a follow-up question on the general liability reserves and I appreciate it sounds like you guys took a more proactive approach on the reserves this quarter. I guess, I\u2019m wondering now after the changes you\u2019ve made, what sort of severity assumption you guys are embedding in the reserves on the more recent years? And, what you guys are thinking going forward in 2025?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, David, it\u2019s Chris. I would say in aggregate when you think about sort of liability lines, I would say we\u2019re in low-double-digit range currently. Some of the primary lines of business might be a little lower in our general industries and then the umbrella and the excess might be a little higher sort of even in the 15%, 16% range. But, I would say for the recent year, we\u2019re probably exiting low-double-digits in aggregate, and that\u2019s what we need to react to from a pricing side. That\u2019s already baked into all our pricing models that our underwriters are executing to beginning here in January. And, that\u2019s the mission for next year, particularly in any liability line, including commercial auto. We got to stay up with these elevated loss cost trends. And, I know the team knows how to do that very, very well in an empathetic way, while still taking care of customers and agents. But, we got to protect our margins.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Understood. And then, just another question and I guess this one\u2019s a bigger picture question just in terms of the reserving process. Could you guys remind me when you first started recognizing this impact of hiring attorney rep? And I guess, have you have you guys changed your approach, to just detecting these trends over the last year or so? I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s been anything that that you guys have done that might be picking up on it a little bit more than in the past.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything dramatic. I really thought the question was just meant to torture us David. But, I think our listening post what we\u2019re doing with our claim lawyers, our claim teams in totality, there\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t think we missed per se. I just think it\u2019s a magnitude of sort of some of the strategies that the plant at bars uses particularly with time, bar demands. And again, that\u2019s you get into, if you get that wrong, I mean the potential magnitude is really greater on a claims side. We saw much more, I\u2019ll call it just basic slip and fall activity as we talked about in the past. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we\u2019re missing. If anything, maybe we were just a little too optimistic on how severe these trends were going to be and how long they were going to continue. But, that\u2019s what I would say. Beth?\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes. The only thing I would add to that, David, is that last quarter we talked about the fact that we saw activity that was above our expectations. So, the notion around increased attorney rep to increase severity, and some of that was built into our assumptions. It\u2019s just last quarter when we, as Chris pointed out, when we saw actual activity coming in, time limit demand and attorney rep rates changing from what our expectation was, that\u2019s when we made some of those adjustments. And, I think we commented on this last quarter that when we look overall at our general liability business, we\u2019ve definitely seen a decrease in frequency over the last several years. So, that points to a lot of very favorable underwriting actions that we\u2019ve taken. What we were seeing though is that when we broke out the categories of claims into no attorney rep, attorney rep and litigated, all three of those buckets from a frequency perspective were coming down. It\u2019s just that the frequency decrease was higher in the non-attorney, non-litigated bucket than some of the other buckets. And that, again, these claims have seasoned, became more evident in the last quarter or so.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

      "raw_bytes": "Gregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGood morning, everyone. Congratulations on your promotion, Mo. In your comments, you spoke about the increase in the expense ratio in Personal Lines. I was wondering if you could unpack what\u2019s going on there a little bit in more detail. Just it\u2019s kind of counterintuitive given the amount of premium and rate increases are flowing through and some of the new business restrictions that have been put in place prior to see your expense ratio going up if that makes sense?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nI think Greg, I\u2019ll ask Melinda to add her color. It could be a little bit of mix, right, as we mix in a little bit more agency. And, we\u2019re still investing in the platform somewhat. We\u2019re at the tail end of the direct response rollout of prevail. So, that\u2019s in 45, 50 states. And, we are contemplating a broader agency strategy that we\u2019re spending some money on. Melinda, would you add anything else?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, just maybe, sorry, I just want to revisit some of Beth\u2019s comments because she alluded to the themes earlier. In the quarter we were up about two points. That was largely driven by marketing and by higher commissions and the premium growth that we are driving certainly over time and the PIP growth that we are seeing in home that\u2019s all come with investment and new business growth. And so, marketing spend and commissions are the primary driver in the quarter.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGot it. And, I guess a reserve question, but in an entirely different subject area. Everyone seems to be still taking A&E reserves and this is like this number goes away. Do you have some perspective like on outstanding claim counts as you would think that this would start to subside, it just doesn\u2019t for the industry and for you guys?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nThat\u2019s a hell of a last question, Greg of the day. So, I would share with you just a high-level observation and Beth can add hers is. I think frequency of claims is coming down, particularly in the MISO area. But, severity is going up as again the plaintiffs is trying to extract the same amount of economics or greater economics per claim than sort of the older days. So, yes, I\u2019m hopeful that at least the frequency trends could continue and we\u2019ll try to manage the severity trends as best way we can. And yes, that\u2019s why we did the A&E cover years ago when we did. Obviously, we fully utilized it, which turned out to be a good trade for our shareholders. And, we\u2019ll just manage it the best we can going forward, but it\u2019s a continuing issue for sure.\n\nBeth Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group):\nYes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d add too much to that. I mean, obviously, on the frequency piece, some of it is a little bit of just what our expectations were. So, you might see a little bit of a decrease. We would have expected maybe more. And so, some of that impacts our study each year, kind of where our particular insureds and the insurance that we provide for particular insureds, where that shows up sort of as we do the ground up study by insured and that can change year-to-year. We had a little bit more activity that we saw on accounts where we just had a little bit more exposure than some of the others. And then on Environmental there, we had a little bit of just increase in remediation costs, one coming from a coal ash claim and things like that. So similar themes, I would say, to what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all earnings-related materials on our website. Before we begin, please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements which are not guarantees of future performance and may differ materially from actual results. We do not assume any obligation to update these statements. Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties detailed in our recent SEC filings, news release, and financial supplement, which are available on the Investor Relations section of thehardware.com. Our commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, with explanations and GAAP reconciliations available in our recent SEC filings, news release, and financial supplement. And now I'd like to introduce our speakers. Christopher J. Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, we will take your questions assisted by several members of our management team. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is off to a strong start in Q1 2025, sustaining the momentum we have built over the past few years. Before I get into the details, let me take a moment to comment upon the macroeconomic environment. We are operating in dynamic times. However, as an underwriting-centric organization specializing in managing risk, we are well equipped to navigate this evolving environment. Our teams are closely monitoring trends and are already taking action to address the impacts of this complex and dynamic policy landscape. With solid fundamentals, a durable investment portfolio, and a balance sheet that is stronger than ever, we remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering strong returns for our shareholders. Now let's transition to first-quarter results. As I mentioned, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. had a strong start to the year, even in the face of the most destructive wildfires in US history. Disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, and innovative customer-centric technology continue to drive our performance. Highlights from the first quarter include top-line growth in business insurance of 10% with a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.4. An underlying combined ratio of 89.7 in personal insurance representing a 6.4 improvement over the prior year, including over eight points in auto. A core earnings margin of 7.6% in employee benefits, which continued to outperform in a competitive environment. And continued solid performance in our investment portfolio. All these items contributed to a trailing twelve-month core earnings ROE of 16.2%. As I dive into the details, let me start with PNC current accident year catastrophe losses which totaled $467 million before tax, including $325 million related to the January California wildfires. Catastrophe risk management strategies and reinsurance structure effectively contained exposure, keeping it well within our market share. While we are pleased with the performance of our overall book of business and risk management program, the losses were significant to first-quarter results. In times like these, I'm especially proud of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s claim handlers, adjusters, and leaders. Excluding catastrophe losses, our businesses sustained strong performance in line with or exceeding expectations. Turning to business insurance, results were excellent driven by our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements. New business growth remains strong within small middle market where the environment continues to be conducive for growth. As the leading small business carrier, our digital capabilities offer exceptional functionality and ease of use, providing us with a significant competitive advantage in the market. We have successfully leveraged these strengths to enhance the middle market and global specialty businesses. We are going to market as one unified organization to serve the diverse needs of customers and partners with a consistent and top-tier experience. In small business, first-quarter financial performance was excellent with record-breaking quarterly written premium, and double-digit new business growth while extending a nineteen-quarter trend of sub-ninety underlying combined ratios. New business growth was driven in part by strong quote flow and modestly higher average premium, as well as a 29% increase in E and S binding premium, a business where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. In short, small business continues to deliver excellent results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities. We are on track to surpass $6 billion in annual written premium in 2025. Moving to middle and large, we are pleased with first-quarter performance including excellent top-line growth, paired with a strong underlying margin in line with our expectations. New business growth remained strong with contributions from multiple lines and market sectors. We continue to take advantage of healthy submissions driven in part by investments made to expand product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution across most lines including double-digit increases in liability and auto. Shifting to global specialty, results were outstanding, sustained underlying margins in the mid-80s and over $1 billion in quarterly written premium. This impressive top-line performance reflects our strong competitive position, diverse product offerings, and solid renewal written pricing including double-digit pricing in wholesale casualty. Our wholesale business saw an 11% increase in gross written premium with significant contributions from US inland marine, auto, and casualty lines, and the global reinsurance business also grew at a double-digit clip. With a diverse product set, in a generally healthy pricing environment, we remain excited about the growth prospects in global specialty. Across business insurance, combined emphasis on property expansion has resulted in written premium growth of approximately 15% this quarter. We are capitalizing on the favorable market conditions in the SME space with a disciplined approach and no change in our catastrophe risk appetite. As for pricing, business insurance, renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, of 9.9% increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. Our pricing execution remained strong including low double-digit increases in general liability and auto, with liability pricing continuing to rise. The team hit the ground running on one-one renewals exceeding liability pricing targets which are comfortably above loss cost trends. In business insurance property, pricing remains healthy in the low double digits driven by 18% pricing increases within our small business package product. In personal insurance, margins continue to improve achieving an underlying combined ratio in the 80s for the first time in three years. We expect target profitability in auto by mid-2025 consistent with our expectations. Having navigated a challenging loss cost environment, personal insurance is now focused on balancing profitability and a pivot to growth in a competitive environment. Our homeowners business had a strong underlying quarter highlighted by a mid-seventies underlying combined ratio. Renewal written pricing of 12.3% driven by net rate and insured value increases continues to support healthy margins while reinforcing our strong position in the market. Moving on to employe"

Moving on to employee benefits. Core earnings margin of 7.6% exceeded prior year by 1.5 points surpassing our long-term target of 6% to 7%. Group life and disability both delivered excellent results. The disability loss ratio reflected nearly 20 points of improvement in paid family and medical leave products and the life loss ratio continued to improve. Modest fully insured ongoing premium growth reflects the competitive environment and strong book persistency which is above 90%. Sales were largely in line with expectations for the quarter. Want to take a moment to highlight ongoing technology investments in employee benefits, focused on superior customer experience and enabling growth. In absence and disability, we recently launched our patented leave lens platform empowering employees to confidently plan for their leave of absence through a comprehensive view of their benefits, available time, and prospective pay while away from work. We also recently delivered a new absence dashboard tool which gives employers dynamic reporting capabilities regarding their employees' leaves of absence. These market differentiating tools in conjunction with recent investments in life claim digital intake provide a holistic suite of new digital capabilities for customers. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing data exchanges and integration connections with benefit administration and human resource platforms to drive future growth. We now have over 60 integrations with HR technology partners servicing over two-thirds of our book. And we continue to build our leadership position in this space. For example, we have deepened our partnership with Workday to co-design their new Workday wellness platform which will deliver faster integrations, comprehensive implementation support, and real-time data exchange. With these capabilities and continued investment in the benefits business, we expect to retain our number one disability position and our top five life position while delivering an outstanding user experience for customers and their employees. Moving to investments, the portfolio continues to support The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s financial strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details on the performance in the quarter. Alongside strong financial results, the first quarter also marked the launch of our new brand. As we further establish ourselves as an innovative and growth-oriented industry leader, our strategy is intentionally centered on customers and their evolving needs. The new brand celebrates The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s strengths built on centuries of trust from businesses, workers, and individuals we support every day. As CEO, I remain honored to lead a company with such a rich legacy and bright future driven by exceptional employees and their unwavering commitment to our customers. Looking ahead, we are expanding digital capabilities leveraging AI, enhancing our product offering, and entering new markets to better serve customers. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. as we continue delivering industry-leading financial performance. It is an exciting time at The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. for our employees, customers, distribution partners, and all stakeholders. Together, we will navigate this dynamic environment and seize the opportunities ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Costello - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $639 million or $2.2 per diluted share with a trailing twelve-month core earnings ROE of 16.2%. Although results were impacted by elevated catastrophe activity, including the January California wildfire event, underlying PNC results and employee benefits results were excellent. In business insurance, core earnings were $471 million with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 88.4. Small business continues to deliver industry-leading results with written premium growth of 9%, double-digit new business growth, and an underlying combined ratio of 89.4. Middle and large business had another quarter of solid profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 90.6 and written premium growth of 9% including record quarterly new business of $188 million. Global Specialty's first quarter was outstanding, with an underlying combined ratio of 84 and a record first-quarter written premium of $1 billion. Written premium growth of 11% in the quarter reflects strong growth across much of the book and solid renewal execution, including written pricing increases of 6.2%. In personal insurance, core earnings for the quarter were $6 million with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7 driven by an improvement of 8.1 points in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over the prior year. The first-quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 96.1% improved 8.3 points from the 2024 period, and homeowners produced a strong underlying combined ratio of 75.1. Written premium in personal insurance increased 8% in the first quarter in part driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 15.8% and earned pricing increases of 20%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 12.3% and 14.4% on an earned basis. Additionally, new business growth continues to be robust in both homeowners and auto. Homeowners policy count continued to grow while auto decreased as expected. Effective policy count retention for both homeowners and auto remained flat due to strong but moderating renewal written pricing increases. The personal insurance first-quarter expense ratio of 27 increased from the prior year by 1.7 points, primarily driven by higher direct marketing costs, and to a lesser extent, a higher commission ratio, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium. Respect to catastrophes, PNC current accident year losses were $467 million before tax or 11.1 combined ratio points including $325 million net of reinsurance, related to the January California wildfire event as well as tornado, wind, and hail events primarily in the Midwest and South regions in the month of March. We are pleased with our robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. As a reminder, the aggregate treaty provides $200 million of coverage when subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Total PNC net favorable prior year development within core earnings was $90 million before tax primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, homeowners, and personal auto. There were no increases in prior year reserves for general liability and commercial auto. The actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2024 positioned us well for 2025, both in terms of the overall adequacy of our general liability and commercial auto reserve and equally important, incorporating these trends into our pricing models. We recorded $32 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect the remaining balance of $32 million to be amortized in the second quarter. Moving to employee benefits, we achieved core earnings of $130 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 7.6% reflects excellent group life and disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 69 improved from 70.1 in the first quarter of 2024, driven by improvement in the paid family and medi"

The group disability loss ratio of 69 improved from 70.1 in the first quarter of 2024, driven by improvement in the paid family and medical leave product loss ratio and continued strong claim recovery. The improvement was partially offset by a slight increase in long-term disability incidents compared to the prior year. However, incidence rates remain favorable to long-term historical averages and to our expectations. The group life loss ratio of 79.9 for the quarter improved 2.7 points reflecting lower mortality. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $381 million combined with increased exposure on existing accounts and excellent persistency above 90% resulted in a 2% growth in fully insured ongoing premium. For the quarter, net investment income was $656 million. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.4% before tax, 10 basis points above the year-ago period, and 20 basis points below the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower equity dividends, lower returns on public equity-related fund investments, and a modestly lower yield on variable rate securities. Our first-quarter annualized LP return of 3.1% before tax was higher than the year-ago period although returns were lower than the fourth quarter including lower returns in our real estate portfolio and other funds. We continue to strategically manage the portfolio balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities and in the quarter reinvested at 70 basis points above the sales and maturity yield. Full-year 2025 net investment income excluding LPs is expected to be higher than in 2024 driven by invested asset growth. We expect the 2025 yield XLPs to be generally in line with the yield earned in 2024 as lower yields on variable rate securities are expected to offset increases from reinvesting at higher rates. Turning to capital management. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter-end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million and we expect to remain at that level of repurchase in the second quarter. As of March 31, we had $2.75 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong financial performance for the first quarter and believe we are well-positioned to continue to enhance value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Kate. Thank you, Beth. We will now take your questions. Operator, please repeat the instructions for asking a question."

And what we are feeling in the quarter, and we've talked about it in prior quarters, was pressure on the workers' compensation specifically. I'm really proud of how the teams navigated. They're just making choices on renewals, but overall, we just feel like this is a competitive market in middle and large. And also what you saw in the quarter was really nice growth overall with a 9% in middle and large. I think what you're feeling is we have the diversification that we've built over in the past decade in middle and large so that when retention is down in workers' comp and workers' comp is really competitive, we have the ability to grow in other areas and still maintain the top line that we're chasing.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nGood.

And so I'm just curious about how you're looking at your technology progress and, you know, help us on the outside sort of reconcile what, you know, what's legacy maintenance stuff versus new initiatives that are game-changing?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. Happy to, you know, try. I mean, that's probably like a four-hour discussion, Greg. But you know, what I would, you know, just share with you, and I think we've said it consistently before, is, you know, we've been on a journey over the last ten fifteen years of just making basic improvements into our core platforms. And our core platforms in all businesses. And those platforms would be defined as claim systems administrative systems, billing, and remittance, you know, type systems. And then, you know, recently, you know, we've launched a multiyear project, a seven-year project to take all our data and applications, you know, to the cloud. So I think personally, we have the best platform in all our businesses. For personal lines, we have a modern SaaS-based, you know, platform group benefits. We've modernized all our platforms there and taking that to the cloud and Guidewire continues to be our preferred vendor both for administration in commercial insurance as well as you know, claims. So and we spent a lot of money you know, doing that thoughtfully. But, you know, we knew we needed to do it to really have the flexibility in our products and to ultimately drive down our cost. I think what we've been doing of late and of latest, let's say, over more of the last, you know, five, six years is really organizing our data more effectively. We've had more consumer customer-centric digital capabilities. I mentioned all the things that we were doing in group benefits because sometimes there's a little bit of misinformation out there that I felt needed to be corrected. And so, yeah, again, we're investing in our customer experience. We've invested in core capabilities and benefits. And then you know, of late, you know, everyone's been talking about AI. And I'm not gonna talk about it in great detail, but we got three main areas we're focused on, claims, underwriting, and operations. And we will lead the AI implementation for the industry. And all I'd ask you to do is just stay tuned.\n\nGregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

First, Chris, Moe, could you talk a little bit about what tariffs could potentially mean for lost costs as you think about it in auto insurance and any area in commercial insurance you're thinking about? I'd be happy to try. Brian. You know, but as you know, I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks, a fairly, you know, dynamic environment and there's a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. So if you take that as sort of the foundation to my comments, you know, I think you know, what our views right now are, you know, that the tariffs probably will affect, you know, the price. Of automobiles, parts, building materials, supplies. And if you think about it, and others have commented upon it, that that should be a one-time event. Know, that sort of step change and then a normal trend would hopefully, you know, continue, you know, from there. I think in personal and commercial auto, I believe our loss picks for Q1 2025 were prudent. You know, which meant we have a level of, you know, conservatism in there. That will hopefully allow us the opportunity to minimize any tariff-related increases most likely in the second half of the year. As it relates to home and commercial property, all I would say is I think our reaction function there is tight and we can react timely. And, you know, obviously make any adjustments in our pricing, particularly in those, you know, products. I think, you know, equally in our personal auto liability, I think, you know, we've worked on our rate filings. Know how to file rates. But more importantly, you know, we've worked on our reaction time there to sort of have a faster cycle time. And I've we've talked about it in the past. I think about 45% of our states, you know, that we operate in require prior approval, but 55% don't. So we can, you know, react in due course once we know what's gonna happen and, obviously, some of the data and the inflationary pressures, you know, start to show up in our data that the regulators expect to see. So I think overall, you know, we're well-positioned to navigate. This isn't you know, anything, you know, terribly new as far as monitoring loss cost trends. But it is an emerging policy tariff environment, so it is somewhat unique in that respect. Think that's what I would say, Brian.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nTerrific. That was great. And then just one really quick one here. Renewal written price increases in small business, they jump around a little bit. But we saw it go from 7.4% to 6.2%. Is that a mix issue? Or is there something else going there? Yeah. I think I might ask Moe to comment, but that's mostly comp. You know, that's more heavily weighted in the first quarter, but well, you know, ex comp, you know, small business I think, was up pricing was up 12 to 12.9%. So it's still very, very robust, Brian, but little sequentially down due to comp, I think, Moe.\n\nMorris Tooker - Executive (likely Head of Business Insurance or similar) (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. The only other impact in there, Brian, was our ENS binding was marginally down. Everything else is really strong. The BOP is really strong. Auto is really strong. So we're really optimistic about the pricing that we're feeling in small business in general. Managing comp tightly, and I think you'll see in our numbers really strong growth in the E and S binding. We feel like that's in a really healthy place and we'll continue to push into that space.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

As I look at the underlying combined in business insurance, it you know, an outstanding 88.4% underlying combined. It looked like the mid-large kind of sort of let the combined go up by 1.4 points, and then it was helped by small and specialty. Maybe elaborate a little more on the pricing environment. Do you see more pressure in mid and large going forward? And you know, given the resilience you just touched on with small mid and specialty, you know, that remains strong and then net net, are you confident in your underlying combined kinda holding in this vicinity going forward. So you know, maybe a little more on pricing and how it's both areas. And then secondly, how's it gonna hold up over time with this underlying combined? Yeah. I would say, Andrew, first, thanks for joining us. Yeah, what we talked about last quarter and what our objectives were for 2025, I remain highly confident in achieving, you know, the goals that we set out was basically sort of consistent underlying, you know, combined ratios in business insurance between years. Obviously, improvement in personal auto and then in group benefits, we were really focused on you know, getting additional rate into the paid family leave, you know, products that you see the results this quarter. So I'm gonna give you just a couple little high-level comments, and I'm just gonna ask Moe to add anything on business insurance and then Mike Fish anything on you know, group benefits. But the SME space, which broadly defined, you know, I think we're the industry leader. Continues to hold up, you know, very well. If you look at our overall price increase ex comp because comp's got its own dynamics. You know, we increased it 20 basis points to nine nine. And even if I look at know, property, you know, within the SME space, you know, we're up, you know, 18 in property pricing. Overall, GL, including excess and umbrella lines are achieved a 10.5% increase this quarter. I gave you sort of an ex comp small business pricing number that's up, you know, 12.9%. Feel really good about global specialty, you know, up 6.2 in pricing. So giving you just some highlights, you know, to sort of demonstrate, you that we're executing well. The SME market, even in the aspects of global specialty where we play. Is holding up better. It tends to be the more profitable segment, you know, that, you know, we are, you know, one of the leaders in. So Moe, what would you add? And then, Mike Fish, I'll ask you to add some. That was a fulsome response. The only thing I would add, Andrew, is it's a competitive market, we talk about it from quarter to quarter. But we are the underwriters to really right to make the right choices. And I think we again, felt the middle team being really, I think, really strong on the decisions they were making on workers' comp I think we've pointed to our specialty team making the strong decisions on public D and O. That book is less than a hundred million dollars. So they have managed that down. So think where the pricing is not holding up to what we do, our underwriters are making the right choices. I'm really proud of the way they're executing. I think what we're moving into is an underwriter's market where as the market moves and maybe moves a little bit more dynamically, the best underwriters will win, and we hope to be in that population that will continue to outperform.\n\nMike Fish - Executive (exact title not specified, likely related to benefits or business insurance) (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nHey, Andrew. This is Mike. I would just, maybe add a couple of comments on the benefits side. So overall, we feel really good about where we're writing business both on the new, you know, sort of new sales front and the renewal front in terms of the pricing. So again, holding on to margin, in particular, we've seen you know, strong disability experience emerge, and so that's some favorable experience we have coming into our book. But again, on the other side, we've got some pressure on paid family leave that we've talked about two or three quarters in a row, and you saw in the quarter really a nice improvement at 20 improvement on paid family leave really driven by rate that we put into the book. We put double-digit rate increases into that book of business about $260 million. So not a large book, but, you know, we put some nice rate action in there, and persistency held up strong in the high eighties. So very pleased with that outcome.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nAnd then just as a follow-up, and that was very helpful. Moe, you just mentioned underwriter's market, and that kinda contrasts a little bit with net written premium being up an excellent 10% in the quarter for business insurance overall, and it looks like across, you know, all the different areas, Now, Chris, does your high degree of confidence encompass you know, a pretty robust net written premium growth trajectory? Or could that underwriter's market that Moe is talking about start to start to end up with positive about both. Andrew. Not to cut you off, but I feel positive on both. I feel positive that we could continue to grow and capture market share. Market share with our product sets, with our distribution. While being disciplined, as Moe said, from an underwriting side. And I think the strongest evidence of that is, you know, we're shrinking our comp book right now as we speak. Just because we're not getting the, you know, the rate across the board that we want. But Moe, you don't that. Say that conflicting, do you? No. Not at all. I would say, Andrew, in this marketplace, with how much that we have built and in some places we are I think, subscale to what we wanna be. We certainly the flow continues to be strong. We continue to enjoy really strong partnerships with our distribution. We have one, you know, I think a very rare network of distribution partners that few can match. And we feel those partners wanting to consolidate to fewer markets So we are enjoying that as well. So the growth opportunities that are out there, again, subject to the market holding up, we will take advantage of the flow that we see coming through. And where the rates aren't where they need to be, as I said a minute ago, we'll pull back. And I think that's really what I'm asking you to think about is we can and do believe we can do both. Manage the market and grow. And I think that's what the best underwriters in the market will do over time.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):"

Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nElyse, I would say, you know, we made no changes. Obviously, well-discussed the changes we made in '24 and how that affected the '25 pricing. You could see, you know, what we talked about from an achieved rate. And I think across, you know, the board or achieving pricing ahead of lost cost trends and feel good where we're at. Where we're at right now. Excluding, you know, workers' compensation, which has its, you know, own ecosystem, I think in personal lines, if you well, you asked the BI question, but personal lines has its own.

Is that a decision that you've made, you know, that you go try to take price? Or, you know, any color that you could provide there. As you think about the potential tariff impacts need for price, right, and you guys just about getting back to target margins in the book?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. It's, yeah. It's a good question. Obviously, you know, facts and circumstances will present themselves more clearly as far as options, opportunities. I think the nuance I want you to make sure you hear is that we set loss cost trends and picks, you know, at the beginning of the year that we thought were very prudent. Thoughtful, and provided a range of outcomes. And we have, obviously, the ability then to absorb some level of inflationary tariff, you know, type pressure. But beyond that, yeah, I mean, our goal is to keep up with loss cost trends and earn a risk-adjusted an adequate risk return on our capital deployed. So by definition, if we exhaust all other options, we're gonna have to go back in and tweak rates."

You know, to what we thought, but still slightly favorable is negative. Compared to, you know, what we planned for in the first quarter. And, you know, we've talked about it before.

I don't think there's anything going on in the marketplace that's surprising us on comp right now. Our retentions are basically on plan across BI. Our rates is, as Chris said, are slightly better than expectations. Our trends are holding up well. The profitability is holding up well. I think it's a competitive market.

Just given the growth that you guys have been seeing?\n\nBeth Costello - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nHey, David. It's Beth. I think we've, you know, asked answered this question before on the expense ratio that over time, we would expect to see some improvement come through from an operating leverage perspective. But not expecting some dramatic or significant step change. I think it would be gradual. And also, as we've also talked about in the past, we also look very closely at the things that we wanna invest in in our businesses and using those expense dollars appropriately. And that investment is going to help drive our top line, help drive our loss cost, and then ultimately help drive efficiency.

I would tell you from a trend side, obviously, you know, we made our adjustments, you know, last year, but there's nothing fundamentally changing. You know, right now from an overall trend side that would change our view that social inflation is gonna continue to be a problem for society. It's gonna continue to tax and constrain innovation in my judgment. And we need, as an industry, to continue to fight and get the necessary reforms in place at the state level. And we had, you know, a good win. The industry had a good win in Georgia. You know, with some of its reforms that, you know, the governor put into place. So we feel good about that.

And the teams are making sure that on all the GL lines and the auto lines, that we are getting rate in excess of trend, and that's a key goal for the year.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. That's helpful. Maybe switching gears a bit to ENS. Feel like you all have been taking a lot of share in E and S for a while. I know it's still a small line of business. But you mentioned 29% growth and a tremendous opportunity, I think, the exact wording used in the prepared remarks. Are you able to kind of unpack how what's is it you know, are you kind of using relationships with, like, programized relationships with some of the big ENS carriers, or is this kind of is there any kind of secret sauce or underlying kind of drivers that's causing the market share taking? Yeah. We do have secret sauce, but I'm not gonna talk about it. So, Moe, what would you say? No. I would break it into two pieces, Mike. One, in small business E and S binding space, I think really the secret sauce is us taking all of the technology and tools that have made us so successful in the retail market into the wholesale market. So that is what we continue to do and we continue to open up locations with the wholesale partners. So we are not open we basically do it by location by location. Location by partner. And I think the growth that you're seeing is not only the flow is strong, but we are continuing to open up locations with new wholesale locations. And so, again, I think the summary in the binding ENS space is we continue to be really optimistic about our growth there. Again, predicated on just we're making it easier for our partners to do business with us relative to peers. In the global specialty space where we think it's just a brokerage play, again, the flow continues to be strong. We grew 12% the quarter in that space, as Chris referenced in his opening remarks. There too, we are a very, very strong construction market and a key partner to the wholesalers. And construction liability primarily. What we are doing in that space is more about building out the other lines in the marine, the nonconstruction casualty lines property, And just because of the partnership we've established on the construction side, I think we can continue to grow share in the brokerage space as well. So we're really optimistic about E and S overall. And the continued growth in that space.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

And just wanted to hear about some of the things you're doing, if there's anything specific that you're targeting for us to think about.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. I would say, Alex, mean, you know, the first priority remains, you know, the same, you know, getting the overall book back to targeted margins, which we think we're well on track of achieving. By midyear. Particularly in personal auto. Homeowners, I think, has actually performed, you know, very well consistently for a number of, you know, quarters now as a team, you know, keeps pace with the lost cost trends there and elevated, you know, frequency. I think our underlying was sort of in the mid-75ish, which is very, very, you know, strong. Know? But as we sort of alluded to, we are trying to, you know, pivot to growth, you know, particularly as profitability is improved. You know, we do wanna, you know, grow know, our home and auto business. I think we have the platform to do it, which we talked about was Prevail. Prevail's in 44 states right now. Prevail makes up 75% of our new business primarily in the direct channel. And our overall from an overall in-force book prevails now is up to 25%. And the other statistic maybe that we don't talk about that frequently is you know, about 75% of our homeowners book is bundled with auto. Which I think is a high percentage, and we're proud of it. And our sales team, our sales agents, I think, are doing a good job. So I'll look to Melinda to, you know, add any other color at point in time.\n\nMelinda Thompson - Executive (likely related to Personal Lines or Distribution) (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. Thank you. The only thing I would add is that as you know, rate moderates, we certainly expect the pressure on retention to moderate as well, which would lift both premium and policy count growth. And then we've also implemented a number of new business initiatives to stimulate growth as well. So increased marketing spend, both rate and non-rate levers to support that, and then Chris mentioned, the Prevail platform to enable it.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nThat's not really helpful. Second question I had is on workers' comp reserves. And so you know, one of the things I've noticed is just your post-COVID accident, your workers' comp reserves, you know, generally just stayed in place while some of the peers have you know, maybe recognized some of the frequency benefits. And so, you know, I get that severity takes longer and maybe there's conservatism there. But I just wanted to understand, like, if like, what's your approach to those reserves? And you know, I get the question sometimes as to whether maybe there's something more problematic there or something like that. And I don't get the feeling that's the case, but I just wanted to sort of dig into that a little and understand the way you all have approached this post-COVID workers' conferences.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. Alex, I'll let Beth add her color, but let me just state emphatically. There's no problems. There's nothing problematic. There's nothing you should worry about. And but we feel good about the balance sheet because it's we've worked hard to put the balance sheet in the position that it is today.\n\nBeth Costello - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. I would echo what Chris just said. You know, we are given just the nature of that line of business. We are cautious just to see those reserves season. And, you know, take the appropriate action you know, when we feel comfortable. So the releases that we did this quarter know, were 2020 and prior. We look at our reserves every quarter, and, you know, evaluate anything that, we might need to adjust. But, again, those as you know, those reserves stay on the balance sheet for a long period of time. And, we just wanna be cautious as we think about the more recent years.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

So our, you know, variable our that will be exposed to variable rates are about $6 billion. So think about that as roughly 10%.

Yeah. I think a lot of people are interested in it, but you know, interest doesn't translate to execution, doesn't translate to history and experience. And know-how. So but it yeah.

Or is it a work in progress?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nJosh, I'm not even gonna respond to that baiting. So, yeah, I would unintentional. Yeah. No. Okay. Very good. I would say, yeah, we're pleased. With the agent channel as it exists today. We've seen nice growth on a bundled basis primarily. And we are turning back on broad-based, you know, relationships you know, that might have been a little dormant, a little it's just dormant. So, yeah, I'm encouraged. About that, and I'm just gonna ask Melinda to add her own color because she's the principal architect of getting back into the agency side of the business in a more meaningful way.\n\nMelinda Thompson - Executive (likely related to Personal Lines or Distribution) (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. Couple of things I would offer. Certainly, we have had an opportunity as profitability has come back online to reengage agents, and there's been a fair amount of marketplace disruption. And so those two things in combination with The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s retail brand are certainly an opportunity and a strategic advantage. So we're excited about what we've been able to do and the growth that we're on a relatively small base today. And then as we think about, you know, a broader pivot there is an opportunity to capitalize on our new platform. We look at Prevail, and it brings with it you know, an exceptional product, a platform, and customer experiences. That we do believe can be leveraged more broadly. So if you think about the segmentation, and the transferable capabilities coming to the agency channel over time, we think that that is an opportunity, and we've earned the right to compete more meaningfully in personal lines in the channel.\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nSo that really, means Josh, is we have some pilots that begin in two states really in the second half of the year, and we'll see how all that goes and keep you posted.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd given that policy count in home is growing as auto continues to decline. But that will hopefully will stop. Is there any risk in writing monoline home? Is that an attractive product?\n\nChristopher J. Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nIt's not our preferred approach. It happens, but it doesn't happen very frequently.\n\nMelinda Thompson - Executive (likely related to Personal Lines or Distribution) (The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.):\nYeah. Again, as Chris shared, the vast majority of our business is written on a bundled basis in the home, in the direct space and at a growing percentage of our agency business as well. I would say that our homeowners business is performed very well. We're very thoughtful about our growth. And how we think about it on a state basis. So we look at you know, how we want to grow home when we do so, and our track record is very strong. We generated a combined ratio in the low nineties over a long period of time to the last decade or so, and that compares very favorably to the industry.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

You may go ahead.\n\nKate Jorens - Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all earnings-related materials on our website. Before we begin, please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees of future performance and may differ materially from actual results. We do not assume any obligation to update these statements. Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties detailed in our recent SEC filings, news release and financial supplement, which are available on the Investor Relations section of thehartford.com. Our commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, with explanations and GAAP reconciliations available in our recent SEC filings, news release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. Chris Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, we will take your questions, assisted by several members of our management team. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford second quarter results were outstanding, with core earnings reaching nearly $1 billion. This performance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy and consistency of execution that drives our momentum. We are expanding our market presence and growing with purpose. Our strategic investments are advancing innovation across the organization to benefit customers and distribution partners. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance as we have successfully capitalized on market opportunities while maintaining strong margins. With that, let's take a closer look at second quarter performance. Highlights include top line growth in Business Insurance of 8%, with an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 88. In Personal Insurance, an underlying combined ratio of 88, with 8.7 points of improvement over prior year, an exceptional core earnings margin of 9.2% in Employee Benefits and continued solid performance in our investment portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17%. Turning to Business Insurance. Results were excellent, driven by industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise and data science advancements. Small Business delivered an excellent underlying combined ratio with record-breaking quarterly net new business premium. Strong written premium growth was fueled in part by double-digit increases in auto and in our industry-leading package product as well as a 35% increase in E&S binding premium. We are on a clear trajectory to exceed $6 billion in annual written premium in 2025. Growth in small is fueled by technology and data science advancements, which provides significant and unrivaled competitive advantages. For example, our best-in-class quoting platform is powered by intelligent automation, real-time decisioning and proprietary pricing models, differentiated by our rich historical data. Over the years, we have streamlined the submission process with intuitive workflows and advanced prefill of customer data. Our AI-driven underwriting logic suggests coverages based on business type and reflects the judgment of our most experienced underwriters. All of this delivers a seamless and efficient experience, allowing 75% of all quotes across all admitted lines of business to be bound within minutes. This provides a durable competitive advantage for us with our distribution partners. As we continue to invest in AI, we expect bindability to increase further, driving enhanced efficiency, greater scalability and sustained profitable growth. Turning to Middle & Large Business. Underlying results were excellent with solid growth. We are focused on maintaining margins and making appropriate risk decisions using enhanced underwriting tools. Middle & Large continues to advance the vision of an automated AI-driven underwriting process to enhance productivity and accelerate speed to market. Our strategic investments leverage strength in Small Business and extend those advantages to Middle Market. Over time, we believe this positions us well to capture additional market share in this space. Shifting to Global Specialty. Results were outstanding with sustained underlying margins in the mid-80s and record quarterly gross written premium of $1.3 billion. Our strong competitive position, broad product portfolio and disciplined renewal pricing drove this performance. Gross written premium in the wholesale business grew 8%, supported by growth in casualty, auto and inland marine. Global Reinsurance gross written premium grew 15%, driven by strong growth in both U.S. property and specialty casualty lines. With a diverse product portfolio and a constructive pricing environment, we remain confident in the growth potential of Global Specialty. As for pricing, Business Insurance renewal pricing, excluding workers' compensation, is strong at 8.1% and is still comfortably above the overall loss trend. Pricing execution remains highly disciplined with low double-digit increases in auto and general liability, including mid-teens increases in umbrella and excess lines. In workers' compensation, although pricing is modestly down from the first quarter, it remains within expectations. Across Business Insurance, focused expansion in property has driven 12% growth with written premium of $1 billion in the quarter. In Small Business, property pricing within our package product remained strong as we achieved 15% renewal written price increases. In general industries property, pricing is solid and above loss trends. Large property and wholesale pricing declined from the first quarter by 4 and 8 points, respectively. However, both of these lines have adequate margins and account for less than 10% of total Business Insurance property. As we continue to grow the property book, we are maintaining a consistent catastrophe risk appetite and in another active CAT quarter, our CAT losses remain below our market share. Turning to Personal Insurance. Results improved significantly over prior year. Homeowners had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by 17% written premium growth and low 70s underlying combined ratio. Renewal written pricing of 12.7%, driven by net rate and insured value increases continue to support healthy margins and reinforces a strong position in the market. Auto underlying results improved by 9.7 points to a mid-90s underlying combined ratio. We are now well positioned to profitably grow in both auto and home. This month, we introduced our Prevail offering, inclusive of auto, home and umbrella to the agency channel, unlocking additional opportunities with preferred market customers. We expect to be in 6 states by the end of the year and an additional 15 to 20 states next year. Agents are energized by the enhanced efficiency of Prevail, and have expressed strong commitment to promoting these improved offerings as new states come online. More broadly, agents and brokers at our annual summit in May conveyed a clear eagerness to deepen their partnership with us across the enterprise. They continue to recognize our ability to deliver fast, accurate solutions as a key differentiator in the market. With our ongoing investments in AI, digital tools, in overall ease of doing business, we are well positioned to grow alongside our distribution partners an"

With our ongoing investments in AI, digital tools, in overall ease of doing business, we are well positioned to grow alongside our distribution partners and strengthen our collaborative success. Moving on to Employee Benefits. Core earnings margin of 9.2% was exceptional, driven by excellent life and disability results. Persistency remained strong in the low 90s, while fully insured premium growth was flat, reflecting a competitive market. Looking ahead, we are particularly excited about our recent partnership with Nayya, which brings AI-powered personalization through benefits enrollment. This collaboration enhances digital capabilities and simplifies the benefits experience for employees through seamless integration with leading HR platforms. Improving benefit utilization enhances employee satisfaction and in turn, helps employers retain their workers. This is another example of how we are advancing our innovation strategy and delivering meaningful value to both employers and their employees. In summary, second quarter results reflect the strength of our businesses and the impact of ongoing strategic investments. It is an exciting time at The Hartford as we advance our innovation agenda. We are prioritizing practical, high-impact AI applications that augment human talent and drive productivity to better serve customers and distribution partners. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to capture additional market share, deliver profitable growth and capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $981 million or $3.41 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17%. In Business Insurance, core earnings were $697 million with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 88. Small Business continues to deliver industry-leading results with written premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89. Middle & Large Business had another quarter of strong profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 89.1 and written premium growth of 5%. Global Specialty second quarter was outstanding with an underlying combined ratio of 84.8 and written premium growth of 9%. The Business Insurance expense ratio of 30.6 improved 0.5 points from second quarter 2024, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium. In Personal Insurance, core earnings for the quarter were $94 million with an underlying combined ratio of 88. The auto underlying combined ratio of 95.2 improved 9.7 points from the 2024 period, and homeowners produced an excellent underlying combined ratio of 72.7, which improved 5.1 points. Written premium in Personal Insurance increased 7% in the second quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions. We achieved written pricing increases of 14% in auto and 12.7% in homeowners. Additionally, new business growth continues to be robust in homeowners at 47% over the prior year. Homeowners policy count continued to grow, while auto decreased as expected. We continue to expect that auto policy count will pivot to growth in 2026. The Personal Insurance second quarter expense ratio of 25.1 improved from the prior year by 1.3 points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by a higher commission ratio due to business mix. With respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year losses were $212 million before tax or 4.9 combined ratio points, primarily related to tornado, wind and hail events largely concentrated in the South and Midwest regions. As a reminder, we have a $200 million aggregate catastrophe cover, which attaches when the subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Through June 30, losses subject to the treaty were approximately $690 million, leaving $60 million before we reach the attachment point. The aggregate cover does not include losses from the Global Reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. Total P&C net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $163 million before tax, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond, commercial property and across Personal Insurance. We recorded $24 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigator's ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. We expect the remaining balance of $8 million to be amortized in the third quarter. Moving to Employee Benefits. We achieved core earnings of $163 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 9.2% reflects excellent group life and disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 68.5 increased 1.4 points from the prior year, driven by short-term disability and a slight increase in long-term disability incidents partially offset by strong claim recoveries. However, long-term disability incidence rates continue to remain favorable to historical averages and to our expectations. The group life loss ratio of 74.3 for the quarter improved 0.6 points, reflecting lower mortality, primarily driven by the accidental death product. The Employee Benefits expense ratio of 25.7 increased 1.3 points compared with 24.4 in second quarter 2024, primarily due to higher technology costs and higher staffing costs. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $107 million increased from $101 million in second quarter 2024, reflecting higher group disability sales. Turning to investments. Net investment income of $664 million increased from second quarter 2024, primarily driven by a higher level of invested assets and reinvesting at higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower yield on variable rate securities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, 20 basis points above first quarter 2025. We continue to strategically manage the portfolio, balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities, and in the quarter, reinvested at 130 basis points above the sales and maturity yield. Our second quarter annualized LP returns of 1% before tax were down from first quarter. Returns have been muted due to market uncertainty stemming from a combination of interest rates and tariff policy, which has limited valuation and sale activity in our private equity and real estate portfolios. However, with stronger public equity performance in the second quarter, we expect limited partnership returns to improve in the second half of the year, with full year 2025 returns modestly exceeding 2024. Turning to capital management. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the third quarter. As of June 30, we had $2.35 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026. In summary, we are very pleased with our outstanding performance for the second quarter and believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Kate.\n\nKate Jorens - Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford):\nThank you, Beth. We will now take your questions."

Could you remind me of the mix of in-force business in Global Specialty? And coupled with that, where are you seeing the growth? Is it small, mid, large? And what product areas?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nAndrew, thanks for joining us. I'll give you a high level and then Mo can maybe give you a little more details. But yes, it's a broad- based U.S. and international organization, right? The international organization is our syndicate in Lloyd's that is focused primarily on casualty lines, energy, marine, and you get into the U.S., the major product lines are E&O, D&O, bond. There's some specialty lines in there like cyber and EPLI. So it's quite diverse. And yes, thanks for noticing how well it's been performing over the last couple of years. But Mo, would you add anything?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nAlso in that line, Andrew, is just short of $1 billion in our Global Reinsurance business, which is a good mixture of property and casualty globally. But the opportunity set in Global Specialty, broadly, I think we're excited about the Global Re opportunity. We continue to be rather opportunistic in that space, trying to grow when the market is there, and we feel the market in the reinsurance space is fairly supportive. The wholesale space in there, again, we feel it's very supportive. I think we've talked about in the past, we have a predominantly construction casualty book, and we look to grow the other lines, including property in the marine. So we feel good growth there. And then you push into markets like Lloyd's, and there's good opportunity for there as we double down on the specialty areas we're in. And I think the last thing, which I think is fairly unique to our specialty business is the idea that we are driving specialty products into our small and middle customer base, and that's a large part of the effort of that entire team is to make sure that we are selling every specialty product that we have to as many small and middle customers as we can.\n\nAndrew Scott Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nThat was very helpful. And maybe just shifting over to Personal Lines. I mean it was pretty much strong everywhere, but in Personal Lines, it sounds like you've kind of gotten to the profitability levels that you need. But I want to get a little clarity on when you want to grow. I think, Chris, maybe in the opening remarks, it seemed like you're ready now, but then Beth kind of mentioned 2026. So when do you think you can really start growing in a meaningful way? And during this year, do you expect, in both auto and home, to see double-digit rate continue in the coming 2 quarters?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, Andrew, I would say both Beth and I and Melinda and working with Mo, now is the time to grow in Personal Lines. We worked hard to sort of get back to target margins that we wanted in this book. Everyone else in the marketplace is pivoting to growth also. So there will be competitive dynamics. But I think we have some differentiated capabilities, both in auto and home, both in our direct channel, which is our primary business, but also as we roll out our new Prevail offering and package and technology to independent agents. So I think we're feeling good. You could see we're growing our home PIF count responsibly with good discipline and not taking on too much CAT risk. And I expect, from a pure number side, to be able to begin to add PIF count in 2026, just given sort of the competitive dynamics in the rest of this year. And if I forgot part of your question, Andrew, ask it again.\n\nAndrew Scott Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nYes. Just the rate. Do you think for the balance of the year, you'll still need double-digit rate in auto and home?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, I think what I would foreshadow is, yes, double-digit rates in the third quarter in auto. We'll probably get to maybe high singles in the fourth quarter. And then home, just given sort of the inflationary pressures and ensure value increases that we need to keep up with, yes, I would expect sort of low double-digit rates in home going forward."

Chris, at the start of the year, you laid out guidance for consistent margins for the year. Halfway through, we're looking right 30 basis points deceleration. We can perhaps call that consistent. So I guess I just want to get a sense of where we sit halfway through the year and just, if there's any changes to your full year guidance for the underlying combined ratio within Business Insurance?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Thank you, Elyse. I would say 6 months into this year, I'm pretty satisfied. The team is executing, I think, exceptionally well. We made a point of emphasis on trying to hold on to margins and keeping up with trend. I think we've done that wonderfully. And I appreciate you of all people. Let's not quibble over 30 basis points. And I think we're pretty consistent with what are expected. And we still got 6 months to go to continue to perform strongly and maybe even outperform. So that's what I would share with you.\n\nElyse Beth Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my second question, within Employee Benefits, but just on the life business. Can you just expand on what drove the strong results in the quarter? And I'm particularly interested just in more color on what you're seeing with mortality.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I think Mike Fish and I will tag team here. Yes, I thought it was a strong quarter, 9.2% that's strong margins. Obviously, it's above our long-term guidance, principally driven by continued strong recoveries in LTD. We put a little bit more rate into our leave book and some of our short-term products that's contributing. And life mortality is behaving very, very nicely for us. So putting it all together, yes, really, really pleased. I think the only thing we're focused on, and it's self-evident, so we may as well talk about it, is our top line is a little flat. And I'll give you a perspective that I ultimately made the decision on was, if you look back sort of 2 years ago, really, when we were pricing 1/1/25 business, which is the big national account season, we probably, in hindsight, took a more conservative view on mortality trends. I thought we were still going to be in an endemic state, and we were pretty disciplined in trying to get additional rate into the book. I think that had the consequences of suppressing our life sales, particularly 1/1. Disability sales, I think, are holding up well. We're always going to be disciplined there, just given how quickly morbidity trends could change on you in the multiyear guarantees. But as I look at the second half of this year and into '26, I'm exceedingly optimistic about returning to a growth orientation, Mike, and I don't know if you would add anything to that color, but I'm pretty optimistic that I think we got our pricing where it needs to be, particularly post pandemic.\n\nMichael Jeffrey Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nRight, Chris. I think you covered that really well. I would just add maybe a couple of things. In the quarter, for life, in particular for the loss ratio, right? And we called out AD&D was -- we just saw some unusually favorable experience in the quarter, so that ended up being a nice contribution to the loss ratio for the quarter. And then as Chris noted, going forward, I think we're competing hard for the next 6 months, certainly of this year to finish strong for '25. And then as we turn the corner for the 1/1/26 selling cycle, I feel really optimistic. We've got a great set of capabilities. We've invested quite a bit from a technology perspective on our offering, whether it's on the absence and leave side or even digital capabilities for our life book. So again, feel good about what we're seeing in market right now and optimistic -- cautiously optimistic as I look forward over the next 6 to 9 months."

You all are seeing some good strong growth in that market. There's been a lot of discussion on calls already this quarter about big price decreases, 10%, 15%. It doesn't necessarily mean it's unprofitable down 10%, 15%. But maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that marketplace? Are you in different areas where maybe you're not seeing the level of competition and kind of the growth you're putting on there?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Brian, it's Chris. I'll start, and then I'll ask Mo to add his insights. We're overall pleased where we are with our property book, both from a growth side. I think you've seen we put up about 15% growth. Pricing, I think in the aggregate, I'll give you some numbers that might satisfy you. I think ex Global Re, for second quarter, pricing was 6.8% compared to -- excuse me, 7.9% compared to 11.8% last quarter. And as you would expect, the large property market and the wholesale property market are primarily driving those decreases. If I look at Spectrum, our BOP product, the property component in there, that's up 14.7%, and our general industry properties is at 6.1%, which we think is keeping pace with loss cost trends. So I think the team is executing well. Not all properties created equal. Our sort of small to midsized orientation, I think, is holding up well, and I think we're executing very strongly. Mo?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nYes, Brian, I'd just say the rates are generally holding up well. Yes, it's trending down, but still strong, as Chris talked about. I think, in our core small and middle, I think we still see opportunity. We still see a solid starting point. And as we talked about in the opening script, there is a bit of pressure -- a bit of a larger pressure in larger property in the wholesale lines, where, again, the starting point is good, but we're watching those spaces closely.\n\nBrian Robert Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGreat. And then a follow-up question. I'm just curious, obviously, a big admitted market, but you also have some E&S type businesses. Maybe talk a little bit about the dynamics between those 2. Are you seeing a little more appetite admitted versus E&S? And then also on that topic, we've been hearing some complaints about some MGAs out there and kind of what's your perspective on that and using MGAs?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nYes. Brian, I wouldn't say that there's incredible flow back into the admitted space. We see it, but I think broadly, our flow into our E&S offerings is strong. And as a reminder, we have the offering in Small Business, which is our binding space. And then obviously, we have the wholesale brokerage in our Global Specialty segment. And the flows continue to be really strong, I wouldn't say dramatically different than the past couple of quarters. So -- and that's property and liability coming into the E&S space, just in terms of submission volume. So we haven't seen a huge pivot back or that flow has changed. And then the opportunity set, I think we still feel really good about. And our -- again, in both Small Business and the Global Specialty space, our ability to grow into those, we feel good about and a pretty broad based. I may have missed the second part of your question, Brian...\n\nBrian Robert Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMGAs, right? We've heard some complaints about MGAs.\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nYes. There are some pockets of our business. It's not a major -- we don't feel the MGAs in the core admitted retail, small and middle space, which is obviously where we're at. We don't feel strongly there. But we do feel pockets in financial lines and some of the other specialty lines that are -- I would agree with some of the other commentary that's out there, where there is an overcapacity, and there is some disruption that those MGAs are creating, but it's not a huge impact for us in the core space."

So I'm just curious, that annualized investment yield ex LPs has kind of drifted in the mid-4s for over a year now despite the reinvestment yields being meaningfully higher. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Over time, if the yield curve stays the same, would the annualized investment yield ex LPs kind of glide path up to that 5.9% range that's in the slide deck? Or am I missing something because it's just a very healthy spread, much more so than your peers kind of for the investment yield to glide path up over time.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nMike, I'll let Beth add her commentary. I think what's important to know is we haven't changed philosophically our asset allocation models, our model portfolio. You've seen duration being pretty consistent at 4 within the P&C business, 5 in Group Benefits. So I'll let Beth get into maybe any special securities that we're adding into the portfolio. But generally, it's steady as she goes and no major changes to our balance sheet philosophy.\n\nBeth A. Costello - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. The only thing I'll add, Mike, as you think about the overall yield and comparing that is, as I referenced in my prepared remarks, we obviously have felt the impact of lower yields on variable rate securities. So that obviously puts a little bit of pressure on that overall yield, we need to take that into consideration. And then we also sometimes have other investments, not LP investments, that also can have a little bit of volatility that you can see quarter-to-quarter. But as Chris said, nothing significant that I would point to as a change in our philosophy. Our yield this quarter on our purchases being above the sales and maturity yield. Some of that is also just the average life of the securities we purchased were a bit longer than the ones that we sold. So that impacted a little bit as well. But again, as Chris said, I wouldn't point to anything significant change overall.\n\nMichael David Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Got it. Good point maybe on the floating rate, but I need to think through more. My follow-up, just pivoting to Business Insurance. In terms of policy count retention levels in Small Business and Middle Market, I just want to -- maybe don't think about it this way, but is it fair to say that over long periods of time, you're kind of trying to hit kind of a mid-80s versus the lower 80s today? Or is that just not -- it just depends on the environment and there's lots -- you obviously give us new business sales and everything else. But is there anything we should be thinking about there in terms of their retention levels currently and how those could trend?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nMike, it's Mo. I would say it's a little bit different between small and middle. In small, you can see our numbers historically in the mid-80s. We do have a dynamic of which is different than the middle space where we have small businesses just going out of business, that's a higher impact in the small space, but -- and we do feel a little bit more churn in the middle space. So we do expect an incrementally lower retention in the middle space. But I would say what you see in the IFS is pretty much on plan with where we want to be, and I wouldn't expect anything dramatically different in the future."

I think with the Small Business, you referred to the usage of AI leading to a 75% buying ratio within minutes. So I guess just when you talk about these things, would I -- does the 75% represent the final destination? Or is this some sort of -- is there some sort of aspirational target in the background you're thinking about? Or maybe perhaps you're thinking about using this technology and spilling it over into your Middle Market business? Just some more color on the technology comments, please?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. I think the last point you made is the key point, I would share is that small has led the way in a lot of innovation, whether it be -- you want to call it AI, automation, speed, accuracy, using our rich data sets. And we are working on emulating that in Middle Market and certain aspects of Global Specialty. So that is the playbook. I would say beyond 75%, look, I could be flippant and just put out 100% would be a good number, too. But I think it's realistic that there always will be some deviation that will require human intervention, particularly as maybe you go up from a larger scale and a larger account side in small. But again, very pleased where we're at. Obviously, it's a key differentiator. And just now, we're committed to leading the way in AI, particularly as we think about underwriting, claims and overall operations. But Mo, what would you add?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nGreg, I'd just add from an underwriting perspective. In the space that we compete in the small and middle space, speed really, really matters to get an efficient answer back to our agents. So we are finding that the speed that we've accomplished in small, that's 75% of everything we quote, and getting that closer to 90% over time is a hugely competitive space to be in, just because that time is real money because people are just trying to get through submissions and maintain the margins that are hard to get in the small space. And again, we think that speed is equally as important into the middle space. So we think this is a competitive advantage in both segments today that we'll look to grow in the future.\n\nCharles Gregory Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nOkay. Thanks for the clarification there. I know the adverse cover, you used all of it as it relates to the annual reserve review and the asbestos. And I tried to shy away from modeling questions, but it seems appropriate given that you're going to have a year-end review. And maybe it might be appropriate for you to revisit how you want us to -- or how you would like to frame up the reserve review as we go into the second half of the year and what we should be thinking about in our models?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nI'm going to refrain from exact guidance, but I would say a couple of points. Obviously, you know the bookkeeping that we do on any ADC that we begin to get recoveries from, which goes through net income as opposed to core. So the toggle between core and net income on some of these runoff blocks, I think, will be important. We're not projecting -- we have not given you a time frame when we expect any recoveries on the A&E ADC, but they will come at some point in the future. And I would say, without knowing the data in this year's study, I suspect we're not going to see anything dramatically different than we've experienced in the past. There's still lawyers out there that are pressing for higher settlements. They're still environmental exposures. There's talc, there's mesothelioma, that's still happening in the marketplace. So I don't know what to say, Greg, other than I don't see a lot of change."

I guess that was just maybe directionally a little different than I would have guessed, given I think the Small Business pricing is more definitively in excess of loss cost trend versus Middle & Large at this point. Any help you can provide us in just thinking through like the year-over-year in those areas of Business Insurance?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, I'll start and Mo can add. I think it's pretty simple. Last year, I think in small, we experienced a real non-CAT weather benefit that didn't reoccur this year. And if I look at our sort of actual results to assumptions on property, we're right on expectations of where we are, maybe 2/10 ahead with non-weather CAT benefit. But I think it's just a compare in both middle and small, I think, are performing really well with our property books.\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nYes. We're right on expectations in terms of where we want to be.\n\nTaylor Alexander Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nYes. Understood. It was more the comps. Second question I have on workers' comp. I just wanted to get a feel for how things are trending there? If there's any kind of impact embedded from California and hopefully, we get some relief from that as the pricing comes in next year. So I'm just trying to understand if that has been a headwind sort of embedded in Business Insurance that I should think through. And just also, like if -- I think the comments on pricing ex workers' comp were that they were comfortably ahead of loss trend. But just wondering if you can say the same including workers' comp.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nWell, I think we always exclude workers' comp because it's sort of its own ecosystem and its own dynamics. I would just clarify, California is actually a very good state for us comp-wise. So you should not be thinking of California as a problem for our book in California. California, again, is unique in a lot of ways. But our book is performing exceedingly well there. I think the trends that I spoke to first to second quarter is pricing only. And we have not changed our loss picks in any of our product lines compared to where we thought we would be. So as much as pricing deviates maybe a little bit in comp here, it hasn't affected our picks. So first quarter, we talked about all-in sort of pricing up 3/10 of 1 point, probably turned negative this quarter in about 0.5 point range. But again, unaffected any reported results because we have a -- we made prudent overall loss picks and assumptions that are still holding. So that's the only additional data point I would give to you, but I'll look to Mo and say anything else you want to share with Alex?\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nI would say, again, I think it's important to note that pricing in comp in both small and middle is right on expectations as well. So there's nothing going on in the quarter that's out of pattern for what we expected to have. And in terms of California, again, we are in great shape to Chris' point from a profitability in California. And we've been watching the cumulative trauma for some time. So I don't think anything is terribly surprising there either."

I guess if I think about that in the context of your margins today being pretty well in excess of the targeted range, I'm just wondering if you're happy to sacrifice a bit of margin in order to get some growth in EB, and if you think that should come back to your 6% to 7% target range fairly quickly.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nThanks for the question, Wes. It's hard for us to think like that. So I'll just be honest. I mean we're pricing products with the 6% to 7% view of, I'll call it, prudent assumptions that obviously has a range around it from an outcome perspective. And you would say, the last 3, 4 years, we've been on the benefit side of the range of outcome. So remember, particularly in life products, I mean, we're making 4-, 5-, 6-year guarantees and that's a long-term commitment with potentially a lot of variability around mortality outcomes. So what I alluded to, though, is that when we looked hard at our endemic pricing coming out of COVID, we've stripped that out now, so I would say we're pretty clean from a historical trend side. And I think that will allow us to be equally competitive, maybe if not more, while not just sacrificing price and rate. But Mike Fish, what would you add?\n\nMichael Jeffrey Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford):\nYes, Wes, I would just add maybe just a couple of points there. I'd say when you look at our product set, we've also -- we don't talk about it a lot, but we've got some nice products in our supplemental health line, and we're seeing nice low double-digit growth in those lines, and we'll continue to work hard at growing that book of business. It is a smaller book of business for us. But again, we'll push hard into that market. And then secondly, as Chris noted on the pricing front, have you think, too, about where our margins are coming in. When we look at our renewal business, in other words, in-force and what we're doing rate there versus new, right? So on renewal, we're really working hard to maintain those higher margins. So obviously, we're pleased with the results. We've got persistency that's in the low 90s. So when we're putting that together with the profitability of that in-force book very, very favorable. And then Chris noted going forward on new business, we're going to compete aggressively. We feel really good about where our picks are on both the life side as well as disability. And then lastly, I would just add, we've talked a bit about the paid family medical leave product line and we've put a little over 20 points of rate into that product line in the first and second quarter, and we've maintained strong persistency there as well. So we'll keep a close watch on utilization rates. But when I put that all together, I feel really optimistic about our growth outlook for the next 12 months or so.\n\nWesley Collin Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGreat. No, that's really helpful color. I guess pivoting to personal auto. There's been a couple of headlines again over the past few days around tariffs. Just wondering if there's any updates on your thoughts on tariffs and I guess, relatedly, if the AARP relationship, does that have -- is that cohort or demographic influence how tariffs might impact The Hartford relative to peers in personal auto?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nWhat I would say, Wes, is actually, I'm feeling a little better about tariffs and particularly on auto parts and new cars, given what the administration was able to agree with Japan and Europe. So everything that we've talked about last time is sort of being a modest impact for 2025 and any tariff increases that can be absorbed in our loss picks there and are relatively minor, I think it's holding. The obviously, watch area for the industry is just what happens in '26 and sort of beyond. But I'm feeling actually a little more optimistic about the impact on at least auto tariffs just given the recent agreements."

And how should we be thinking about the sustainability of that, noting that you guys might have some ramping of the Personal Lines marketing spend?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes, I think you got it right. I mean it's good operating leverage with the earned premiums that's coming through, given all the rate that we put into the book. I would say just on Personal Lines, if there's a call out, we probably front-loaded advertising a little bit in the first half of the year, but we're still planning on a 10% increase in our overall marketing spend in Personal Lines this year. So there's nothing really dramatic that's changing there. And I think the continuous improvement mindset that the organization has that has been led by Beth is producing efficiency gains across the organization. So I feel pretty good about where we're at expense-wise.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. That makes sense. Just pivoting to the Small Commercial growth, the $6 billion in premium for 2025. It looks like growth would need to accelerate just a little bit in the second half to get there.

I would not say there's a different story for the second half of the year. I think we are still really favorable about the Small Business space in total. We continue to bite our time on comp. As you can feel, that's relatively flat for us. But outside of that, our package business owner product, the auto, E&S binding, we're still very favorable on the growth prospects across Small Business."

I think you got it right, David. It's in that 3% range. Still, again, well within our 5% picks. I don't -- I know there's always discussion on medical, broad-based medical inflation. But again, we continue to -- and you know the workers' comp industry is somewhat insulated from broad-based medical inflation. So feel comfortable. It's always a watch area. We got our listening post. We got our data analysis. We'll take corrective action if need be, but I think it's fairly well under control.\n\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. Helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up just for Business Insurance as a whole. I know last year, you guys spoke about having, I think it was about 1.5 points of favorable non-CAT property experience versus plan. It sounds like that continues to come in maybe a touch better than your expectation. I guess, are you guys -- I guess, how do you think about that sort of non-CAT weather plan? And how do you consider changes that you guys have made in terms of terms and conditions and other factors that maybe means that, that could be a little bit more durable?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Maybe we weren't clear before, or I wasn't clear. But I would say that there is no, through 6 months, major favorability in non- CAT weather, maybe a small amount, I think I mentioned 2/10. So I think we're right on our plans across, again, BI with our property underwriting results. But Mo, would you add anything...\n\nAdin Morris Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford):\nMaybe a little bit of texture, David. I think middle is a little bit better than expectations and small is right on expectations. And I think what gives us hope is where you went. The terms and conditions broadly from our seat and our portfolio, the terms and conditions are really holding up well, deductibles across the space. So I think we feel -- again, I don't know if it's durable or not, but it bounces around a little bit and -- but the terms and conditions are what give me hope that, again, our expectations should be within reach."

It's still a burden. It's not fair. It's not what our court system was intended to. But I'm also equally optimistic that more and more people across the industry and businesses are getting involved and trying to take a legislative corrective action. We work through our trade group in a lot of those discussions, but then there's individual contributions and discussions. So it's still alive and well. And I think the overall trends of sort of the tactics involved are continuing. I don't see any real differences in our trends, whether it be time bar demands, whether it be earlier representation with lawyers on sort of simple claims. So yes, but there has been progress in certain states, particularly in the Southeast that have enacted reforms that have been signed by their governors, and we'll continue to sort of fight the good fight and really highlight this. I think it's getting a little bit more national attention, particularly in D.C. and I was really actually encouraged by former Attorney General Barr's comments on the need just to put some limits on these injury claims, including noneconomic limits. So it's getting the attention and hopefully, legislation will come because that's what's needed to enact it at a state and/or federal level.\n\nJon Paul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nDo you have any sense of any way that you or anybody else could measure the impact of litigation finance?\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nAre you being serious?

I mean we're spending more time and money on something that turned our judicial system into a gambling system. Are you serious?\n\nJon Paul Newsome - Analyst (Piper Sandler):\nNo, I apologize. What I mean is this, there's obviously some underlying social inflation issues that come from court changes and other things. And then there's pieces that are coming from the litigation part in particular. And I was wondering if there's any ways to sort of bifurcate what's purely because of the litigation finance stuff or from other sources? That's the question.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nOkay. I hear you. Point taken. Yes, there's a lot of lawyers inflating sort of average cost and then there's sort of the nuclear verdicts change. I think we have -- and I know the industry has got measurements on both. I don't have them in front of me, but both are contributing to the problem, Paul."

You clearly have a very strong combined ratio in the mid-90s core combined ratio in the high 80s. Under any historical environment, you certainly are very well positioned to grow. But I just want to understand -- get a better understanding of your competitive environment. It feels like multiple carriers in the Personal Line also have similar underwriting profile at this time. Can you maybe just help us think about, as you pivot into growth, what is the competitive dynamic looks like for homeowner and for auto? Is it easier for you to grow right now given your combined ratio? Or is it actually not that easy? Just curious your view on that.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford):\nYes. Thank you, Bob. I'm going to add my point of view, but I'd like Melinda Thompson to add hers, who runs Personal Lines. I think it's not that easy to grow, or else we would have been growing maybe at a faster historical rate because there is good competition. Our primary channel right now is still the AARP endorsement with the direct response models, which we think does give us a competitive advantage to really help a mature customer with policy decisions, with limit discussions, with how claims would be handled. So that's important to that cohort. But we're taking sort of the chassis that we rebuilt in that area and trying to apply it through independent agents, particularly with a similar sort of mature market approach. And we're quite confident with our independent agents, just given our historical relationship with distribution partners that sell both personal and commercial, particularly small insurance. So again, we think from a relationship side there, we think our product is competitive and has the right features and benefits that customers would like over a longer period of term but it is still a competitive environment. But Melinda, what would you add?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nThank you, Chris. I would agree with you. The environment is healthy and a number of competitors are aggressively positioning for new business in the marketplace. And so certainly, as we think about our overall position, growth is going to require 2 things. One is retention improvement and then new business. And so as I think about moderating rate that is -- that we will experience throughout '25 and into '26, that pressure on retention will also moderate. And then we have been implementing a number of initiatives to stimulate new business. Chris mentioned the agency and what we are doing there, the reengagement efforts have been meaningful in our new business. And on top of that, we've implemented some rate and non-rate levers, the marketing spend. So all of those things together are really about supporting growth.\n\nJian Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGot it. Really appreciate that. But maybe just a follow-up on that point. Would you say that maybe auto and like -- is there a significant difference between auto and home in terms of the competitive environment? Or would you say they're kind of similar in terms of being both a competitive environment today?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford):\nI would acknowledge some differences there. Certainly, home comes with capacity constraints. And so there is, I would say, some dynamics that are a little bit different than auto that play out. We are growing home. We feel very good about how we underwrite that book, how we performed over a sustained period of time and how we are positioned. So we are growing that line. And the challenge certainly on auto, the amount of rate that has come through auto is what's pressuring the retention there a little bit differently."

And now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford delivered outstanding third quarter results with core earnings of $1.1 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, both records for the company. These results reflect the strength of our franchise and disciplined execution of our strategy. We continue to grow top line while maintaining strong margins in a dynamic environment, supported by investments that advance our underwriting discipline while deepening relationships with customers and distribution partners. Highlights in the quarter include written premium growth in Business Insurance of 9% with an underlying combined ratio of 89.4%. In Personal Insurance, an underlying combined ratio of 90%, a 3.7-point improvement over prior year. In Employee Benefits, an outstanding core earnings margin of 8.3% and continued solid performance in the investment portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 18.4%. Let's take a closer look at third quarter performance. In Business Insurance, third quarter results reflect excellent growth with strong underlying margins, sustaining momentum from the first half of the year. Our small business franchise continues to set the standard for growth and profitability in the industry, delivering record-breaking new business premium with strong underlying combined ratios. Written premium growth of 11% was fueled by double-digit increases in our industry-leading package product and auto. E&S binding also delivered exceptional results with written premium up 47%, reaching over $100 million in the quarter. These results reflect the power of our underwriting expertise, AI-driven capabilities and strong digital platforms built on years of strategic investments. Written premium is expected to exceed $6 billion in 2025, representing 10% growth over prior year. Turning to Middle & Large business. Growth was outstanding with solid underlying margins. Written premium increased 10%, underscoring the strength of our diversified portfolio. This performance was fueled by robust new business generation, strong retention levels and solid pricing execution across the lines. Our underwriting approach continues to guide us towards opportunities that deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns while ensuring we remain selective and disciplined. Shifting to Global Specialty. Results were excellent with another quarter of underlying margins in the mid-80s. This performance reflects targeted growth strategies alongside strong risk and pricing fundamentals. Net written premium grew by 5% driven by U.S. financial lines, bond and across international, partially offset by a 3% dip in wholesale, primarily due to a decline in new construction projects. Within Global Specialty, we are taking advantage of innovative solutions that combine our specialized underwriting expertise with advanced technology and broad distribution of our small business franchise. Through our [ One Hartford ] approach, agents and customers can seamlessly quote and bind comprehensive coverages in a single unified experience. For example, this approach is resonating with small and midsized business customers who require professional and management liability coverage, not addressed by the standard package product. We remain focused on helping all business customers succeed by using digital capabilities, leveraging our broad distribution network and offering a comprehensive product suite that meets more of their needs. Moving to pricing. Business Insurance renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was 7.3%, above overall loss trend. Pricing execution remains highly disciplined. General liability remained firm and above loss trend, supported by rate increases and proactive underwriting actions focused on segmentation, limits management and geographic optimization. Excess and umbrella lines delivered double-digit pricing increases and primary lines moderated slightly while still in the high single digits. Despite modest easing this quarter, auto pricing remained near 11%, while workers' compensation pricing was slightly up from the second quarter. Across business insurance, property written premium grew 11% to $800 million with expectations for full year premium to reach $3.3 billion. Over the past 3 years through the team's thoughtful and disciplined strategy, including CAT management, the Business Insurance property book grew 50%. In Small business, property pricing within the package product remained strong, achieving 12% renewal written price increases. In general industries, property pricing was relatively consistent with the second quarter and above loss trend. Other property lines, primarily E&S and Large representing approximately 20% of the property book, achieved renewal pricing increases of 1.2%, up nearly 2 points from the second quarter. Turning to Personal Insurance. Results continued to improve over prior year. Homeowners had a strong quarter, highlighted by 10% written premium growth in mid-70s underlying combined ratio. Renewal written pricing remained flat to the second quarter at 12.6% driven by net rate and insured value increases. Auto underlying results improved by 3.6 points in the quarter with a year-to-date underlying combined ratio in the mid-90s. While Personal Insurance underlying margins are at targeted levels, total PIF growth continues to be impacted by a highly competitive market. We are pleased with growth in agency, where policies in force grew 17% over prior year, including 4% in auto. In the third quarter, we introduced Prevail to retail distribution, bringing new product, technology and experiences to our agency partners. We are now live in 6 states, and we'll continue to roll out Prevail Agency over time with 30 state launches planned by early 2027. Initial results are positive, with agents excited about our improved performance in competitive positioning with preferred market customers. Prevail represents a meaningful investment in our businesses, now benefiting both direct and retail channels. Earlier this month, the Hartford senior leadership team attended the CIAB Insurance Leadership Forum, a premier property and casualty industry event. We met with more than 50 key distributors and reinforced our commitment to consistent execution and strategic alignment. Brokers and agents recognize our in"

Brokers and agents recognize our industry-leading digital capabilities, as clear differentiators. We left the forum with increased confidence in the strength of our independent distribution relationships, positioning us to capture additional market share over time. Moving on to Employee Benefits. The core earnings margin of 8.3% was driven by excellent life and strong disability results. Persistency remained strong in the low 90s while fully insured premium and sales were flat year-over-year, reflecting a competitive market and lower large case sales in 2025. Quote activity and known sales for 2026 are trending very favorably as recent investments in technology and customer-facing tools gain traction in the marketplace. In terms of capital management, yesterday, we announced a 15% increase in the common quarterly dividend, continuing a track record of annual dividend increases supported by earnings power and strong capital generation. In addition, we are pleased that both S&P and Moody's upgraded the debt and financial strength ratings of the Hartford. Commentary from the agencies highlighted our effective risk selection and sophisticated pricing strategies, which have positively impacted underwriting performance across business cycles, with expectations for continued strength, supported by well-diversified revenues and earnings. In closing, as we enter the final quarter of 2025, our financial strength disciplined execution and strategic investments position the company to sustain strong results by leveraging industry-leading tools, underwriting expertise and advanced data science, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate a dynamic market cycle and deliver superior returns for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $1.77 billion or $3.78 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 18.4%. In Business Insurance, core earnings were $723 million with written premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.4%. Small business continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.8%. Middle & Large business had another strong quarter with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. Global Specialty's third quarter was solid with written premium growth of 5% and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8%. The Business Insurance expense ratio of 31.1% was relatively flat from the 2024 period, however, increased sequentially as the impact of earned premium leverage was offset by higher incentive compensation and benefit costs. In Personal Insurance, core earnings were $143 million with an underlying combined ratio of 90%. Homeowners delivered an underlying combined ratio of 74.4%, a 1-point improvement over the prior year. Auto underlying results improved by 3.6 points in the quarter and remain in line with expectations, reflecting typical seasonality as the year progresses. The Personal Insurance third quarter expense ratio of 25.8% was relatively flat from the 2024 period. Written premium in Personal Insurance increased 2% in the third quarter. We achieved written pricing increases of 11.3% in auto and 12.6% in homeowners. With respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year losses were $70 million before tax for 1.6 combined ratio points, which included $37 million of favorable prior quarter development. Through September 30, we have reached the $750 million attachment point for our aggregate property catastrophe treaty, which means that CAT losses of up to $200 million in the fourth quarter would be covered by the treaty. As a reminder, the aggregate cover does not include losses from the global reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. Total P&C net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $95 million before tax, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation and personal auto liability and physical damage. We recorded $8 million of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which has now been fully amortized. As a reminder, the A&E ADC cover was exhausted in 2024, so any development from the fourth quarter A&E study will impact core earnings. Moving to Employee Benefits. Core earnings of $149 million and a core earnings margin of 8.3% reflect excellent group life and strong disability performance. The group life loss ratio of 74.2%, improved 3.3 points, reflecting lower mortality across both term and accidental life products. The group disability loss ratio of 70.6% increased 2.7 points from the prior year. Last year included a benefit of 2.2 points related to the long-term disability recovery rate assumption update, while current year long-term disability trends were slightly higher as expected. This was partially offset by pricing increases earning into our paid family and medical leave products. The Employee Benefits expense ratio of 26.7% increased 1.4 points, primarily driven by higher staffing costs, including increased incentive compensation and benefits, increased investments in technology and a higher commission ratio due to premium mix. Turning to investments. Our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. Net investment income of $759 million increased $100 million from third quarter 2024 due to income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, a higher level of invested assets and reinvesting at higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower yield on variable rate securities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, consistent with the second quarter. We continue to strategically manage the portfolio, balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities. In the quarter, we reinvested at 50 basis points above the sales and maturity yield, reflecting increased call and paydown activity on higher-yielding corporate bonds and certain structured securities. We remain focused on our ability to reinvest above the current portfolio yield. As expected, our third quarter annualized LP returns of 6.7% before tax were higher than the first half of the year, reflecting increased returns from our private equity portfolio. While still early, we anticipate fourth quarter results to be in a similar range to third quarter. Turning to capital management. As Chris mentioned, we increased our common quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share, payable on January 5, 2026. Over the past decade, we have delivered dividend increases averaging approximately 11% per year. The step-up in our dividend demonstrates our confidence in the sustained earnings power and capital generation of the organization. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. As of September 30, we had $1.95 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026. In summary, we are pleased with our outstanding performance for the third quarter and first 9 months of the year. We believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns and enhance value for all stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Kate.\n\nKate Jorens - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nThank you, Beth. We will now take your questions. Operator, please repeat the instructions for asking a question."

It looks like we're starting to see some price increases there, which is great. Do you expect that trend to continue here? And do you think there'll be at a point here in the next, call it, 12 to 18 months where maybe rate there is in line with trend. And where are we right now rate versus trend?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. Thanks for the question and joining us. I would say the workers' comp market remains consistent. When we talked about pricing this quarter, it was really up 4 times from a slight negative to a slight positive. So that's really not a meaningful move. And if you look at sort of state filings and regulatory activity across all the states, I don't see much rate increases set up for 2026 at this point in time, primarily because as you know, Brian, I mean, it's a highly profitable line is still behaving pretty well. Loss trends are stable and predictable, and it doesn't set itself up for meaningful rate increases. I think you're aware of one state had a fairly meaningful rate increase in California because their loss trends were a little outsized compared to others. So I would say it's steady as she goes. And we feel good about the profitability -- the overall profitability of the book, whether it be on an accident year basis or calendar year, particularly when you look at our reserve releases, over the last 3 years have been pretty steady and predictable.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. And then I wonder if we could just dig in a little bit more into the underlying loss ratio in business insurance and commercial insurance. So I understand that most of the year-over-year deterioration is due to the workers' comp. But if I think about the other lines of business, you talk about rate has been in excess of trend and pricing has been excess trend for a long time. Are you holding those picks kind of constant right now, given where we are with port inflation and maybe potential impacts of tariffs, or are we actually seeing improvement there, and they're just being more than offset by comp?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. I think what I'd like to do, and I know you've studied our data, but let's look at the 9-month year-over-year underlying combined ratio. Currently, it's running 88.6% versus 88.1%. And I would say within those numbers, comp is performing as we expected. So there is no change in sort of anything that we've done with comp in this accident year. And obviously, prior accident years continued to develop favorably. I think what -- if I really attribute the difference in run rates through 9 months is really incentive compensation, so an expense component, not a loss component is higher than we planned, just given overall strong ROEs that we're generating and overall profitability. So if you sort of back that out, we're within a few tenths of what we think would be sort of a consistent -- generally consistent expectation at that 88.1%. And then I would even add further attribution, if we really look at the book. We mixed in property at a good level. You saw the 10% growth. But we did mix in more national account business, which tends to have a higher underlying combined ratio, both for comp and GL, that obviously impacted another few tenths. And then if I really want to quibble and look at it even more on a refined basis, we probably had a slightly more favorable non-CAT property experience last year compared to this year. So you put that all together, and you're dealing with sort of 0.5 point. And I would even share with you, as I think about the fourth quarter and the full year, I think we'll come in slightly below 88.6%, and call it a very productive, high-quality year and feel very good."

I mean, those are phenomenal numbers in this environment. I know you touched on property a little bit, but maybe you could talk to the lines that were most strong in each of those 2 segments. And why you're able to see that kind of growth in a somewhat softening market?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nThank you, Andrew, for the question. I'll give some highlights, but I'd let Mo to cover his point of view as too. But besides the major segments, you can see those growth numbers. If you pull back our Spectrum product in small commercial, it was up 13% in the quarter. Global Re was up 14%, Business Insurance, auto, was up 10%. I referenced national accounts before, which was up 17% in the quarter, really pleased with how that book is performing and or more importantly, our reputation in the marketplace in that national account area. So I would say it was broad-based. I would even say our excess liability line was up 20%. And workers' comp, I think, grew 3% year-over-year. So I would say it was just broad-based strong performance by the team. And Andrew, you've heard us, myself and Mo talk, I mean, we've asked the team to focus on margins and maintain those margins as we head into -- as we executed here in 2025. And I really feel like the team is executing flawlessly. They know how to draw lines in the sand and say no, and move on, but also our capabilities, our digital capabilities, all the investments that we've made across all our business segments, Mo, I think, are performing well.\n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nMaybe I'll just add a couple of pieces, Chris. Yes, I think flow, Andrew, remains really good in both businesses, both in small and middle. In small, that's admitted and non-admitted, so the flow we're seeing -- you saw that Chris quoted a plus 47% growth in the E&S lines binding in Small business. The flow in admitted and non-admitted channels remain really strong in small. And I think that's just a sign of how well the technology we're creating efficiency for our agents, and we see further opportunity for consolidation in the Small business space. And then in the middle space, I think Chris referenced it. But again, we've got real specialization we've built. The technology we have in Small is -- we're taking it into middle to make that process more efficient for agents. However, I think the Middle results will be more lumpy. We showed a plus 5% in Q2. We're showing, as you saw, plus 10% in Q3. I think we're really making decisions there that we just add them up at the end of the quarter and sometimes it's going to be a great number, sometimes it's going to be an okay number. So we feel really confident about the Small and the consistency of the growth there. I just feel like the Middle may be a little bit more choppy and more dependent on market conditions.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nThat was super helpful. Shifting over to Personal lines. The auto line came in at a 97.9%, and I know there's a lot of seasonality there. But maybe you could talk about where you'd like that to kind of center? Like what would be the kind of range where you'd be very comfortable, and now that you've got the prevailed chassis kind of rolling out, do you see the policy count starting to pick up in the near future?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nAndrew, what I would say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at target margins today and feel good with what Melinda and the team have done to sort of restore our margins. As you know, we have a 12-month policy. So there's a little bit of a lag that we have to manage. So -- and I would say -- and I think we've talked about it in the past, if -- for an auto book, if we can run an underlying combined at 95% with 2 points of CAT, I feel good, and we're then in go mode to grow, which we are now. We are pivoting to growth, particularly in '26. The real opportunity, I think, for growth will be our new agency offering, which is, as I said, we're in 6 states now and 40 by early '27, which will add to incremental growth, particularly in addition to our AARP response. But a lot of our good competition is also pivoting to growth. So it's not going to be a layup. We're going to have to break a sweat and differentiate ourselves. But when we think about growing, we think about bundling, auto and home. And we still need to maintain sort of the loss cost environment that -- where we see loss costs going. So all I would say is I think it's balanced. I'm pleased where we're at. Melinda, I don't know if you would add any additional color.\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nChris, I think that's all accurate. And I would just add that in addition to the new business efforts and the competitive environment we're experiencing there, retention certainly is another dynamic influencing growth, and we still have double-digit renewal price change being felt by our customers. So as that drops into single digits in the fourth quarter and continues to moderate in '26, that will help alleviate pressure on the retention and top line dynamics.\n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nAnd then Andrew, it's Beth. The only other thing that I would just add is, when we talk about being at an underlying combined ratio in auto of 95%, that would be for the full year. And I just want to remind you, again, that we see seasonality in our auto results under normal conditions where it increases roughly 2 to 3 points over the course of the year. So it's not as if every quarter would be at 95%, we'd expect the first half of the year to be lower in the second half of the year to be higher when we think about that in total."

And I guess there's been a lot of growing chatter around increasing price competition. Maybe it's not as relevant in the small market, but maybe you can talk about some pressure points you're seeing on price, maybe from your distribution partners as it relates to the Middle & Large business or maybe it's even sitting inside the Global Specialty.\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes, Greg, thanks for joining us. You're right. The 7.3% we called out this quarter is ex workers' comp in our, I'll call it, standard insurance businesses. If you're interested, I would say, in Small business, ex comp, it's 9.3%, Middle & Large ex comp, 7.3%, and roughly, that's down 1-point-or-so from prior quarters sequentially. And some of that is to be expected, just given the overall performance of certain lines, particularly led by property. But I would say, and I'm going to ask Mo to add his color, is that the real discipline that we have, and it is still needed, is there anything liability related. You could think in commercial auto. You could think of primary GL excess umbrella. And I think I gave you some of those rates. But overall, from a GL basis, we're in high single digits. Excess in umbrellas low double digits, a little bit of a sequential drop, but still double digits and commercial auto is holding up in that 10% range. So I think those are the highlights that I would just point out to you and ask Mo to add his color.\n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nGreg, I'd just say that we still feel like the market is pretty fairly priced really and especially in the smaller end of our -- of each of our books, and that will be small, middle and the global books. And I think it's also really important to make sure that you understand our starting point. We have not been fixing anything here for 2 or 3 years. And we know that -- again, when we look at some of our peers, there's some higher rate action coming through, but I think that's relative to their starting point over the past couple of years. And so I just -- I feel confident in our ability to grow. We've given tools to the underwriters that I think are market leading, the data science, the actuarial tools. So -- and I think the underwriters are really executing well in each of the BI segments. And we've given leaders, I think, booked management tools that, again, I think are second to none in the industry. So I think all in all, we're executing really well. Just to your point on where we've seen competition. I think we've talked to you before about the public D&O market. I think we've proven that when the margins aren't there, we'll pull back. I think we've been patient on workers' comp just trying to pick our spots there, knowing that market has been competitive, but the returns are good. And the most recent example, Greg, that I'll point to is our large property book in Middle & Large that segment. We've been pulling back just especially on some of the larger accounts in that segment, we've seen the market really get hungry for the large premium in that segment. And then the only other thing I'll call out for you is we are watching the London market closely. The rate movement in the quarter was something that we kept our eye on. And I think we'll pick our spots internationally as well.\n\nCharles Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):\nThanks for that additional color, Mo. I'm going to pivot to my favorite topic that I'd like to ask you guys about from time to time, which is technology. During the third quarter, a couple of your peers came out with statements about the potential benefits of technology whether it's in production or in cost savings through headcount reduction. And it's certainly consuming a lot of oxygen in the industry. So I'd like to go back and maybe -- can you give us a sense of how your tech budget looks for the upcoming year? And maybe how you're allocating it to sustaining legacy systems versus new initiatives to sort of give us a state of the union on your tech outlook?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. Happy to provide that, Greg. I would say to your first point on sort of the impacts here. I think we're early on in this baseball game. I don't know if it will be an 18-inning baseball game for those of you that watched it last night. But it's early. And I think for us, our guiding principles on any technology, whether you want to call it a data science or artificial intelligence or general intelligence is really to sort of augment our human talent, not necessarily to replace it. And ultimately, what the objective is, is to create a more frictionless experience for our customers, for our agents and brokers where we can be fast, accurate and really differentiate ourselves on a just the ease of business. I think when that happens, I think we'll -- retention will go up. I think we'll attract more business, capture more market share as we've been saying. So that's the first premise. And the premise of where we ought to go from a process side is generally 3 major areas: claims, underwriting and operations. And so that's what we're focused on. It's -- we're trying to go as fast as we can. We've allocated substantial resources to looking at our processes and fundamentally improving them, redesigning them with sort of a tech AI focus from the get-go. So that's what I would say from an outlook side, what we're trying to do, just to give you numbers, we run basically $1.3 billion all-in IT run in an invest budget. And I would say a little over $500 million is sort of the invest side of that. And its various projects, some that you might be interested in. We're still taking all our data and applications to the cloud, which we're in our fourth year of a 6-year journey to get that done. We are rolling out some pretty cool stuff, particularly in the call center activity. We're rolling out AWS Connect, which everyone in the organization, all product lines, all service centers will use. We expect that to be completed in the first half of '26. And the list can go on. But I do want to try to refrain from giving too much detail because some of this is proprietary. It's competitive. We're trying to get a first-mover advantage. And I know you'll respect that philosophy that I have. But Beth, what would you add from...\n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. The only thing I would add, and maybe just to point out the language that you used, Greg, when you said, how much do you spend on legacy business -- legacy systems versus invest. And Chris gave you the breakout between run and invest. But I wouldn't have you think that, that run is all about legacy systems. We've been on a path for several years now of modernizing our core platforms. So those run costs are related to more modern systems, which really sets us up very well to be able to spend the dollars that we're talking about from the invest side to make the strides that Chris talked about. So I just wanted to just clarify that a little bit when you think about our platforms and what we've been doing over the last 10 years.\n\nCharles Peters - Analyst (Raymond James):"

And as you're kind of getting into 4Q and you're starting to lap some of the bigger rate increases, are you seeing shopping rates come down at all for the policies where you're not taking as much price. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much is that being driven by the rate you're taking versus maybe the environment also still kind of just getting competitive with price decreases in some pockets and particularly direct-to-consumer and so forth.\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. Alex, I'll let Melinda add her color, but I would say shopping is still elevated across -- just across the business, whether it be auto or home. I think people have been somewhat conditioned to shop, and obviously, digital makes it a lot easier. You saw our price increases in auto this quarter. I would say, as we -- you get into the fourth quarter and early '26, I think by the fourth quarter, those loss -- or those pricing numbers will probably drop into the high single -- single digits, and we'll continue then to moderate in early '26 and throughout which gives us, again, the opportunity to be competitive and try to grow our PIF count. But Melinda, what would you add?\n\nMelinda Thompson - Head of Personal Lines (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nThank you, Chris. No, I don't think that shopping behavior in our book is any different than the broader industry. And I would say switching behavior has been higher driven by the multiple cycles of rate that, again, the industry has put in not anything specific to the Hartford. But I would point out, our retention is stable, and we're certainly reflective of the environment. And we implemented a number of initiatives to really focus on policyholder education and experiences, things to help them think about coverage counseling adjustments that they can make, billing reminders and other assistance. So we do a lot to try to create seamless experiences and a lot of connection with our customer as we navigate this period of time with more accelerated switching behavior.\n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nHelpful. Next thing I wanted to touch on was the capital position of the company. And I was just interested in the bigger increase in the common dividend in particular. And I wanted to get your thinking around what gives you the confidence on that. What are you seeing in the business? Is it the growth environment is slowing, or do you feel like kind of the capital position is strong enough that you can sort of do both in terms of increasing your capital distributions while still continuing to get kind of growth to get this quarter?\n\nBeth Bombara - Chief Financial Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes, Alex, I'll take that. And it really is about the fundamentals we see in our businesses and the earnings power that we have. We've been very focused through the years and looking to maintain a competitive dividend. And when we look at where our earnings growth has been, we felt very comfortable increasing it by the 15%. And I -- again, I think it just speaks to the strength of our underlying businesses. It still provides us plenty of opportunity to continue to invest for growth. So I wouldn't look at the change as any sort of signal and change in focus, and how we think about the prospects for our underlying businesses."

And then is there any expectation that you'll see an impact going forward, right, when you point -- is that embedded within your expectation that you guys are now back at target margins?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nI would say a very negligible this quarter and really for the whole year, I think as we discussed in prior calls, Elyse, and then as we turn the clock into 2026, we'll make the appropriate trend picks for our loss costs, giving due credence to any tariff pressure, particularly in property or physical damage coverages. But at this point, I don't think they'll be significant. And I think we will know how to make the appropriate estimates and judgments. So I don't think there's anything unusual here. Just another factor that we'll have to consider in our loss trends.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my follow-up was also on capital, but I guess on the different side. Buyback, right, has been kind of within this $400 million quarterly level, right, for more than a year. As you know, earnings growth are strong and the capital levels are strong at the company, what would you need to see, I guess, to increase from that $400 million baseline? And would that be, I guess, when do you think through that? Is that with the capital plan when you'll update us next quarter for next year potentially just coming off the $400 million?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. Elyse, I'll let Beth add her perspective. And you've heard us talk before, we like to be steady, predictable, and yes, any changes, we would have to contemplate. But I feel good about really what we're doing with our excess capital that we're generating, our companies are well capitalized, obviously, recognized by Moody's and S&P. We're funding meaningful growth, which we want to continue to do. Again, with the right margins, with the right mindset on profitable growth and then you see our healthy dividend that Beth commented upon. And you put it all together, it's still a good use of excess capital. And if we change the numbers or amounts, we'll let you know when we make those decisions. But we haven't made any of those decisions."

Not sure if I'm thinking about that right, but just some commentary, I guess, on the underlying combined ratio deterioration there.\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nRyan, if you're looking at sort of sequential, I would just call out, we had a strong national accounts quarter that put some pressure on the booking ratio there tends to be a little higher just given it's a long duration. And I don't know if it was any favorable or is there any property impact, no, I'm looking at you. But yes, I would just call out the national account mix that we had a strong quarter in national accounts.\n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes, there's some slight favorability in property, but it was pretty minor overall non-CAT property.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Cantor Fitzgerald):\nOkay. And then I guess just in group disability, sound like there's some paid family comp stuff. But I'm just curious if any new trends worth pointing out there?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nWell, the trends in sort of just the lead product in totality, paid family or medical, I think, are encouraging. People want these products I think it's a fairly straightforward product to sort of price and understand. We've -- after we've seen people use them just a little bit more, and that's why we're making some of the profit actions and pricing actions that we're taking there. But it's a fast-cycling business, generally 1- or 2-year rate guarantee. So we think we could be reactive. And that book is a little over $500 million for us today, Mike Fish. And so I don't know if you would call anything out on leave, but I think the main difference was what we talked about in the quarter for LTD was the basis study that we did last year that didn't reoccur. And generally, LTD is behaving. Maybe we saw a little tick up in severity this quarter. So the people that went out on LTD tend to be a little more higher salaried folks. But that can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, so -- but Mike, what would you add?\n\nMichael Fish - Head of Group Benefits (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes, Chris, I think I'd just maybe add a couple of points. I think on the leave side, as you noted, we're seeing some increase in utilization of those benefits. So we're pricing that in both when cases come up for renewal as well as our new business price pick. So again, we'll continue to do that. And we do expect utilization to level out probably in the next couple of years. But again, as employees see the value of those benefits, we're making sure we're including that increased utilization in our premium rates. And then, Chris, as you noted on the overall long-term disability book of business, we're very pleased with the performance there. So again, even though loss ratio up a bit quarter-over-quarter. I'd say, in total, we're still performing well within pricing expectations. Just we saw some very -- and we've talked about this in past quarters, some very favorable incidence trends back last year and prior in '23. So I'd almost characterize it as a bit more of a normalization as we expected to see in the loss ratio this year."

If you could elaborate, that would be great. And just related, I'm curious is there -- if you look at the last 3-, 4-, 5-year trend, I think it's fair to assume that some players, maybe just you all, you can correct me, have taken a lot of market share there. Is there a level of market share in small commercial where you start to see some kind of friction where you just have a good issue just too much market share with some of your agency partners.\n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes, our market share today, Mike, is less than 5% in the Small business space. So I don't think we felt that in any way so far. But to give you a little bit more context on what we're feeling, the -- I think coming out of CIAB, that Chris referenced in October, earlier this month, there was some really terrific feedback just about -- again, the continued themes of how good our technology is. How much time it saves relative to our competitors. Also once a small business placement is with us, our appetite has been consistent for years. So we're not pushing it back into the market. As there's been some disruption in that space, so there's a consistency of appetite that again keeps an agent from having to touch that policy again. I think we get feedback on the service capabilities that we built. We actually take time out of the agency's office, and we do that servicing for them so that we're saving them a couple of dollars on every policy. So I can keep going here. But I think broadly, our digital, our service, our placement capabilities in Small and the feedback that we get, just -- it's a better experience all around. So we expect to be able to continue to grow at a reasonable pace in that small business space and to take market share.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. And my follow-up is more high level on the pricing power levels in small to mid-commercial. I guess the increasing questions we get, I'm sure you get to is where will pricing go? It seems to be a consensus that pricing will continue to decelerate. Would you say folks in our seat might be focusing a bit too much on the ROE of the industry being healthy, whereas loss cost trend appears to be much more elevated than it has historically. Any kind of insights you'd want to add into how we should think about kind of the forward trajectory, what's impacting pricing?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. I would say, Mike, again, honestly, selfishly, I mean I think the industry ROEs are good, are healthy. But if you look at other financial services companies, I mean, they generate really, really high ROEs compared to us. You look at banks or others that participate in that side of the business. I mean, our business is one of taking risk. We're taking long-term risk. We have a lot of variability in our loss cost trends. So there's margins and prudence that we try to price into our products. So you put it all together, I think we're earning a fair return and as you've heard us, Mo and I talk along with Beth, I mean, we're trying to maintain these margins and keep up with loss cost trends. And that sounds simple. I know it's hard to do in a competitive environment. But if we could do that and compound that over a longer period of time, that's a win for our shareholders. So do I feel like you're focused on the wrong things? No, I think you're focused on the right question on trend and growth and sort of that balancing equation. But as Mo just said, it all depends where you start, right? And if you have lines like workers' comp, where -- are producing good returns and results just because you're getting a lower price increase there. That's not necessarily a bad thing because that's a product that everyone needs. It's a lead product that we use then to account round and sell other products. So it's all part of the equation of pricing your products individually, but also keeping an eye on accounts, and what you're trying to do for agents, brokers and customers."

I think the overall point though, I'll just emphasize it again, particularly ex comp. We feel like we're on top of loss cost trends as we sit here today, and we'll try to maintain that on top position going forward. There's nothing really new in comp. Particularly on severity trends are behaving at least compared to our assumptions. So I don't think there's a new piece of data that we could share with you that we haven't already talked about. But Mo or Beth, would you add anything?\n\nAdin Tooker - Head of Business Insurance (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nNo, I would just say the trends are relatively stable. And I think what we're -- especially on the liability line, so think anything GL, anything auto, the teams are keeping rates above loss cost, and I think that's going to be continue for some time. We are really pushing hard to make sure that we don't fall behind on those lines, knowing how the trend has been elevated over the past couple of years, and we intend to stay ahead of that.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay. Perfect. And just as a follow-up, I was just curious on the component of your 5.2% all-in pricing or 7.3% ex comp, the exposure-related portion of that. How has that been trending versus the pure renewal rate? Are you guys still getting a solid contribution there from the exposure component?\n\nChristopher Swift - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (The Hartford Insurance Group):\nYes. The quarter, I would call it at 1.8%, and it's been sort of consistent of 75% rate and 25% exposure as we break that down. So just to be clear, that's at the 7.3% ex comp rate that I quoted before."

With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dino Robusto.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you Ralitza, and good morning all.  Before I begin my remarks on the quarter, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tom Motamed to our organization. As you all know, Tom passed away on April 18, leaving behind an incredible legacy in our industry, which he served with distinction for 45 years. Tom was truly an insurance man through and through, climbing the ranks at Chubb for over 30 years and then joining CNA as Chairman and CEO in 2009. His myriad contributions and effective leadership helped define CNA\u2019s capabilities and reputation. Our entire organization is saddened by Tom\u2019s passing and we will always be grateful for his commitment to not only CNA but to our entire industry. In the first quarter, CNA produced very strong results with excellent profitability and double-digit top line growth from significant new business success, continued high retention, and a rebound in rate change from the fourth quarter of last year. Core income increased by $27 million in the first quarter to $325 million. Net investment income of $525 million pre-tax increased $77 million year-over-year, and our pre-tax P&C underlying underwriting gain was up 19% to a record $197 million in the quarter. Against a backdrop of elevated industry catastrophe losses in the first quarter, the all-in combined ratio was very strong at 93.9% with pre-tax catastrophe losses of $52 million, or 2.4 points of the combined ratio, which is well below our 10-year first quarter average of 3.1 points, which we believe is strongly reflective of our prudent management of catastrophe exposures. Prior period development for P&C overall was slightly unfavorable by 0.7 points on the combined ratio from adverse development on a professional liability segment we exited several years ago as part of our re-underwriting actions in our London portfolio.  The P&C underlying combined ratio was 90.8 and is 0.6 points lower than the first quarter of last year. The underlying loss ratio in the first quarter of this year was 59.8%, down 0.3 points year-over-year, and the expense ratio of 30.7% was also down 0.3 points.  In the quarter, we achieved a very strong production performance with 11% growth in both gross written premium ex-captives and net written premium. Excluding currency fluctuations, the growth was 12% for both metrics and was particularly strong in our commercial and international segments.  Written rate increase was 5% in the quarter, up a point compared to the fourth quarter with acceleration in commercial, where rates were up 2 points to 7%, and commercial rates were up a full 3 points compared to the third quarter of last year. These higher levels of written rate will favorably impact earned rate throughout the year. Pricing remains rational, increasing where we need it most, and the overall renewal premium change remains strong at slightly more than 7%. Importantly, rate change and the portion of exposure change that acts like rate continues to cover our long run loss cost trends, which are up a few tenths of a point this quarter at close to 6.5%.  New business was up 12% for the quarter to $503 million. The new business was particularly elevated across the board in commercial, where we capitalized on a number of opportunities in each of our target classes. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve commented on strengthening our industry verticals. We\u2019ve built strong verticals in areas such as national accounts property, national accounts casualty, construction and marine, in addition to verticals we have had for a long time, like middle market, surety, healthcare and affinity programs.  We have since built top industry expertise in those business segments and not just in underwriting, but across the value chain in areas such as claim and risk control. Moreover, the re-underwriting I\u2019ve discussed extensively in prior calls is well behind us, and so we are clearly engaged in the marketplace.  We are single-mindedly focused on growing profit dollars across our business segments and we closely track the strength of our new compared to renewal pricing and that has remained consistent, as have the stronger terms and conditions achieved during the hard market years. In the first quarter, we saw more opportunities to grow new business in commercial and international than we saw in specialty, and that of course will vary across the quarters. Retention remains high at 86% this quarter and has been at this level for four straight quarters as we seek to retain as much of the business as possible, that has generated our strong underlying combined ratios of around 91% for the last two years.  Turning to our three business units, the all-in and underlying combined ratios for specialty were each very strong at 90% in the first quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved 0.5 points to 58.4%, and the expense ratio was up by 0.5 points to 31.4%. We have limited exposure to community, regional and large banks as part of our D&O portfolio. Our banking exposures represent less than 2% of our aggregate management liability portfolio, and we continue to maintain prudent current accident year loss ratio PICs.  Gross written premium ex-captives growth for specialty was flat this quarter, and net written premium growth was up plus-2%. Growth was lower due to less new business in our transaction liability program from significantly fewer M&A opportunities in the quarter. Excluding this program, specialty gross growth was 5% in the quarter and new business pro"

      "raw_bytes": "s new business in our transaction liability program from significantly fewer M&A opportunities in the quarter. Excluding this program, specialty gross growth was 5% in the quarter and new business production in the other specialty lines of business was similar or slightly higher than the amounts we wrote in the first quarter of 2022. Within specialty, rates were plus-2 this quarter, down 1 point from the fourth quarter. Management liability experienced rate decreases of minus-3% this quarter, which is down from flat during the fourth quarter largely impacted by D&O pricing. In D&O, the softening rate environment continued this quarter, where pricing was down 3 points from the fourth quarter to minus-12%. This line of business had high double-digit cumulative rate throughout the hard market cycle, which peaked towards the end of the first quarter of 2022.  Since that point, fewer new financial opportunities combined with new entrants into the market is creating this price softening in the near term. How long it will continue depends on the claims activity, which can change pretty quickly in this line of business, as history has taught us. We continue to underwrite conservatively and we will secure the right accounts at the needed terms and conditions which clearly exist, as many clients value the proven track record associated with longstanding, stable and expert insurers as they construct their towers of coverage. Retention remains very strong at 88% for the third straight quarter, with all products in specialty achieving high retention levels.  Turning to commercial, the all-in combined ratio was 96%, which includes 4.2 points of cat loss in the first quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 91.8%, the lowest on record and 0.9 points lower than last year. The underlying loss ratio of 61.5% was stable year-over-year. The expense ratio improved by almost a full point to 29.8% in the quarter, representing the lowest quarterly expense ratio in 15 years.  Gross written premiums ex-captives and net written premium each grew by 19% this quarter. All business units within commercial benefited from stable to improved pricing, high retentions, and strong levels of new business. In the quarter, commercial renewal change was slight higher than 9%. Rates were up plus-7% in commercial, up 2 points from the fourth quarter driven by acceleration in property rates, wherein our national accounts property portfolio rate was above 25%. Price increases continued to climb through the quarter from the levels in January that I commented on during our fourth quarter call. Our middle market property accounts had rate increases in the high single digits, which is a great result given the multi-line nature of middle market package business, just a different competitive dynamic than larger mono-line property business. Looking forward, we do not see any signs of significant change in the marketplace; in fact, in some areas of national accounts property, we see rates accelerating beyond the high 20s level we are experiencing today.  Outside of rate, we continue to capitalize on improved terms and conditions, which as we described to you last quarter have a significant positive impact on controlling our catastrophe exposure. We also remain extremely focused on securing appropriate insurance to value during these inflationary times, and valuation increases in national accounts property were high single digits in the first quarter. As you know, our major property reinsurance treaties renew on June 1. Although still a little early, our sentiment remains in line with what we said in the fourth quarter - we have had good results in our property business, which has also benefited our reinsurers, and the first quarter of this year reveals again our prudent management of cat, and we expect all of that to help us at renewal. We expect to maintain a strong program in line with what we\u2019ve had over the last several years, and while we anticipate securing the program at higher prices, we nonetheless expect pricing to reflect our strong performance and underwriting expertise. Outside of property, commercial auto rates also improved by more than a point in the first quarter to slightly above 9%, and were even higher in the month of March. Excess casualty rates were mid single digits and renewal premium change was over 8% for the quarter, keeping pace with long run loss cost trends in this line. Rates moved higher throughout the quarter and that trend continued in April, which is encouraging as it is needed in light of the impact industry nuclear verdicts have on this line. As we have highlighted in the past, we also have brought down our limits profile over the last several years in response to the social inflationary pressure, and that has benefited the performance of this portfolio as well. Primarily, general liability renewal premium change was mid single digit in the quarter and also moved higher in April. Work comp pricing continued to be slightly negative, and in the quarter overall commercial pricing, excluding work comp, rates were up 9% and renewal premium change was up 11%, which continues to be well above our long run loss cost trend.  Commercial retention remains strong at 86% and was strong in all business units. New business was up 36% and also strong across all business areas, as I mentioned earlier. Given the firming rates in commercial lines and our well established and specialized business verticals, we anticipate quality new business opportunities to persist. For international, the all-in combined ratio was 97.2% and the underlying combined ratio was 89.3%, a record low. International had strong top line this quarter with gross written premiums up 10%, or 17% excluding currency fluctuation. Net written premiums grew 8%, or 16% excluding currency fluctuation. Renewal premium change was 8% in the quarter with both rate and exposure increase up 4%. Retention was strong in international at 82% for the quarter and has been at or above this level for four straight quarters. New business was up 9% in the quarter and 15% excluding currency fluctuations. Our international operation is now consistently growing and producing meaningful profitability for CNA overall.  With that, I will turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you Dino, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional information on our results, as Dino indicated. Core income of $325 million is up 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, leading to core return on equity of 10.8%, while our P&C segment had record pre-tax underlying underwriting income of $197 million. Turning to investments, total pre-tax net investment income increased 17% to $525 million in the first quarter. The increase was driven by our fixed income in other investment portfolios, which were $57 million favorable to the prior year quarter, while our limited partnership and common stock results returned a $28 million gain in the current quarter compared to an $8 million gain in the prior year quarter.  Our fixed income portfolio continues to produce consistent net investment income which has been steadily increasing over the last year as a result of favorable reinvestment rates in our P&C portfolios, as well as a growing investment base funded by strong cash flow from operations. Within our P&C and corporate segment portfolios, the average fixed income effective income yield was 4% in the first quarter compared to 3.6% in the prior year quarter.  As of the end of the first quarter, reinvestment rates were well above our P&C effective income yield while our life and group portfolio effective income yield was flat in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter, as this portfolio is longer duration and has embedded yields more comparable to today\u2019s interest rate environment.

Additionally, within the other category investment income, which includes short term investments, we are benefiting from significantly higher short term rates as compared to a year ago.  We believe our investment portfolio to be both high quality and well diversified. Our fixed income portfolio, which makes up 90% of our total investments, has a weighted average credit rating of A and is made up of 95% investment-grade securities. While we maintain an allocation to risk assets, including limited partnerships, common stocks and below investment grade securities, we believe it is positioned conservatively and well within our risk appetite. Additionally, we maintain ample liquidity to meet obligations and withstand significant business variability at both the holding and operating company levels.  Given the recent focus on the commercial real estate sector, we have included supplemental disclosure of our exposure in our earnings presentation, financial supplement, and our first quarter Form 10-Q that will be filed later this morning. Our direct exposure to commercial real estate is through fixed income securities in the form of commercial mortgage-backed securities and issuer obligations of real estate investment trusts, as well as through our direct mortgage loan portfolio. Together, these three portfolios comprise about 9% of our total investment portfolio.  Our commercial real estate holdings are high quality and well diversified as to underlying property type and geography. Taken together, our CMBS and REIT portfolios are 95% investment grade with 50% rated A or higher. Finally, we are limited in exposure to commercial real estate in our limited partnership portfolio as this is not one of our core alternative strategies.  Prior to discussing life and group results, I\u2019d like to discuss our adoption of the change in GAAP accounting methodology related to long duration targeted improvements, otherwise known as LDTI. That now applies to our long term care business. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method applied as of the transition date of January 1, 2021. Our 2023 first quarter results include adjusted financial results for Q1 2022, reflecting LDTI accounting.  As this is the first period under LDTI, there are adjusted financial statements for each of the 2022 quarters as well as full years 2022 and 2021, that could be found in our first quarter financial supplement as well as transition-specific disclosures reconciling previously published financial data in our Form 10-Q to be filed later this morning. Measured as of December 31, 2022, the impact of LDTI to stockholders equity was a $277 million decrease, which was comprised of a $236 million decrease to retained earnings and a $41 million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income.  As we have noted in prior calls, I\u2019d like to emphasize this change in accounting has no impact to the underlying economics of CNA\u2019s business; however, the cumulative effective assumption differences and differences in reserving methodologies will have an impact on the pattern of GAAP earnings emergence over time, and as we have many policy groups with a net premium ratio capped at 100%, we also expect a certain amount of quarter-to-quarter volatility. As such, over the next several years, we expect a modestly higher underwriting loss under LDTI as compared with legacy GAAP. As to life and group\u2019s first quarter results, we had a core loss of $3 million as compared to a $5 million core income result for last year\u2019s first quarter. Investment income was about flat with the prior year while the underwriting loss was higher by $10 million pre-tax, which reflected the impact of $55 million of cash policy buy-outs during the quarter. Looking forward, we expect to continue offering policy buy-outs in connection with rate increase activity, although the effect on life and group\u2019s earnings will vary quarter to quarter. Our first quarter P&C expense ratio was 30.7%, which is a slight decrease when compared to last year\u2019s first quarter expense ratio of 31%. At the segment level, both commercial and international saw improvements in their expense ratios compared to prior, primarily driven by strong growth in net earned premium. For specialty, the expense ratio increased by half a point due to employee-related costs that included higher legacy pension plan expense. As I have noted in prior calls, there will be a certain amount of variability quarter to quarter, and we do expect a somewhat higher expense ratio in the second quarter as employee compensation market adjustments take effect; however, we continue to believe an expense ratio of 31% is a reasonable run rate for 2023.  As Dino noted earlier, P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 0.7 points unfavorable in the current quarter, which is coming out of our international segment, while specialty and commercial were both flat. The P&C paid to incurred ratio was 0.81 in the first quarter. This is down slightly from the fourth quarter and consistent with the first quarter of 2022. The ratio, which fluctuates quarter to quarter, has been consistently lower over the past three years. Our corporate segment produced a core loss of $18 million in the first quarter compared to a $28 million loss in Q1 2022. As we have noted in prior calls, we perform our annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter, and all other corporate segment reserves including legacy mass tort exposures during the second quarter. At quarter end, our balance continues to be very solid with stockholders equity, excluding AOCI, of $12 billion or $44.21 per share, which is an increase of 2% from year end 2022, adjusting for dividends. Stockholders equity including AOCI was $8.7 billion or $32 per share and reflects our investment portfolio moving into less of a net unrealized loss position during the quarter, partially offset by an LDTI adjustment on reserves for future policy benefits. We continue to maintain a conservative capital structure with a leverage ratio of 19%, excluding AOCI, and our capital remains strong.  Cash flow from operations was $436 million for the first quarter, which is down from $645 million for last year\u2019s first quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower distributions from limited partnership investments and to a lesser extent higher long term care policy buy-outs I noted a moment ago. Otherwise, cash flow from P&C underwriting activities and fixed income investments remains very strong, reflecting continued excellent underwriting and fixed income results respectively. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on core income was 20% for the first quarter. As I noted in our last earnings call, we expect a similar effective tax rate for 2023 with a certain amount of variability quarter to quarter.  Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share to be paid on June 1, 2023 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2023.  With that, I will turn it back to Dino.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThanks Scott. To recap, we had an excellent start to the year with strong top and bottom line performance. Pricing resiliency persists, evidenced by the rebound in several lines of business in the quarter which I believe reflects a broader awareness that rate increases need to continue to compound for longer, given the compound effects of inflationary pressures on loss cost trends. The pricing environment should in turn allow us to maintain strong retention levels.  We are well positioned to continue to secure high quality new business in our target areas, and on the investment side the improved fixed income yields will continue to be a tailwind.  With that, we will be happy to take your questio"

It\u2019s Scott here. That\u2019s right - development was flat for both specialty and commercial for the quarter. Just a little bit more color on specialty - we had unfavorable claim settlements in old accident years in our one-off healthcare portfolio, but were offset by favorable reserve developments in other parts of our special portfolio that\u2019s resulting in the flat result.  Then as far as commercial, just some puts and takes there. Again, it\u2019s consistent with prior years, relatively flat this quarter. \n\nDerek Han - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nGot it, that\u2019s helpful. Then my second question is on cat losses. You said that first quarter was running maybe 70 BPs below the historical pace. Can you just talk about maybe the guidance or 2023 outlook in terms of cat losses for the year?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nDerek, it\u2019s Dino. We don\u2019t give out guidance, but I just wanted to highlight our conservative and prudent management, and that\u2019s why I referenced the 10-year, sort of looking it backwards, but we don\u2019t give guidance on cat.\n\nDerek Han - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nOkay, no, that makes sense. Then my last question, just on the pricing environment, DNO pricing worsened 3 points sequentially quarter-over-quarter, but is there any change in the bank DNO pricing? Just kind of curious about the impacts of the banking fallout.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYou know, when you look at it in the fourth quarter, it was negative, and then when you started to see some of the news, that started to change in the first quarter and then started to stabilize closer to flat.\n\nDerek Han - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nGot it, that\u2019s helpful.

With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dino Robusto.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Ralitza, and good morning all. In the second quarter, CNA once again produced very strong results with excellent profitability and double-digit topline growth from continued strong renewal change, retention and new business success. Core income increased by 34% in the second quarter, compared to last year with net investment income, up 33% with strong income growth in our alternatives portfolio and a continued tailwind in our fixed-income portfolio. Scott will provide more detail on investments. The P&C all-in combined ratio was strong at 93.8% with pretax catastrophe losses of $68 million more 3.1 points of the combined ratio and 0.4 points of favorable prior-period development. The underlying combined ratio was 91.1%, generating a record $200 million of pre-tax, P&C underlying underwriting gain. The underlying loss ratio was 59.9% slightly less than the same period last year and the expense ratio was 30.9%, up four-tenths of a point, compared to last year, primarily due to higher pension expense. In the quarter, we achieved a very strong production performance with 12% growth in gross written premiums ex-captives and 9% growth in net written premium. Excluding currency fluctuation, gross growth was 12% and net growth was 10% led by our commercial and international segments this quarter. Renewal premium change was stable at 7%, but accelerated 2 points in commercial to 11%. Importantly, rate change and the portion of exposure change that acts like rate continues to cover our long-run loss cost trends which were unchanged at this quarter at roughly 6.5%. New business was up 11% in the quarter in-line with the growth in the first quarter and with the most significant opportunities continuing to be across our commercial business units. We continue to closely track, the strength of our pricing on new and renewal business and that has remained consistent as have the stronger terms and conditions achieved during the hard market years. We continue to lock in the hard market improvements in pricing and terms and conditions with consistently high retention levels, which in the second quarter for P&C overall was 86%. And it has been at that level for five straight quarters. Turning to our three business units. The all-in combined ratio was 90.9% for specialty this quarter, which includes 0.3 points of favorable prior-period development. The underlying combined ratio was 91.2% with an underlying loss ratio of 58.6%, which is stable, compared to last year. Well, the expense ratio in specialty was up by 2 points to 32.4%. The increase in the expense ratio is partially due to the lower net earned premium growth. And as usual, Scott will provide more detail on expenses. Gross written premiums ex-captives growth and net written premium growth for specialty were each down minus 1% this quarter. New business was down 9%. While most of the decrease was driven by the protracted decline in M&A opportunities affecting our transaction liability book, we are also being prudent in management liability lines given the competitive landscape. Within Specialty, written rate change was minus 1% in the quarter, driven by continued competitive pressure on management liability [Technical Difficulty]. Cumulative rate movement across these lines since mid-2018 through the hard market years and inclusive of the declines in the first-half of 2023 is plus 61%, which continues to favorably impact the overall strong profitability of the portfolio. In the other specialty segment, rate increases persists. Our Affinity Programs have much less pricing volatility overtime and continue to produce stable rate increases in the low to mid-single-digits. Our healthcare business has undergone tremendous re-underwriting in addition to significant improvement in pricing, as well as terms and conditions that we pushed through the portfolio over the last five years. We highlighted these changes quite regularly on prior calls and pointed out that our healthcare portfolio is now smaller, but profitable. Of course, we remain vigilant in pursuing additional rate increases. And in the second quarter, rates were up mid-single-digit for healthcare. Retention in specialty remains strong improving by 1 point to 89% in the aggregate, and is up in each of the three business areas. Turning to Commercial. The all-in combined ratio was 96.3%, which includes 5.2 points of cat loss in the second quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 91.6%, 0.4 points lower than last year and the lowest on record. The underlying loss ratio of 61.5% was stable year-over-year. The expense ratio improved four-tenths of a point to 29.6% in the quarter, representing the lowest quarterly expense ratio in 15-years. Gross written premium ex-captives grew by 21% this quarter and net written premium grew by 17% this quarter. Renewal premium change was 11% in the quarter, up 2 points from the first quarter and is close to the hard market high of 12% we achieved in early 2021. Excluding work comp, the renewal premium change was plus 13% in the second quarter actually similar to the high watermark we achieved early 2021. The commercial written rate change in the second quarter of plus 8% continues to accelerate and reflects double the level it was in the third quarter of last year. Commercial rate increases excluding work comp were up plus 10% in the second quarter. Importantly, the increase in the rate change was broad-based across business units and line of business. In middle market, rate was plus 6% and renewal premium change was plus 8%, each up 2 points from last quarter. Construction rate was plus 6%, up 1 point from last quarter and renewal premium change was plus 10%. In National Accounts, rate was plus "

In National Accounts, rate was plus 20%, compared to plus 17% last quarter. Looking by line, commercial auto rates were low-double-digit in the quarter, 2 points higher than the last quarter. Rates for excess casualty have also accelerated over the past year and are now high-single-digits. Primary liability rates are up in the mid-single digits, also representing an increase from last quarter. We believe it is rational that rates in casualty lines inflected and continue to increase since bottoming out in the third quarter of 2022, because as we have said, social inflation had only been obfuscated during the pandemic. And although loss cost trends remained essentially stable in the second quarter, it is an annual compounding cost and it's appropriate that rates increase for longer. Work comp rates continue to be flat to slightly negative, but renewal price change remains quite strong, about mid-single-digit as we are benefiting from exposure increases as payrolls rise, and medical trends continue to be below our long-run loss cost trend assumptions, which we have not lowered despite the favorable trends over the last several years. Property continued to achieve significant rate increases this quarter. In our national accounts area, property rates are up in the 25% to 30% range. In addition, we continue to achieve increases in valuation averaging mid-single-digit and non-rate terms and conditions also remain strong. In our middle market space, property rates are now low-double-digits, up 4 points from last quarter, and we continue to see insurance value increases here as well. We renewed all of our property reinsurance treaties June 1st. We were successful in maintaining all coverages and covered payrolls in all our treaties and layers. There were very minimal increases in attachment points. On our corporate cat treaty, the attachment increased a little less than $50 million, but remains still lower than the $250 million it had been historically. While costs increased overall as anticipated, the increases were in line with our good performance and prudent management of our cat exposure over the last several years. And with a very favorable price and valuation increases, we expect to continue to achieve across our property portfolio, we don't anticipate margins to be impacted. Commercial retention remained strong at 85% and was strong in all business units. New business was up 23%, with excellent opportunities spread across all our commercial business units. We have been effectively leveraging the favorable property market conditions and growing our property portfolio without significantly increasing our P&L. While we are writing cat and non-cat property new business, we are also optimizing our renewal book by changing layers and exposures leading to a better risk-adjusted returns than we had at expiry on certain renewals. And we're also letting accounts go where we can't achieve the improved pricing and terms and conditions available today. We also saw some great opportunities in the E&S channel for National Accounts. Now it's still a relatively small portfolio, but providing excellent opportunities. For international, the all-in combined ratio was 92.2%, and the underlying combined ratio was 89.1%, a record low. International had strong top line growth this quarter with gross written premiums up 10% or 12%, excluding currency fluctuation. Net written premiums grew 9% or 10%, excluding currency fluctuation. Renewal premium change was 7% with written rate change of 4%, consistent with last quarter. We see many analogous trends to the U.S. in our Continental European and London portfolios with continuing hardening of property rates and rate decreases on management liability classes. Retention was strong in international at 83% for the quarter and has been stable at this higher level for more than a year. New business was up by 5% in the quarter. Our international operation continues to contribute positive top and bottom line results to CNA. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Dino, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional information on our results, as Dino indicated. Core income of $308 million is up 34%, compared to the second quarter of last year, leading to a core return on equity of 10.2%, while our P&C segment had record pretax underlying underwriting income of $200 million, and core income of $374 million. Our second quarter P&C expense ratio was 30.9%, which is a slight increase when compared to last year's second quarter expense ratio of 30.5%, due to higher legacy U.S. pension plan expense, reflecting financial market conditions at the time of valuation in late 2022. At the segment level, both Commercial and International saw improvements in their expense ratios, compared to prior primarily driven by strong growth in net earned premium. For Specialty, as Dino just noted, the expense ratio increased due to lower net earned premium growth, higher employee-related costs, including higher pension expense, as well as higher acquisition expense, partially due to mix of business in the quarter. As I have noted in prior calls, there will be a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to believe an expense ratio of 31% is a reasonable run rate for 2023. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was favorable by 0.4 points. In the Specialty segment, favorable development was driven by surety. And in the commercial segment, favorable development in workers\u2019 compensation was partially offset by unfavorable development in general liability in auto. The P&C paid-to-incurred ratio was 0.83 in the second quarter, which is about flat with the first quarter of this year and is broadly consistent with the second quarter of 2022. The ratio, which fluctuates quarter-to-quarter has been consistently lower over the past three years. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $46 million in the second quarter, compared to a $78 million loss in the prior year quarter. We conduct a comprehensive review of mass tort reserves in the second quarter of each year, and we also react to facts and circumstances in the interim quarters. As a result of this quarter's review, the segment includes a $28 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort claims. As a reminder, our asbestos and environmental reserves are reviewed every fourth quarter. As to Life & Group second quarter results, we had a core loss of $20 million, as compared to a $9 million core loss for last year's second quarter. Investment income was up $28 million pretax, compared to the prior year, mostly driven by limited partnership performance, while the underwriting loss reflects a $13 million pretax loss related to the impact of $67 million of cash policy buyouts during the quarter. For year-to-date, Life & Group core loss was $23 million, compared to a core loss of $4 million in the prior year-to-date period. Year-to-date, Life & Group results reflect $30 million in higher pretax investment income, as well as a $26 million pretax loss related to $121 million of cash policy buyouts. Excluding policy buyouts, Life & Group year-to-date underwriting results are broadly in line with reserve expectations. As I noted last quarter, as an integral component of our risk mitigation strategy, we expect to continue offering policy buyouts as part of approved rate increases for the rest of 2023 and future years. GAAP losses are expected on the buyout program, given the cash offers are linked to higher statutory reserve levels. In the near-term, we expect policy buyouts could generate quarterly GAAP losses up to $10 million pretax depend"

In the near-term, we expect policy buyouts could generate quarterly GAAP losses up to $10 million pretax depending on the respective policy or cohort and the actual acceptance rates of such offers. Looking to future years, we expect such buyouts will continue to impact underwriting results with a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. Also, as I noted last quarter, our LTC business is now accounted for under LDTI, which we adopted as of January 1, 2023, and prior period results were adjusted to reflect LDTI. A reminder that LDTI has no effect on the underlying economics of CAN\u2019s business. However, we expect a modestly higher underwriting loss under LDTI over the next several years, as compared to legacy GAAP, putting aside any assumption changes arising from our annual third quarter assumption review. You can find a reconciliation of our 2022 quarterly results adjusted for LDTI and as reconciled to legacy GAAP in our first quarter financial supplement, as well as our first quarter Form 10-Q. Turning to investments. Total pretax net investment income increased 33% to $575 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by our limited partnership and common stock portfolios, which returned $68 million -- which returned a $68 million gain in the second quarter, compared to a $15 million loss in the prior year quarter. The second quarter gain reflects positive contributions across strategies and a favorable equity market environment, while the prior year quarter includes losses from our hedge fund and common stock portfolios and we're in line with unfavorable equity market performance at that time. Additionally, our fixed income and other investment portfolios were $60 million, favorable to the prior year quarter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to produce consistent income, which has been steadily increasing over the last year as a result of favorable reinvestment rates in our P&C portfolios, as well as a growing investment base funded by strong cash flow from operations. Within our P&C and Corporate segment portfolios, the average effective income yield was 4.2% in the second quarter, compared to 4.0% in the first quarter of this year and 3.7% in the prior year quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, reinvestment rates were well above our P&C effective income yield. Our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield was 5.5% in the second quarter, compared to 5.4% in the prior year quarter, a more modest increase as this portfolio is longer duration and has embedded yields more comparable to today's interest rate environment. Additionally, within the other category of net investment income, which includes interest income on short-term investments and cash, we are benefiting from significantly higher short-term rates, as compared to a year ago. We believe our investment portfolio to be both high quality and well diversified. Our fixed income portfolio, which makes up 88% of our total investments has a weighted average credit rating of A, and is made up of 96% investment-grade securities. While we maintain an allocation of risk assets, including limited partnerships, common stocks and below investment-grade securities, we believe it is positioned conservatively and well within our risk appetite. Additionally, we maintain ample liquidity to meet obligations and withstand significant business variability at both the holding and operating company levels. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI of $12.2 billion or $44.86 per share, an increase of 5% from year-end 2022 adjusting for dividends. Stockholders\u2019 equity, including AOCI, was $8.7 billion or $32.22 per share. We continue to maintain a conservative capital structure with a low leverage ratio and a well-balanced debt maturity schedule. During the second quarter, we successfully issued $400 million of senior notes to help position us ahead of upcoming debt maturities in November 2023 and May 2024. Cash flow from operations was $501 million for the second quarter, which is down $608 million from last year's second quarter. The decrease in the second quarter is primarily attributable to the aforementioned long-term care policy buyouts. Otherwise, cash flow from P&C underwriting activities and fixed income investments remains very strong, reflecting continued excellent underwriting and fixed income results, respectively. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on core income was 21.6%, and reflects several adjustments related to state tax audits and our foreign operations, as well as lower tax-exempt investment income as compared to prior periods. Looking forward, we expect our full-year 2023 effective tax rate to be about 21% with a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share to be paid on August 31st, 2023, to shareholders of record on August 14, 2023. And with that, I will turn it back to Dino.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThanks, Scott. To recap, we had an excellent quarter with strong top and bottom line performance and significant improvement in net investment income. The pricing cycle continues to be varied by line, reflecting the unique dynamics impacting loss cost trends. The rate decreases in management liability is consistent with prior underwriting cycles post very large spikes during the hard market years, and the firming in all commercial lines ex-work comp is a reflection of the market need for further rate increases for longer due to the elevated cats and the compounding impacts of economic and social inflation. This improved the commercial pricing continues to flow through to our new business writings. And with our major reinsurance treaty renewals complete with no substantial changes in protection, we feel confident about our ability to continue to leverage those segments and lines of business with the most favorable overall terms and conditions in the second-half of the year and to do so while covering our long-run loss cost trends. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator - Operator (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nGood morning. I was hoping to spend a little time on a couple of lines of business within Specialty. First, I guess, I was a little surprised that as rate decreases accelerated in financial institutions and management liability, I'm sure that's E&O, but we saw a sequential uptick in retention, which went sort of the off direction. I'm hoping you could talk us through that.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes, Meyer. Hi, thanks. It's Dino. Again, this is a very profitable portfolio. And as I indicated, you know, even if you account for the increase in loss cost trends, you know, the rates today are still above a pretty hard market. And so we feel good about the portfolio, and we obviously want to lock-in good, strong terms and conditions on our renewal book. As I said, I don't think it's very inconsistent some of the rate decreases given some of the large increases you've seen over the hard market. So I think, in general, all of the underwriters are doing a good job about balancing rate and retention in the management liability lines, and we still feel very comfortable with the portfolio.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nOkay. Fair enough. Second question on medical malpractice. I guess I'm surprised that, that lines rate increases are decelerating just based on how some competitors are doing? Can you give us any insight into the Q&A specific book?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief E"

CNA's book today, Meyer, is unique, because of, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks, it's been a five-year process of remediating this portfolio. It's been a tremendous amount of re-underwriting the book is considerably smaller. We've gotten substantial cumulative rate increases, we started considerably before the broader market. And if you recall, Meyer, during those years, our retention had plummeted in the low-60s, a reflection of the fact that we were clearly swimming upstream in pursuit of the rate increases. But today, we find ourselves with a smaller portfolio. It's profitable. It's the segments of middle of medical mal that are typically more profitable, I think some of the rates reflect that, but make no mistake about it. We're going to continue to push for rates and continue to work on all of the underwriting strategies that we've had over the last five years. And I think it's fair to consider the CNA portfolio today somewhat unique.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)):\nOkay, perfect.

I know, Dino you gave some good commentary on the opening remarks from a rate perspective, but I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little bit deeper into what are the makeup of that portfolio, where you're seeing the best opportunity across National Accounts and Middle Market?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. So I think we're seeing it both in National Accounts and Middle Market. But obviously, in the National Account space, you're seeing a lot more rate increases, larger schedules. We're also seeing larger valuation increases were also some opportunities in the E&S space, which we started about a year ago, and so we're seeing some good opportunities there. It's all within our target market, nothing has really changed in what we go after. But obviously, both in the [shared] (ph) and layered and ground up, there's plenty of opportunity and capacity needs. And so as I indicated, we're growing the portfolio, but also we continue to optimize it as we get better terms and conditions even at renewal today than we did a year ago before the market really hardened at Jan 1.\n\nKyle LaBarre - Analyst (Dowling & Partners Securities):\nGreat, thanks. And then just another question on loss cost trends. I imagine they were relatively stable. You've mentioned overall loss trend relatively stable at 6.5%. But we've heard some varying trends within the medical side so far during the reporting season. Curious what you're seeing there in terms of medical cost inflation.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nWhen you look at our work comp, Kyle, medical costs are up and you got to be specific. You got to really look at the components of medical costs when you look at CPI that really impacts work comp like, for example, physician services. So -- but even with them being up somewhat, they are still well below our baked-in assumptions, which we have never lowered notwithstanding the benign trends for many years. So still very good, and we feel very good about the portfolio, and it's very profitable.\n\nKyle LaBarre - Analyst (Dowling & Partners Securities):\nPerfect. And just one more for me. And we started to see some more headlines on whether it's the forever chemicals or the lead wiring, just sort of the increase in latent liability concerns I know you've got the reserve cover in place for A&E. But maybe just sort of from a high level, curious how you're thinking about those sorts of exposures. What are the things that we should be focused on as we think through what the impact for the industry could be?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nKyle, as Scott mentioned, right, we do a ground up mass toward review in the second quarter? And then as you also indicated, I mean if there's anything specific that might transpire during the year like abuse cases, then we'll act during the quarter. And we look at all of those things and we try to capture in our reserves and mass towards the information that we have. It's obviously evolving. It's going to take time to evolve, and we'll continue to incorporate the information as it develops. There's not much else we can say at this particular juncture.\n\nKyle LaBarre - Analyst (Dowling & Partners Securities):"

I would now like to turn the call over to Ralitza Todorova, Vice President of Investor Relations and Rating Agencies for opening remarks and introduction of today\u2019s speakers. Please go ahead.\n\nRalitza Todorova - Vice President of Investor Relations and Rating Agencies (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Jason. Good morning and welcome to CNA\u2019s discussion of our third quarter 2023 financial results. Our third quarter earnings press release, presentation and financial supplement were released this morning and are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.cna.com. Speaking today will be Dino Robusto, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Lindquist, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements and references to non-GAAP financial measures. Any forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made during the call. Information concerning those risks is contained in the earnings press release and in CNA\u2019s most recent SEC filings. In addition, the forward-looking statements speak only as of today, Monday, October 30, 2023. CNA expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made during this call. Regarding non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and other information have been provided in our earnings press release, financial supplement and other filings with the SEC. This call is being recorded and webcast. A replay of the call maybe accessed on our website. If you are reading a transcript of this call, please note that the transcript may not be reviewed for accuracy, thus it may contain transcription errors that could materially alter the intent or meaning of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dino Robusto.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Ralitza and good morning, all. In the third quarter, CNA continued to produce very strong results with a significant increase in core income driven by higher investment income, record P&C underlying underwriting gain, lower levels of catastrophe loss and improved results in Life & Group. Our top line production continues to be driven by our Commercial Business segment, with broad success across our middle market, construction and national accounts units. And as discussed in prior quarters, we have continued to push for appropriate rate in those lines which have been adversely affected by social inflation. Last quarter, I specifically addressed the inflection point that we saw in excess casualty and commercial auto, where rate increases accelerated. And this quarter, that trend continued. We believe higher rates for longer are appropriate in these lines and we are pleased that there is an increasing awareness for this need in the marketplace. Drilling down on the details for the quarter, core income increased considerably in the third quarter to $289 million from $43 million in the prior year period. We conducted our annual Life & Group reserve assumption review in the quarter, resulting in an essentially neutral change in total. Last year, the reserve assumption review resulted in a loss of $143 million after tax adjusted to reflect LDTI accounting. Excluding the impacts of Life & Group reserve assumption review in both periods, core income was still up 56%. Net investment income was up 31% with positive income in our alternatives portfolio compared to a loss in the prior year quarter and a higher gain in our fixed income portfolio due to greater yield and a higher volume of invested assets. Scott will provide more detail on investments and Life & Group results. P&C core income was up 35% in the quarter, reflecting higher investment income, record pre-tax underlying underwriting gain and lower cat losses. The P&C all-in combined ratio was strong at 94.3%, with pre-tax catastrophe losses of $94 million or 4.1 points of the combined ratio compared to $114 million or 5.5 points in the third quarter last year. Our cat result in the quarter was also below our 10-year average for third quarter catastrophes. Favorable development was 0.2 points in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 90.4%, generating a record $220 million of pre-tax P&C underlying underwriting gain. The underlying loss ratio was 60% and the expense ratio was 30.1%. The P&C expense ratio benefited by 0.6 points in the quarter from a favorable reinsurance acquisition-related catch-up adjustment in International. In the quarter, we achieved 7% growth in gross written premiums ex-captive and 6% growth in net written premium. Renewal premium change in the quarter of 6% reflected a rate change of 5%, consistent with the first half of the year and included an exposure increase of 1%. Exposure change is lower than the prior quarter because of underwriting actions we took on certain accounts, leveraging the favorable hard market conditions to further improve the loss profile. As an example, we increased attachments and reduced participation on certain large national accounts. While these actions had the effect of reducing the exposure metric we report, it is masking the positive impacts of exposure increase that act like rate, which we continue to experience in the quarter. This includes mid-single-digit exposure increases in work comp and high-single-digit valuation changes in our property portfolio similar to last quarter. Rate and exposure that acts like rate is still covering our long-run loss cost trends which continue to run at about 6.5% in aggregate. Retention was 84% in the quarter, down 2 points compared to the prior quarter. And in any given quarter, there can be some fluctuation based on the mix of accounts under competition. And when we can\u2019t get the terms and conditions, we deem necessary, we\u2019ll let the account go. Year-to-date, our renewal retention is 85%, which is the same level for the first 9 months of 2022 and in line with expectations. New business was up $20 million in the quarter or 4% on and $127 million or 9% for the first 9 months of the year. Turning to our three business units. The all-in combined ratio was 90.1% for specialty this quarter, which includes 0.6 points of favorable prior-period development. The underlying combined ratio was 90.7% with an underlying loss ratio of 58.6% and the expense ratio was 31.8%. Gross written premiums, ex-captive growth was down minus 1%, similar to the second quarter, and net written premium growth was down minus 2% this quarter. New business was down 7%, and the decrease continues to be driven by the protracted decline in business opportunities we commented on over the last few quarters, such as M&A activity and our prudent approach to new business on management liability lines. Within Specialty, the rate change turned positive to plus 1% in the quarter, up 2 points compared to last quarter. FIML pricing improved 5 points driven by D&O price decreases, which moderated in the quarter, and we believe that is rational as the third quarter reflects the start of a second round of price decreases. Although encouraged by the moderation, it is too early to know if this is a hard inflection as the result in any one quarter, as I just mentioned, can be impacted by the mix of individual accounts renewing in the quarter. We were also successful in raising rates by an additional 2 points in the quarter to 7% in our healthcare med/mal business. And our affinity programs continue to produce stable rate increases in the low to mid-single digits. Retention in specialty remained very strong at 87% in the quarter and 88% on a year-to-date basis, up 2 points compared"

Retention in specialty remained very strong at 87% in the quarter and 88% on a year-to-date basis, up 2 points compared to 86% in the same 9-month period last year. Turning to Commercial. The all-in combined ratio was 98.9%, which includes 7.4 points of cat loss in the third quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 91.5%, 0.4 points lower than last year and the lowest on record. The underlying loss ratio of 61.5% was stable year-over-year and the expense ratio improved by 0.4 points to 29.5% in the quarter, representing the lowest quarterly expense ratio in 15 years. We had another strong double-digit growth quarter in Commercial. Gross written premium ex-captives grew by 13% and net written premium grew by 11% in part, fueled by continued excellent new business growth of 19% in the quarter. Renewal premium change was plus 9% in the quarter, down 2 points from the second quarter due mainly to the exposure decline from underwriting actions that I mentioned earlier. The commercial rate change was plus 8% in the quarter, comparable to the prior quarter. Casualty rates continue to improve with commercial auto rates at low-double-digit in the quarter, 1 point higher than the prior quarter. And rates for excess casualty are now double-digit, up a couple of points from last quarter. Property pricing continues to be very strong. In national accounts, rate increases in the quarter were in the mid-20s and middle-market property rate increases are at their highest levels during this hard market at low double-digit levels. Work comp rates were a couple of points lower than the prior quarter, a continuation of the quarterly fluctuation we have seen in the pricing between slightly positive and slightly negative over the last 3 years. Additionally, renewal price change in the quarter remained positive as we continue to benefit from exposure increases as payrolls rise. Audit premiums continued to favorably impact growth as well. And medical trends continue to be below our long-run loss cost trend assumptions which we have not lowered despite the favorable trends over the last several years. Commercial retention was solid at 83%, down a few points in national accounts and middle market. I am very comfortable with the rate retention decisions the underwriters are making as they focus on leveraging this hard market, the right quality new business while increasingly optimizing the portfolio. The evidence of this can be seen across the Commercial portfolio, through the continued very strong pricing on property as well as the rate improvement we are achieving in the casualty lines, the consistently lower catastrophe results against our 10-year average and our record underlying profitability. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 88.3% and the underlying combined ratio was 86%. The underlying loss ratio of 57.9% is 0.7 points lower than last year and the expense ratio was 28.1%. As I mentioned earlier, our International segment benefited from a favorable reinsurance acquisition-related catch-up adjustment. And excluding this benefit, the International expense ratio would be 32.8% in the quarter. International gross written premium growth was 6%, and net written premium growth was consistent with last quarter at 9%. New business of $62 million was down in the quarter, but in line with last year on a year-to-date basis. Renewal price change was 7%, similar to the prior quarter and retention was strong at 84%. As I\u2019ve highlighted before, our International operation is consistently contributing profitable growth to CNA. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Dino, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional information on our results as Dino indicated. Core income of $289 million in the quarter compares to $43 million last year, and our core return on equity was 9.4%. On a year-to-date basis, core income of $922 million is a record high. Our third quarter P&C expense ratio was 30.1%, which is a decrease when compared to last year\u2019s third quarter expense ratio of 30.8%. The lower expense ratio in the current year is the result of higher net earned premium as well as a favorable reinsurance acquisition-related catch-up adjustment in the International segment, which reduced the total P&C expense ratio by 0.6 points. We continue to believe that a 31% expense ratio is a reasonable run rate going forward. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was favorable by 0.2 points. In the Specialty segment, favorable development in surety, was partially offset with unfavorable development in professional and management liability. The P&C paid-to-incurred ratio was 0.82 for both the current quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $33 million in the third quarter compared to a $25 million loss in the prior year quarter. The Corporate segment results include a $16 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort abuse claims. As a reminder, our specialists and environmental reserves are reviewed every fourth quarter. In Life & Group, we had a core loss of $29 million compared to $192 million core loss last year. Both periods were impacted by our annual reserve assumption update and essentially neutral $2 million unfavorable after-tax impact for the third quarter of 2023 and a $143 million unfavorable impact for Q3 2022. As we have noted in earlier calls this year, 2022 results have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of LDTI accounting for our long-term care business, which we adopted earlier this year. Life & Group investment income was up $29 million pretax compared to the prior year quarter, mostly driven by limited partnership performance. While underwriting results for the quarter include an estimated $4 million pretax unfavorable impact from $39 million of cash policy buyouts during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the reserve assumption updates and this quarter\u2019s policy buyouts, Life & Group underwriting results are flat compared to prior year. Each year, in the third quarter, we undertake our reserve reviews for Life & Group, which includes the analysis of reserving assumptions underlying our long-term care and structured settlement reserves. The key result of this year\u2019s update is essentially a neutral impact to Life & Group GAAP reserves. The results of that review are highlighted on Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. Our analysis involves a thorough review of all of our reserving assumptions, including cost of care, inflation, morbidity, persistency and rate increase assumptions. Note that under LDTI accounting, the net premium ratio can defer favorable or unfavorable results into future periods, depending on the policy or cohort impacted. The 2023 assumption updates lowered our net premium ratio, which defers some of the favorability into future periods. The result was an $8 million unfavorable adjustment to long-term care reserves after the deferral of $78 million of favorability into future periods. Finally, we have a $6 million favorable adjustment to structured settlement reserves, mostly due to more favorable interest rate assumptions. And while on the topic of long-term care, I would like to point you to Slide 14 of our earnings presentation, where we will provide a business update on our long-term care block. We believe our proactive approach to managing this block combined with the higher \u2013 combined with the current higher interest rate environment over the last 18 months has considerably improved the outlook for this business. As a reminder, our individual block has been closed since 2004 and our group business has been fully closed since 2016. We have achieved substantial reduction in policy counts since then, while achieving meaningful "

      "raw_bytes": "our individual block has been closed since 2004 and our group business has been fully closed since 2016. We have achieved substantial reduction in policy counts since then, while achieving meaningful rate increases and benefit reductions. And on the investment side, the favorable interest rate environment since early 2022 has improved the underlying economics of this business as we have been able to lock in high-quality, longer-duration securities at attractive coupons to support the liability duration of the business. Turning to Slide 15 of the earnings presentation, we drill into the individual block characteristics. This block is more mature with an average age \u2013 an average attained age of 81 years and generally features richer benefits including inflation riders on the majority of policies and lifetime benefits on some policies. The derisking of this block is well underway through in-force initiatives with policy counts down by 40% since 2015 and stable open claim counts. We believe that individual LTC reserves have hit an inflection point and have begun to decline using locked-in discount rate assumptions. On Slide 16, looking at the group block characteristics, the attained age is 68 years and compared to the individual block, the group block features less rich policy benefits. Only 1% of group policies feature lifetime benefits, the block has a relatively modest exposure to inflation and is more appropriately priced. We currently believe group reserves will peak in the mid and 2030s and at a significantly lower level relative to the individual block, primarily due to the lower benefit features and more appropriate pricing. Turning to investments. Total pretax net investment income increased 31% to $553 million in the third quarter. The increase was driven by our limited partnership and common stock portfolios, which returned a $28 million gain in the third quarter compared to a $44 million loss in the prior year quarter. Additionally, income from fixed income and other investments was $59 million favorable compared to the prior year quarter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to produce consistent income which has been steadily increasing as a result of favorable interest rates and strong cash flow from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated portfolio was 4.7% in the third quarter compared to 4.6% in the second quarter and 4.4% in the prior year quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, reinvestment rates continue to be significantly above our P&C effective income yield and have now surpassed our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield, which is a longer duration portfolio with embedded yields more comparable to today\u2019s interest rate environment. Net investment losses were $31 million in the quarter and included modest losses in our fixed maturity security portfolio, which were largely reflective of a modest amount of portfolio repositioning. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders\u2019 equity excluding AOCI of $12.3 billion or $45.43 per share, an increase of 7% from year-end 2022, adjusting for dividends. Stockholders\u2019 equity, including AOCI was $8.6 billion or $31.61 per share. With the increase in interest rates during the third quarter, the net unrealized investment loss in our fixed income portfolio stood at about $4.5 billion at quarter end. However, the LDTI single A interest rate adjustment of our liability for future policy benefits served to offset a portion of the unrealized investment loss in AOCI income by $807 million at quarter end. We continue to maintain a conservative capital structure with a low leverage ratio and a well-balanced debt maturity schedule. During the year, we have successfully issued $500 million of senior notes to help position us ahead of the upcoming debt maturities in November 2023 and May 2024. Operating cash flow remains very strong. In fact, the highest operating cash flow quarter since 2011. During the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $828 million, up from $737 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. Turning to taxes, the effective rate on core income was 20.6% for the quarter. And as I have noted in recent calls, looking forward, we expect an effective tax rate to be about 21%. Turning briefly to another topic, we expect to take a $24 million pretax Corporate segment impairment charge in the fourth quarter related to opportunities to optimize some of our real estate footprint in the post-pandemic work environment. We expect to continue to evaluate our own used real estate portfolio for further optimization opportunities which will allow us to utilize future savings to make additional investments in technology, talent and analytics. Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share to be paid on November 30, 2023, to shareholders of record on November 13, 2023 And with that, I will turn it back to Dino.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThanks Scott. The recap, CNA had an excellent quarter with strong levels of core and net income driven by increased levels of net investment income, which will continue to be a tailwind going into 2024, continued improvement in our core P&C underlying underwriting income and prudent cat management. We experienced continued pricing improvement in the quarter in the areas we believe need to stay higher for longer. Property pricing remains historically high in large national accounts and at a high watermark in our package business, which is rational given the persistent elevated levels of industry cat losses. Commercial casualty lines, most impacted by social inflation improved further in the quarter. And overall, Specialty pricing turned back positive on the pricing improvements in management liability and med mal. And finally, the dedicated focus to de-risk our runoff long-term care portfolio has had a major impact as policy counts are down more than 40% since the block was closed to new participants. And with that, we would be happy to take your questions."

Can you frame for us 30 years, 40 years of experience in markets, are we at the bottom? Can combined ratios get better 10 years from now, 5 years now, 3 years from now? How should we be thinking about what this business can underwrite to compared with where we are right now?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nOkay. There is a heck of a start of a question, Josh. Thanks for the question. I mean Josh, all I can say is after the financial crisis, there was a lot of concern about whether the insurance industry faced with lower interest rates for longer, could actually continue to generate similar strong return on equities, that it would require a considerable decrease in combined ratios. And I think there was some skepticism back then in \u201807, \u201808, and I think the industry and in particular, the best players have clearly responded. And I guess as we look over the last few years, one of the things that clearly surprised us was the impact of social inflation that we started to see in 2017 and literally doubled our long-run loss cost trends in the last 3 years or 4 years in the industry, along with its elevated cats responded, I think effectively in pushing for better pricing and better terms and conditions. It doesn\u2019t specifically tell you what\u2019s going to happen in 5 years or 10 years from now, Josh. But I think it reflects the resiliency of this industry. It\u2019s increased discipline to do what it needs to do to maintain reasonable returns. And I guess that\u2019s the best I can offer you.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay. Switching gears, I know, I mean the P&C results are great and maybe a lot of long-term care in the past. But when I am looking at the long-term care book with the third quarter reserve review ongoing, to what extent are the policies in that, I guess maybe as a percentage or maybe as sort of a block, are they being offered alternatives in terms of changing the terms of the policy? And what\u2019s the take-up rate on those who are offered changes in terms?\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nHey Josh, it\u2019s Scott here. Thanks for the question. So, we really started the policy buyouts late last year. We do those in conjunction with rate increases. Same with the benefit reduction options, we started those a few years back actually. And again, they are offered in connection with rate actions, rate increases. So, it\u2019s going to vary state-by-state. We had significant amount of activity in our group business for several large states earlier this year. It\u2019s still early days as far as take rates go, I would say, just off the top of the head, individual, we have seen 2% to 4% take rates, on the group business, somewhat higher, 5% to 8%. But we are still very much in the midst of these offers. Some of these numbers are still developing. I would say right now, it\u2019s been a relatively small proportion of policies that have been offered, benefit reductions and policy buyouts. Again, the buyout piece, we really just started right about a year ago or so. So, we still have some runway to go on that. We are \u2013 our rate increase programs are ongoing. We were fairly successful this year in achieving rate increases, and we expect that to continue going forward and expect to continue to offer those buyout options going forward.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nSo, just to understand, only a small percentage of the policies have been offered these options? And when I look at the amount taking up, it\u2019s in a single-digit percentage of the policies either took a buyout or a benefit reduction?\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThat\u2019s correct.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd when someone takes a benefit reduction, is it immediately beneficial to your capital position, or what are the economics for CNA when somebody says, I will limit the number of years of payout or I will cap my benefit, what happens to your balance sheet, your capital position when that occurs?\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nSo, that\u2019s an improvement. I mean that\u2019s a reduction in our reserves, both statutory and GAAP. So, it\u2019s obviously reflective of the lower risk in that policy going forward, and that\u2019s reflected in our results when that happens.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nPremium goes down, but capital goes up, I guess, is that right?\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nIn effect, correct because the reserve will come down. Reserves may come down too. Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question."

Meyer, I don\u2019t have that number on the top of my head. We can take that offline follow-up. So, we can get that for you.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nYes. Perfect, will do. And then a couple of other small questions. First, third-party captive gross written premium has been declining for almost 2 years. And I understand that has not been an impact on underwriting results, but I was just trying to understand what\u2019s going on there.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. It\u2019s really \u2013 and the captive is with respect to the cell phone business, and there has been merger there, and so we lost some premium on the cell phone capital. That\u2019s all it is, Meyer.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That\u2019s helpful. And then final question, and this is absolutely not CNA-centric, but the industry has been struggling with commercial auto for a long time, and it\u2019s great to hear that rate increases are accelerating. What has seen anything you do differently so that this perpetual problem of not being able to catch up with loss trends is no longer an issue?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. It\u2019s clearly been a catch-up game on commercial auto. It seems to be even though we don\u2019t have it, it seems to be some similar trends in personal auto. And I think it is the issue really around the same thing that\u2019s impacting, sort of excess casualty lines. The social inflation impacts had a big \u2013 has a big impact. But on commercial auto, you tend to see it impact the results quicker than on complex sort of BI losses. And so it\u2019s just a catch-up game. And I think it started off slowly, but it seems to be picking up momentum. And I really do think this is going to be a continuing trend for longer. And really, that\u2019s what you have to do. It just needs more pricing. And that\u2019s why we have been particularly focused on it. And whenever we do something like that, we highlight it to you. And we have seen an increase in this third quarter and in the second quarter. Now, we just got to keep pushing because the social inflation, I think impacts it quicker.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much."

With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dino Robusto.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Ralitza, and good morning all. In the fourth quarter, we produced very strong results, capping off another great year of excellent underwriting performance and robust investment income. Gross written premium ex-captive growth was double digit for the quarter and for the full year, representing our third consecutive year of double-digit growth. We achieved a 39% increase in underwriting gain for the quarter, which included modest catastrophe losses and we achieved record underlying and all-in underwriting gains for the full year. Net investment income before tax increased 21% and 25% for the quarter and full year, respectively. And importantly, in the lines of business with elevated loss cost trends due to social inflation impacts, that we've commented on over the last several quarters, renewal pricing continues to keep pace with loss cost trends, and we expect that to continue as we move into 2024. I will focus on the fourth quarter, but I will also provide key highlights associated with our full year results. Core income increased by $97 million in the fourth quarter to a record $362 million. Net investment income was $611 million pretax, up $108 million over the prior year's fourth quarter with our alternatives portfolio and our fixed income portfolio contributing almost equally to the increased income. Our P&C operations produced a core income of $434 million, up $92 million in the fourth quarter. The all-in combined ratio improved to 92.1%, a decrease of 1.6 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting relatively benign pretax catastrophe losses of $22 million or 1 point of the combined ratio and favorable prior period development of 0.3 points. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 91.4% in the quarter and represents the 12th consecutive quarter it has been below 92%. The underlying loss ratio in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 59.9%, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2022. The expense ratio of 31.2% was up slightly from last year. As usual, Scott will provide more details on expenses. In the quarter, we continued to achieve strong production performance with 10% growth in both gross written premium ex-captives and net written premium. Renewal premium change was 5% in the quarter, down 1 point from the prior quarter. Earned rate and the portion of exposure change that acts like rate was largely consistent with our estimate of long-run loss cost trend, which was unchanged this quarter. Let me add some additional color on the pricing environment as the individual lines within P&C are at varying stages of their unique cycle dynamics, given their respective loss cost pressures, different starting points in terms of profitability and the cumulative rate-level changes achieved in recent years for each line. Lines of business that have been impacted by social inflation have seen rate increases accelerate over the course of the year, like excess casualty where rate was up double digits in the fourth quarter compared to mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, commercial auto pricing continues to accelerate with prices increasing 14% in the quarter, up 5 points since the first quarter. Workers' comp rate change was low single-digit negative, given the continued strong profitability. Importantly, we are benefiting from 6 points of exposure change in the quarter for work comp and a good portion of that exposure increase is acting like rate. In our property line and the national accounts segment, we saw a deceleration in rate increases in the quarter, but they were still at positive mid-teen levels. And when you consider that rates in National Accounts Property are up cumulatively about 140% compared to five years ago, the moderation in increases in the reinsurance and primary market still reflect a very favorable environment in property. Within management liability, our D&O lines continue to experience rate decreases in the fourth quarter, but were less negative than any other quarter in 2023. We are hopeful that this portends some further moderation to avoid eroding the hard-fought cumulative gains in D&O pricing since 2019 that we believe need to persist. To date, cumulative rates for D&O overall are still up over 50% from 2019 rate levels, and for public D&O specifically, they are up roughly 75%. All told, I see the competitive environment as largely rational, and I would expect that to continue heading into 2024. In the quarter, new business growth was 16%, which was the highest it's been all year and was driven by Commercial, where we capitalized on strong pricing and an excellent pipeline of new business opportunities. Retention remained high at 85% this quarter, up 1 point compared to last quarter with strong retentions in each of our business units as we continue to lock in favorable rates, as well as terms and conditions across the portfolio. Turning to our three business units. The all-in combined ratio for Specialty was 90.8% in the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 91.4%, up 2 points driven by the expense ratio, which was 1.7 points higher compared to the prior year's quarter with mix driving higher acquisition costs as well as some additional employee-related costs. The strong underlying loss ratio of 58.6% in Specialty has been stable for the last three quarters. Gross written premiums ex-captive growth for Specialty was plus 1% this quarter, and net written premium growth was up plus 3%. Growth continues to be impacted by fewer new opportunities that we have commented on in previous calls, and we are remaining prudent on new business in the management liability lines until the competitive environment improves further. Our profitable affinity and health care businesses continue to produce mid-single"

Our profitable affinity and health care businesses continue to produce mid-single-digit and high single-digit rate increases, respectively, staying ahead of loss cost trends for those classes. And surety continues to produce very strong profitable growth. Retention was very strong at 89% for the quarter with each business area in Specialty achieving high retention levels. Turning to Commercial. The all-in combined ratio was 92.9%, the lowest in 15 years. The underlying and all-in underwriting gains were the best on record. Cat losses of $17 million added 1.4 points to the combined ratio, and the underlying combined ratio was 91.6%, a 1.1 point improvement over last year. Gross written premium ex-captives grew 20% in the quarter, and net written premium growth was 18%. New business grew 38% and was broad-based across the Commercial segments, and retention was 83% in the quarter, consistent with the last quarter. Renewal premium change was 9%, consistent with last quarter, with rate up 7%. Renewal premium change excluding work comp was 11% in the fourth quarter, continually -- continuing to readily exceed loss cost trends. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 93% in the quarter with about 1 point higher of catastrophe losses, but that represents only $5 million of cat losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 91.8% with an underlying loss ratio of 57.7%, which is down 0.4 points year-over-year. The expense ratio of 34.1% was higher by about 1 point due to higher employee-related costs. International gross written premiums and net written premiums were each flat in the quarter. International rate in aggregate was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter, and retention stayed consistent with the 3 prior quarters and a strong 83%. Now let me provide some perspectives on our full year results. For the full year, we achieved record core income with almost $1.3 billion or $4.71 per share, up 54% year-over-year. The increase in core income was driven by a significant increase in limited partnership and common stock returns as well as fixed income securities. Core income also benefited from record-high P&C underwriting gain this year and from a neutral impact on the Life & Group annual reserve review compared to a loss in 2022. Our P&C operations produced core income of $1.5 billion for the year, up 21% over the prior year. Pretax underwriting gain was $585 million, and underlying underwriting gain was $818 million, each a record high. The P&C all-in combined ratio was 93.5% with a record-low underlying combined ratio of 90.9% for the year, and this marks the seventh straight year of improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The underlying loss ratio was 59.9%, consistent with 2022. The expense ratio improved by 0.2 points to 30.7%, the lowest in the last 15 years. All 3 operating segments produced very strong all-in and underlying combined ratios again in 2023. For Specialty, the all-in combined ratio was 90.4% for the year, and the underlying combined ratio was 90.7%. Commercial produced an all-in combined ratio of 96% and an underlying combined ratio of 91.6%, both the lowest on record. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 92.6% and the underlying combined ratio was 89%. Turning to production for the year. Gross written premium growth ex-captives was 10% this year, and net written premiums were up 9%. New business grew by 11% to a record high of a little over $2 billion. Retention was very strong at 85%. Rates for the year were up 5%, and renewal premium change was 7% with exposures increasing 2%. Before I turn it over to Scott, I wanted to provide a little additional color on two items. First, on the social inflation impacted lines of business and the adverse development accident years of 2015 through 2019; and second, I also wanted to provide a little detail on the January 1 reinsurance renewals. The impact of prior period development was slightly favorable for the year for P&C overall with puts and takes by line of business and accident year, in terms of the accident year period of 2015 to 2019 that has generated adverse development quite broadly for the industry. In Commercial, our general liability line saw some continued strengthening for that period but was more than offset by favorable development in work comp. Commercial auto, another line heavily impacted by social inflation, had only slight unfavorable development for those prior accident years. In Specialty, medical professional liability, which has also had its share of reserve strengthening in the past few years, and we have spoken about this on prior calls, had a relatively smaller amount of adverse development for those older accident years, which was more than offset by favorable development in surety. So overall, in 2023, the impact from this adverse period was diminished for commercial auto and medical professional liability, and that is encouraging. For general liability, we had additional adverse development as the court backlogs began to clear and new claim information emerged. And more time is needed given the longer-tail duration on general liability before we know for certain if those years are completely behind us. At the same time, other long-tail lines like work comp and surety continue to play out more favorably than expected. In terms of the more recent accident years, the loss ratios are holding up well. As we have highlighted consistently, we took a conservative approach during the pandemic years, where we suspected that social inflation was merely obfuscated and retained most of the implied margin of earned rates in excess of loss cost trends. For accident years 2020 through 2022, for the social inflation-impacted lines of commercial auto, general liability and medical professional liability, in the aggregate, there has been little change to the initial accident year selections. Bottom line, our bias continues to be to react quickly to bad news, and we continue to take a measured approach to reacting to any favorable indicators in the more recent accident years. Turning to reinsurance renewals. As you know, our property treaties do not renew until June 1, but a number of our third-party treaties did come up for renewal in the quarter. All of the renewals went well. There was some minor movement in ceding commission on a few of the treaties, and most treaties renewed with comparable or slightly higher capacity. The economics of our reinsurance coverage and ceding commission remain very favorable on these lines of business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Dino, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional information on our results, as Dino indicated. Core income of $362 million is up 37% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, leading to a core return on equity of 11.6% and reflects a 21% increase in net investment income and a 39% increase in P&C underwriting gain. Our P&C expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 31.2%, which is about flat with last year's fourth quarter. Overall, higher net earned premium was offset by higher employee-related costs, including incentive compensation and legacy pension plan costs. As I've noted in prior calls, there will be a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to believe an expense ratio of 31% is a reasonable run rate for 2024. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 0.3 points favorable in the current quarter. Favorable development in the Specialty segment was driven by surety and was offset by management and professional liability.

      "raw_bytes": "rofessional liability. In the Commercial segment, favorable development in workers' compensation was partially offset by unfavorable development in general liability and commercial auto. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 0.72 for the fourth quarter and 0.8 for the full year 2023, which is about flat with 2022 and in fact has been relatively stable since the beginning of the pandemic. we do see some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter, so we tend to take a longer view of this metric. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $76 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $52 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2022. The loss this quarter includes the results of our annual asbestos and environmental reserve review. The results of this review included a noneconomic after-tax charge of $24 million driven by the strengthening of reserves associated with higher defense and indemnity costs on existing claims as well as lower expected ceded recoveries prior to the application of our loss portfolio transfer cover that we entered into in 2010. Following this review, our cumulative incurred losses of $3.6 billion remains within the $4 billion LPT limit, while cumulative paid losses are $2.5 billion. You will recall from the previous year's reviews that there is a timing difference with respect to recognizing the benefit of the cover relative to incurred losses as we can only do so in proportion to the paid losses recovered under the treaty. As such, holding all else constant, the loss recognized today will be recaptured over time through the amortization of a deferred accounting gain as paid losses ultimately catch up with incurred losses. As of year-end 2023, we have $417 million of deferred gain on our balance sheet that will be recaptured over time. This quarter's results also include a $12 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable development for legacy mass tort abuse claims. As we have noted in prior calls, we perform our annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter and all other Corporate segment reserves during the second quarter, although we will adjust such reserves in between these annual reviews as facts and circumstances warrant. Finally, the Corporate segment was impacted by a $19 million after-tax charge related to office consolidation we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call. We expect additional office consolidation activities in 2024, where we currently anticipate a Corporate segment charge totaling about $16 million pretax that will be spread across the first three quarters of 2024. For Life & Group, we had core income of $4 million for the fourth quarter, which was a $29 million improvement from last year's fourth quarter loss of $25 million. The results this quarter reflect a $33 million pretax decrease in -- increase in investment income primarily from higher earnings from limited partnerships. As we have noted in prior calls this year, our active in-force management risk mitigation activities continue, including rate filings, benefit reduction offers and policy buyouts. The current quarter results include a $4 million pretax loss related to $33 million of cash policy buyouts. Full year results include a $33 million pretax loss related to $193 million in cash buyouts of over 6,600 policies. We expect to continue offering buyouts in 2024, and the impact to GAAP earnings will vary quarter-to-quarter depending on timing and mix of buyout elections. Turning to investments. Total pretax net investment income was $611 million in the fourth quarter compared to $503 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven almost equally by our limited partnership and common stock results and our fixed income and other investments. Limited partnerships and common stocks returned a $78 million gain in the current quarter compared to a $20 million gain in the prior year quarter. Fixed income and other investments generated $533 million of income, up $50 million compared to the prior year quarter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to produce consistent income, which has been increasing as a result of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flow from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated portfolio was 4.7% in the fourth quarter compared to 4.5% in the prior year quarter. As of the end of the fourth quarter, reinvestment rates continue to be well above our P&C effective income yield and about flat to our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield, which is a longer-duration portfolio with embedded yields more comparable to today's interest rate environment. Pretax net investment income for the full year 2023 was $2.3 billion compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. Similar to the quarterly results, the increase was equally driven by our limited partnership and common stock results and our fixed income and other investments. Limited partnerships and common stocks returned a $202 million gain in the current year compared to a $31 million loss in the prior year. For the full year, our limited partnership and common stock portfolio returned 9.4%. Income from fixed income and other investments for the year was $2.062 billion or $226 million favorable to 2022. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect this trend to continue, albeit at a slower pace. We currently expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $2.150 billion for 2024, and we expect first quarter 2024 to be about $530 million, which is about flat compared to the fourth quarter 2023 result given limited anticipated reinvestment activity. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity excluding AOCI of $12.6 billion or $46.39 per share, an increase of 10% from year-end 2022 adjusting for dividends. Stockholders' equity including AOCI was $9.9 billion or $36.52 per share. With the sharp decline in interest rates during the fourth quarter, the net unrealized investment loss in our fixed income portfolio fell to just under $2 billion as of year-end, a significant improvement for both the quarter and the year. Finally, we ended 2023 with statutory capital in surplus in the combined Continental Casualty Companies of over $10.9 billion, which is up from $10.6 billion at the end of 2022. We continue to maintain a conservative capital structure with a low leverage ratio and a well-balanced debt maturity schedule. Earlier in 2023, we issued $500 million of senior notes, a portion of which served to fund the maturity of $243 million of debentures in the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was strong once again at $520 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year despite $193 million in long-term care cash policy buyouts during the year, reflecting both strong underwriting results and higher earnings from our fixed income portfolio. Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on core income for the fourth quarter was 20.3% and reflects tax-exempt interest benefit, somewhat offset by state income taxes. Looking forward, we expect our full year 2024 effective tax rate to be about 21% with a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. Finally, given the company's strong underwriting and investment performance, we are pleased to announce we are increasing our regular quarterly dividend 5% from $0.42 per share to $0.44 per share. In addition, we are declaring a special dividend of $2 per share, both to be paid on March 7, 2024, to shareholders of record on February 20, 2024. Using this past Friday's closing price, CNA shares have a very attractive dividend yield of 8.7%, inclusive of a $2 special dividend. With that, I will turn it back to Dino.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThanks, Scott.

      "raw_bytes": "Josh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nDino, I did take it at the last statement about loss cost inflation to be absolutely correct in your numbers. We have much more simple numbers. I think if we go back to 2020-2021, you had talked about moving the inflationary compounding effect in aggregate from about 5% to 6.5% over those two years. And right now, in aggregate, rate is up about 4% with another 100 basis points of exposure acting as rate. Those are pretty cumbersome numbers, but can you talk about how we should feel confident that the current rate environment is covering the loss cost if the numbers maybe don't seem to, I guess, factor in a number above 6.5%?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. So thanks, Josh. So our loss cost trends are running somewhere between 6% and 6.5%. They had gone up, as you pointed out. And at the time, I thought, okay, maybe 6.5%, but they're somewhere in and around 6% and 6.5%. And I commented on earned rate. Obviously, the earned portion of the rate is higher. And the exposure gains -- and exposure gains, about half of it acting as rate. It's different in different points. The work comp is probably a little bit more than half, and it was up 6%, the exposure. So I think, what I'm splitting hairs, that you're covering the long-run loss cost trends. And I think importantly, Josh, is why I tried to add a little bit more information on where I see the social inflation impacted lines, because those were the ones that had the moving target. That increase was -- that indeed what was increasing it from the 4.5% to 5%. And we're starting to see continued acceleration in those lines. So we feel very good going into 2024 that we should be able to continue to cover the loss cost trends.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nCan you give us a little granularity about workers' comp versus commercial auto? Obviously, workers' comp is helping the numbers. The loss rates are much better than anticipated, and commercial auto is doing the opposite direction. How much of a weight on your numbers is commercial auto? How much of a lift on your numbers is workers' comp? And given where the rate environment in each is, what do you expect the trend will be for next year?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. So let me try to parse it out this way. So commercial auto loss cost trends, as we indicated, they are above the average. And in fact, they're probably at high single-digit loss cost trends now. And we noticed that moving up at the beginning of the year which is why at the beginning of the year, we had about 9 points of rate on commercial auto, but now it\u2019s 14 points, because we just made the decision that we got to push harder or we're not going to get to the other end of this thing on commercial auto. And I think it's gone up from 9% to 11% to 14%. And it's early in January but still looking very strong. Comp, on the other hand, even with medical inflation up a little bit, still the long-run loss cost trends are below the overall average, clearly below our long-term assumptions. And rate, even though slightly negative with a very strong exposure growth, we think that dynamic continues or the combination of the two continues to be quite favorable for us going forward. I hope that helps.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd if I can add one more philosophically. It's been a very long time since workers' comp has been poor, and it's been a very long time commercial auto has been good. Is there anything to think about these two lines that something has permanently changed in them? Or it\u2019s just unusual factors that have made each of those cycles more extreme than they should have been?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. And so first of all, Josh, just to emphasize your point about each of their cycles, right, we need to think about our business going forward as unique cycles rather than the classic, oh, the hard market, now, it's going to go soft. And what I would just say on comp, obviously, different dynamics because of the regulatory impact. And many of the changes that happened over 10 years have really stuck, and that's fantastic and I think continues. Commercial auto, clearly, it appears that a lot more rate was needed even earlier and maybe in general, a little slow to respond. The only thing I would say there is because commercial auto, to a large extent, gets packaged with other very profitable lines of business, you're selling it with your package policy, which your work comps are very profitable. And so, you put it all together and you might be a little bit more tolerant. However, you cannot treat auto as a commercial loss leader. And I think there is an awareness for that. And I do expect that the pressure -- the upward pressure on pricing is going to continue as -- because, and it's part of my comment on rational pricing environment, I do think we're looking at it all in separate cycles and going after each one of them. And so that is probably what I could add.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nThat\u2019s very much appreciated."

Most of my questions are really smaller in scope. But you talked about medical inflation and workers' compensation picking up a little. What about other lines that also have medical exposure? Is the same trend showing up?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. I think it's -- there's a little bit of pressure on medical, but it's still relatively small and captured within our loss cost trends.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Excellent. You mentioned in your comments that D&O price decreases or rate decreases are slowing down. All in, I guess, financial institutions and management liability rate decreases got a little bit bigger than in the third quarter. So what lines are seeing the accelerated decline?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. So in the fourth quarter, because of what we call FIML, it's got a lot of lines of business in there. So in the quarter, you had a seasonality mix because we had a lot more of what is our miscellaneous professional E&O business in the fourth quarter. It's about 2 times the sort of average quarter. And in there, in particular, with some of the larger accounts on those lines of business and many of them excess, just had higher rate increases. So if you then break out two of the other sort of larger lines, as you pointed out, the D&O, we saw some moderation. The other one is cyber. But there too, although still negative, we saw some slight moderation also in cyber. But the seasonality mix of miscellaneous professionally is what caused it, Meyer.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Perfect. And then final question. In International, the gap between rate change and premium change, I guess, there wasn't. They were both 2%. Recent quarters have had somewhere between, I guess, 3 points and 5 points of what we would assume are exposure to unit growth. So I was hoping you could talk about what's changing there.\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. Thank you. First of all, just to remind every one of our definition of the exposure. So you have the classic sort of valuation increases in there or as companies sales go up and you capture, but whenever we have changes in participations in particular on different towers and we bring those down, that will show up as negative exposure. And in the quarter, in particular in International, we did come down on some property towers and also on some health care. And that more than offset the still increasing valuation increases that we're getting. So it is -- because we would put them together, it's the offset from the change in participations.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. So if I understand that correctly, there's still -- if we could isolate somehow just the exposure component acting as rate, it will still be favorable in International?\n\nDino Robusto - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes. Yes, it would be. It would be.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dino Robusto. \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Ralitza, and good morning all. In the first quarter, we produced very strong results with excellent profitability, higher investment income, robust top line growth and accelerating rate achievement in our commercial casualty lines as well as strong retention in all segments.   Core income increased by $30 million in the first quarter to $355 million, our highest first quarter core income on record. The last 2 quarters have produced the largest volume of core income on record for our organization, a testament to our underwriting performance, strong investment returns and overall profitable growth. Net investment income of $609 million pretax increased $84 million year-over-year, with our alternatives portfolio and our fixed income portfolio contributing almost equally to the increased income.   The all-in combined ratio was 94.6%, with pretax catastrophe losses of $88 million or 3.8 points of the combined ratio compared to the relatively benign first quarter last year with $52 million or 2.4 points. This year was more in line with our first quarter average of 3.7 points over the last 5 years. Prior period development for P&C overall was favorable by 0.2 points on the combined ratio.   Our pretax P&C underlying underwriting gain was over $200 million for the fourth successive quarter with a P&C underlying combined ratio of 91%. This is the 13th consecutive quarter with an underlying combined ratio below 92%. The underlying loss ratio was 60.5%, and the expense ratio was 30.1% in the quarter.   The underlying loss ratio was up a little more than 0.5 point compared to the most recent 4-quarter average. This slight increase was driven mainly by a mix shift within the Commercial segment, which had greater growth in national accounts in recent quarters where the casualty lines carry a higher underlying loss ratio. The remainder is from several puts and takes, including the negative rate pressure for several quarters in management liability lines, which impacts Specialty and, to a lesser degree, International as well.   In the quarter, we continued to achieve strong production performance with 8% growth in gross written premium ex captives and 6% growth in net written premium. Renewal premium change overall was 6%, up 1 point from the fourth quarter. Rate change was up 0.5 point, but still rounds to 4%, and exposure was also up 0.5 point.   In the U.S., where there has been persistent pressure from social inflation, rate was plus 6% ex work comp; and renewal premium change was plus 8%, which continues to be above our long-run loss cost trends of 6.5% in the U.S. Outside the U.S., long-run loss cost trends in the aggregate are about 1 point lower than in the U.S. as we don't experience the same level of social inflation pressure. So our overall P&C long-run loss cost trend remains between 6% and 6.5%.   New business was up 5% in the quarter to $529 million with continued strong growth in our Commercial business units, as we achieved throughout 2023. Overall, P&C retention remained high at 85% this quarter, consistent with last quarter.   Turning to our 3 business units. The all-in combined ratio for Commercial was 97.6%. Cat losses of $82 million this quarter added 6.8 points to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 90.8% was a record low and 1 point lower than last year. The underlying underwriting gain of $111 million in Commercial was a record high.   The underlying loss ratio was 62%, and the expense ratio was 28.2%, the lowest on record. As I mentioned last quarter, the loss ratios for the post-pandemic accident years in the classes of business most impacted by social inflation, med mal, auto, GL and excess casualty, continue to hold up well as we took a conservative approach in those initial loss ratio selections.   For the remaining classes in aggregate, we have experienced favorable development from the more recent accident years based on our initial loss ratio picks. Of course, these recent years are still immature, and we will continue to monitor for any emergence over time that deviates from our initial expectations.   Gross written premium ex captives grew 17% in the quarter, and net written premium growth was 13%. New business grew 18%, and retention improved by 2 points to 85% in the quarter. Renewal premium change in Commercial was 8%, with rate up 6% and exposure increases up 2%. Rate and renewal premium change excluding work comp were 9% and 10%, respectively, continuing to exceed long-run loss cost trends.   An area we have repeatedly highlighted for you is our success at pushing for higher pricing in our U.S. commercial casualty lines. And in the first quarter, commercial auto rate increases were up 14%, excess casualty was up 11% and primary general liability was up mid-single digit with renewal premium change of high single digit due to rising revenues and payrolls. These rate increases are double what they were 6 quarters ago.   Our national accounts rate increases are down a few points compared to the fourth quarter, which is mainly a function of quarter-to-quarter variability given the impact individual large accounts can have on the overall rate change. Although still early in the second quarter, we are not seeing that lower trend continue. In work comp, overall renewal premium change is about flat in the quarter with exposure increase offsetting low to mid-single-digit rate decreases.   Within Specialty, the all-in combined ratio was 90.7% in the first quarter, including 0.6 points of favorable prior period development, making this 15 straight quarters below 91%. The underlying combined ratio was 91.3% with an underlying loss ratio of 59.2%, and the expense ratio was 31.8%.   Gross written premium ex captives growth for Specialty was down 1% this quarter,"

Gross written premium ex captives growth for Specialty was down 1% this quarter, and net written premium growth was up plus 1. We capitalized on some growth opportunities in portions of our health care portfolio, but this was partially offset by our decision to remain prudent in our management liability lines until we see further improvement in the pricing environment.   Within Specialty, rates in aggregate were up plus 2% this quarter, reflecting a 2-point improvement from the fourth quarter. The rate declines in our financial institutions and management liability classes moderated this quarter, and public D&O was only slightly negative, improving in each of the last 3 quarters. Our health care rates continue to improve and are in the high single digits.   And the cumulative rate and improved terms and conditions we achieved over the hard market years is allowing us to profitably grow this business again. Our profitable Affinity Programs continue to produce stable rate change in the low- to mid-single-digit range, down slightly this quarter, which is impacted by program mix seasonality. Retention in Specialty remained very strong at 88% for the quarter, and retentions have been at or above 87% for almost 2 straight years.   For International, the all-in combined ratio was 93.3% in the quarter, including $6 million or 2 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio was 91.3% with an underlying loss ratio of 58.1%, and the expense ratio was 33.2%. The underlying combined ratio in International has been below 92% for 11 consecutive quarters.   International gross written premiums were down 6%, and net written premiums were down 4% in the quarter. Similar to the U.S. Specialty actions, we remained prudent in our management liability lines, which limited our new business opportunities. We also had a 2-point impact on retention from our underwriting actions to non-renew our political violence exposure, which we initiated in the fourth quarter.   Rates in International at 1% are down 1 point from the fourth quarter. Given the cumulative rate increases and extensive re-underwriting actions we took for the last several years, we expect our International operations to be an increasingly consistent contributor to our overall profitable growth.   And with that, I will turn it over to Scott. \n\nScott Lindquist - CFO or Senior Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThank you, Dino, and good morning, everyone. Core income of $355 million is up 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, leading to a core return on equity of 11.5% and reflects another quarter of strong underwriting and investment results.   Our P&C expense ratio for the first quarter was 30.1% compared to 30.0% (sic) [ 30.7% ] last year, reflecting higher net earned premium. We tend to have a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter in this ratio. For the balance of 2024, we expect higher spend on technology and talent as compared to the quarter just ended. Accordingly, we believe an expense ratio closer to last year's first quarter ratio of 30.7% is a reasonable run rate for the full year.   The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 0.2 points favorable in the current quarter. Favorable development in the Specialty segment was driven by surety and was partially offset by unfavorable development in warranty.   In auto warranty, higher labor rates and car part costs are driving an increase in severity, while higher car prices and interest rates are resulting in lengthier durations of car ownership, which leads to higher frequency of warranty claims. This same dynamic is impacting claims cost in our noninsurance auto warranty business, which were up 3%, while related revenues are flat as compared to 2023 first quarter. You can see these line items in the Specialty results of operations in our financial supplement.   For Life & Group, we had core income of $5 million for the first quarter compared to a $3 million core loss for the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earnings from limited partnership investments. Active in-force management risk-mitigation activities continue, including rate filings, benefit-reduction offers and policy buyouts.   The current quarter results include a $4 million pretax loss related to $29 million of cash policy buyouts. We expect to continue offering buyouts in 2024 with the impact to earnings from such activities varying quarter-to-quarter, depending on timing and mix of buyout elections.   Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $22 million in the first quarter compared to an $18 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Included in the first quarter results is a $5 million after-tax charge related to ongoing office consolidation activities I previewed in our last quarter's earnings call. Looking forward and as previously mentioned, we expect additional office consolidation charges of $7 million pretax in each of the second and third quarters.   Finally, a reminder that we will be undertaking our annual ground-up review of legacy mass tort exposures during the second quarter, the results of which will be recorded in the Corporate segment.   Turning to investments. Total pretax net investment income was $609 million in the first quarter compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven almost equally by our fixed income and other investments as well as our limited partnership and common stock portfolios. Limited partnerships and common stocks returned a $68 million gain or a 2.9% return in the current quarter compared to a $28 million gain or a 1.3% return in the prior year quarter.   Fixed income and other investments generated $541 million of income, up 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to produce consistent income, which has been increasing as a result of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flows from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated portfolio was 4.7% in the first quarter compared to 4.6% in the prior year quarter.   As of the end of the first quarter, reinvestment rates continue to be well above our P&C effective income yield of 4.3% and modestly above our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield of 5.6%. A reminder that the Life & Group portfolio is a longer-duration portfolio with embedded yields more comparable to today's interest rate environment.   Looking ahead, we currently expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $540 million in the second quarter, which will be a 7% increase from the second quarter of 2023. And for the full year 2024, we currently expect about $2.175 billion or a 5% increase as compared to the full year 2023, which would result in the total portfolio effective yield to approach 4.8% by the end of 2024.   At quarter-end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity excluding AOCI of $12.2 billion or $45.10 per share, an increase of 2% from year-end 2023 adjusting for dividends. Stockholders' equity including AOCI was $9.7 billion or $35.62 per share. As a result of rising interest rates during the quarter, the net unrealized loss in our fixed income portfolio is now at $2.3 billion as of quarter-end.   Finally, we ended the quarter with statutory capital and surplus in the Combined Continental Casualty Companies of $10.9 billion, which is flat with year-end 2023. Operating cash flow was strong once again at $504 million for the quarter despite $29 million in long-term care cash policy buyouts during the quarter, reflecting both strong underwriting results and higher earnings from our fixed income portfolio.   Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on core income for the first quarter was 20.9%, which is in line with our full year 2024 expectations. Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarter"

With that, I will turn it back to Dino. \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nThanks, Scott. CNA is off to an excellent start in 2024 with strong levels of core income driven by substantial net investment income and strong underwriting performance. We achieved high single-digit growth in gross written premium ex captives, and our retention remains very strong at 85%. The market remains rational in most classes of business with rates reflective of the individual dynamics impacting the various lines of business.  In the commercial casualty classes in the U.S., rates continue to improve. And then property rates, although off from their high watermark in 2023, continue to offer great new business opportunities. And so we remain optimistic about our ability to successfully navigate the favorable market dynamics and continue to grow the company profitably as well as build our investment returns.  With that, we will be happy to take your questions."

It was that good of a market. And things are more mixed today. Are they more mixed or less mixed than they were, let's say, in 2021? How good of a market is it out there? I know -- and that maybe things have gotten so granular and sophistication has gotten to a point that there will never be a universally hard market. But -- and indulge me for a second, some competitors didn't grow it all this quarter and some did, and it leaves a -- how good is that market that's out there right now? \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nJosh, it's Dino. We agree with you that the market is favorable, and we continue to take advantage of it. But you also highlighted that it's a nuanced, almost a mini-cycle approach. And that is indeed the issue and very, very different than prior cycles, without a doubt. And so we navigate each one accordingly.  On casualty, we continue to get very strong rate increases, and I expect they will continue. And that will continue to give us good opportunities as we saw in national accounts, also casualty as well as middle market. On property, when you think about all of the cumulative rate, you think about the valuation changes, the terms and conditions, see favorable opportunities there.  Management liability, notwithstanding that we still have a cumulative 50% to maybe 60% of rate increase since the start of the hard market, the reality is some of the competition, in particular from new entrants, as it has been expressed by others also, is too aggressive. And so we are fine to wait on the sidelines and pursue those areas so we can still have a good growth rate as we do, whether that be it in surety, be it in health care on the Specialty side or, as I just talked about, in the Commercial.  So I think it gets down to your point of a very nuanced mini-cycle market, and you have to act accordingly. But overall, I'd consider it a favorable market, and it's going to continue in '24. \n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd is it -- do you have the ability to capture as much business as you want where you want it? Or if your appetite increased, would that affect price? \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nSo what I would say is, Josh, over the years, in particular the last 6, 7 years, we've talked extensively about our migration from a generalist commercial underwriter to a specialist underwriter. And we focus on those specialties and we penetrate them quite successfully.   But as I've indicated before, our market share in a lot of those areas remains relatively small. So there is plenty of opportunity, and we're going to continue to go after it. It is one of the reasons, as Scott indicated, you're going to see additional investments, technology, talent. And then we're going to divert that to continue to penetrate our specialties. So we see plenty of opportunity. \n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd in terms of, Scott, you mentioned a warning -- or not a warning, as [ that evolved more ] completely, but just a guidance that we should expect that as usual, in 2Q, we're going to see the legacy mass torts review. Is that asbestos and environmental? Or are there other mass torts that get reviewed in 2Q? \n\nScott Lindquist - CFO or Senior Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nSo yes, thanks, Josh. It's Scott here. So if you take a look at historically, it's been kind of general mass tort. A couple of years ago, archdiocese cases, abuse cases over the past few years. I hate to predict what's going to happen this quarter. The team is still doing the work on that. But I would just kind of take a look at the history over the past few years and what we've done in the second quarter. And we've done some refreshes in the fourth quarter, too, the past couple of years. But that's probably all I'd say at this point. \n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd one mass tort that gets a lot of press, but there's not a lot of detail on or a lot of news per se, certainly, is PFAS. Is there anything that you can tell us about your thoughts on how you think about it? \n\nScott Lindquist - CFO or Senior Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nYes -- oh, go ahead. \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nNo, no, go ahead. \n\nScott Lindquist - CFO or Senior Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nNo, I was going to say, I mean I have no specific comments on that other than what we see out there is in our reserves right now. And I have nothing else really to say on that. \n\nDino Robusto - CEO or President (CNA Financial Corporation):\nTotally agree with Scott. It's early and limited information. What we have, as Scott points out, is in the reserves."

As we've indicated, we had some pressure on growth in the first quarter for the reasons that I also indicated in my prepared remarks, being that of being prudent on management liability and a decision to remove from political violence.  But going forward, we expect it to continue to contribute profitable growth to the organization. We feel very, very good about our International operations, in particular, when you consider that on some segments, the starting point is very good even before the hard market segments like middle market in the U.K. and Canada, we're already very profitable.

      "raw_bytes": "Dino Robusto - Executive (likely CEO or senior executive) (CNA Financial Corporation):\n[ The transcript was presubmitted by CNA Financial Corporation. No live call was conducted for the second quarter earnings call. ] Before providing remarks on our results for the second quarter, I would like to comment on the pending CEO transition that we announced on June 5, 2024 that takes effect January 1, 2025. For the past eight years, it has been my honor and privilege to lead CNA on a journey to record levels of profitability and production results. Doug Worman has been instrumental to the success achieved over the many years we have worked together, and he has been an outstanding partner in this journey as Global Head of Underwriting. I have absolute confidence that he is the right successor to drive CNA ever-forward to continued levels of top performance. I am also very pleased to assume the new role as Executive Chairman of the Board and strategic advisor, supporting Doug as CEO. Together with the Board, we are excited about the future of CNA and you should expect the same level of underwriting prowess and strategies that have been the hallmark of our success over the last eight years to continue unabated. In the second quarter we produced very strong results with excellent profitability including the fifth consecutive quarter with pretax underlying underwriting gain of $200 million or greater, higher investment income, solid top-line growth, and a one-point increase in Commercial rate. Importantly, for Commercial excluding workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation, written rate change is 8% and covers our loss cost trend, and, specifically for commercial casualty lines like auto and excess casualty, written rate change continues to be low double-digit and covers loss cost trend for the respective classes. Before drilling down further on the numbers, I wanted to begin by highlighting that over the last several years we have spoken extensively about loss cost trends, the philosophy behind how we have set our current accident year loss picks, and what we have experienced in prior year reserve development. These continue to be a primary focus for us so I will add some additional insight based on our recent experience in the quarter and the first half of 2024. Our long-run loss cost trends are unchanged and average about 6.5% overall. But as I indicated last quarter, several casualty lines have actually doubled over the last five years from the impact of social inflation -- namely commercial auto, primary general liability, and excess casualty in Commercial. And today the long-run loss cost trends for commercial auto and excess casualty are low double-digit. Primary general liability is slightly above the overall average, property is slightly below and workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation long-run loss cost trends are lower than the overall average. In our Specialty segment, the loss cost trend is around mid-single-digit with medical malpractice higher than the average and our affinity programs below the average. In our International segment, the overall average is also roughly mid-single-digit. We have also commented over the years on the reserve development we had experienced in lines like medical malpractice, commercial auto and general liability, inclusive of primary general liability, and excess casualty. Medical malpractice was one of the first lines of business where we began to see the impact of social inflation in 2017, and then in later years we saw evidence of it across commercial auto and primary general liability as well as excess casualty, which pressured reserves in the accident year block of 2015 through 2019. We previously commented on the reserve strengthening for those years, which was meaningful and almost entirely offset the favorable reserve development we experienced in workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation, surety and, to a lesser extent, our affinity programs. A point of emphasis we made in the past regarding workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation favorable development bears restating. We never lowered the embedded elevated frequency and severity trends from older years; instead, we have conservatively reacted in terms of favorable development to what we saw in the actual incurred data, because of concerns that medical inflation might deteriorate at some point in the future. Now, even though medical costs impacting workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation have been benign for a protracted period, we believe our reserving approach remains appropriate because our current view is that higher medical costs could eventually start to impact our workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation long-run loss cost trends. During the pandemic years we also commented on how actual loss activity abated from historical norms, yet we maintained our overall P&C underlying accident year loss ratio for the years 2020 through 2023 at right around 60% each year. We felt it was best to be conservative with the treatment of the implied margin expansion from earned rates being above loss cost trends during those years because we assumed that the pandemic was merely obfuscating the impact of social inflation. We believe that prudence boded well for the development of those accident years for the classes of business in the aggregate most impacted by social inflation, as our results continue to hold up relatively well against the initial loss ratio selections. Through mid-year 2024, one area we strengthened is commercial auto. Although long-run loss cost trends remained near 6.5% in total, the commercial auto loss cost trend increased a little over a point to low double-digit as a result of recent claims experience, but that was offset mainly by property lines where we see some abatement in the impacts of economic inflation. As a result of the increase in loss cost trend in commercial auto, we raised our underlying loss ratio pick for this line and we strengthened our commercial auto reserves for accident years 2022 and 2023 by $24 million with $3 million of favorable reserve development in older accident years. This increase, together with the mix shift towards national accounts we noted last quarter, pushed up the total underlying loss ratio in Commercial by a half point over the prior year quarter. In our Specialty segment, we increased the underlying loss ratio by one point in the first half of 2024 compared to last year even though loss cost trends remain stable. This increase is a function of written rates falling below long-run loss cost trends for several quarters in management liability lines. While cumulative rate increases achieved over the hard market period remain well above the rate level before the hard market, we are reacting conservatively to current pricing trends until we see greater discipline in the market. Bottom line, we believe we have been methodically and appropriately prudent on how we look at our loss cost trends, how we set our current accident year loss ratios and the reserve development movements we make as information unfolds in our reserve studies. Now let me provide some more specifics on our second quarter results. Core income increased by $18 million in the second quarter from the same period last year to $326 million, and core income of $681 million for the first half of the year is a record high, continuing to exemplify our underwriting discipline and profitable growth. Net investment income of $618 million increased $43 million year-over-year, with our fixed income portfolio contributing $30 million of the increase from growth in both book yield and our invested asset base. The P&C all-in combined ratio was 94.8%, with catastrophe losses of $82 million, or 3.5 points of the combined ratio, compared to $68 million, or 3.1 points in the prior year quarter. The catastrophe loss ratio is in line with our second quarter average over the last five years. Prior period development for P&C overall was favorable by 0.3 points of the combined ratio. The P&C underlying combined ratio of 91.6% was 0.5 points higher than the prior "

The P&C underlying combined ratio of 91.6% was 0.5 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio was 60.6% and the expense ratio was 30.7%. In the quarter, we continued to achieve strong production performance with 7% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives and 6% growth in net written premiums. Renewal premium change overall was 5%, down a point from the first quarter. Rate increases were stable at 4%, as they have been for three consecutive quarters, but with variation by segment and class, and exposure was down a point to 1%. Exposure change was stable in Specialty and International but was down close to two points in Commercial. As I have mentioned before, our exposure change metric measures not just the impact on premium from changes in total insured value, payrolls and revenues, but also the impacts of changes in coverage such as limits and deductibles as well as changes in participation on shared and layered accounts. This quarter, the decline in exposure change is most significantly impacted by reductions in participation on shared and layered property accounts as we are always seeking to optimize our capacity relative to pricing and terms and conditions. New business was up 7% in the quarter to a record high of $595 million with continued strong growth in our Commercial business units. Overall P&C retention remained high at 85% this quarter and has been right around this level for ten consecutive quarters. This reflects our emphasis on retaining the accounts we worked hard to secure over the last several years as we take advantage of a favorable market that continues to offer excellent opportunities. Turning to our three segments, the all-in combined ratio for Commercial was 97.0%. Catastrophe losses of $76 million this quarter added 6.1 points to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 91.0% was 0.6 points lower than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio was 62.0% and the expense ratio was 28.5%. The underlying underwriting gain of $115 million in Commercial was a record high. Gross written premiums excluding captives grew 12% in the quarter, extending the string of quarters with double-digit growth to nine consecutive quarters. Net written premium growth was 10%. New business grew 18% and retention was 84% in the quarter. Retentions improved in our middle market and construction business units this quarter but dropped in our national accounts and small business units. Within national accounts the retention can be impacted by just a handful of large accounts and that is exactly what we saw with increased competition late in the quarter. Within small business the lower retention was largely driven by actions we took on certain catastrophe-exposed business and underperforming liability business. Rate change in Commercial was 7%, up 1 point compared to last quarter. Rate accelerated in our construction and small business portfolios and was consistent with last quarter in middle market. Within middle market we continue to achieve low double-digit rate increase in commercial auto and property. Our national accounts rate was down slightly this quarter and was impacted to some extent by the increased levels of competition resulting in lower rate increase, but the impacts on retention were more pronounced where we chose to non-renew some accounts. On a product line basis, commercial auto rate increases were up 14% in the quarter and excess casualty rates were up 11%, each consistent with last quarter. Primary general liability rates continue to increase in the mid-single-digit range with renewal change a few points higher. Workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation rates continue to be negative due to favorable loss ratio results, but we continue to achieve low single-digit exposure increase on workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation accounts due to rising payrolls. Property rates increased by a point this quarter to high single-digit. We renewed all of our property reinsurance treaties on June 1st. We maintained, and in some cases even enhanced, the coverages and covered perils in all our treaties and layers. Our corporate catastrophe treaty had a small increase in attachment point to $250 million but we also purchased more protection at the top of the tower, which now provides coverage for up to $1.4 billion of losses. We achieved favorable terms and conditions and pricing on the property treaties this year reflective of our prudent management of catastrophe risk over time. Within Specialty, the all-in combined ratio was 92.7% in the second quarter, including 0.4 points of favorable prior period development. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1% with an underlying loss ratio of 59.6%, and the expense ratio was 33.2%. Gross written premiums excluding captives growth for Specialty was 2% this quarter and net written premiums grew 4%. Growth in Specialty is showing improvement compared to the recent four quarter average as we continue to capitalize on strong new business opportunities within our healthcare portfolio. Within Specialty, rates in aggregate were flat this quarter, down two points from the first quarter. But a good portion of this decline is simply due to a different mix of business by unit within Specialty between the first and second quarters. Our healthcare rates continue to improve and were 9% this quarter, up two points over last quarter. Our affinity programs continue to produce stable rate change in the low to mid-single-digit range, up a point this quarter. Rates in financial institutions and management liability continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and were slightly more negative this quarter. Even with rate declines stretching for nearly two years in financial institutions and management liability, cumulative rates since the beginning of the hard market are still up significantly. Retention in Specialty improved by two full points to an extremely strong 90% for the quarter. Retention improved by five full points in our healthcare business even with strengthening rates. Retentions have been stable in the low 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in our affinity programs. And our financial institutions and management liability classes had a two-point improvement in retention to 92%. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 91.9% in the quarter, including $6 million or 2.0 points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 90.9% with an underlying loss ratio of 58.1%, and the expense ratio was 32.8%. The underlying combined ratio in International has been below 92% for three consecutive years. Competition continues to be very strong in our International segment with gross written premiums down 1% and with flat growth in net written premiums. Rates in International were flat in the quarter, down a point from the first quarter, and retention was lower by about two points. In this declining rate environment, we are prepared to secure only the accounts where we can get the terms and conditions we deem appropriate to maintain the very strong profitability level we enjoy in our International portfolio.\n\nScott Lindquist - Executive (likely CFO or senior finance executive) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nCNA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core income of $326 million is up 6% compared to the prior year quarter, leading to a core return on equity of 10.6%, and reflects another quarter of great underwriting and investment results. Our P&C expense ratio for the second quarter was 30.7% compared to 30.9% in the prior year quarter reflecting higher net earned premium. As we have noted previously, while we tend to have a certain amount of variability quarter to quarter in this ratio, we do expect the expense ratio to be at about this level for the full year. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 0.3 points favorable in the current quarter. In the Specialty segment, favorable development in surety and "

In the Specialty segment, favorable development in surety and in casualty coverages associated with healthcare products was partially offset by unfavorable development in other professional liability and management liability. In the Commercial segment, favorable development in workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation was largely offset by unfavorable development in commercial auto and general liability. The unfavorable development in commercial auto of $21 million was concentrated in the most recent accident years as Dino alluded to and the unfavorable development of $19 million in general liability was across multiple accident years going back to 2014 and prior. In the International segment, favorable development in specialty coverages was partially offset by unfavorable development in commercial coverages. During the first quarter earnings call, we explained certain factors impacting our auto warranty business, namely, higher labor rates and car part costs are driving an increase in severity, and lengthier durations of car ownership resulting from higher car prices and interest rates are driving higher frequency of warranty claims. This same dynamic is continuing to impact claim costs in our non-insurance auto warranty business where pretax earnings before investment income of $16 million this quarter is down from $23 million in the prior year quarter, and year-to-date pretax earnings before investment income of $29 million is down from $46 million for the prior year six-month results. Please refer to the Specialty - Results of Operations page in our Financial Supplement for the detail on the non-insurance warranty revenue and expense line items that comprise pretax earnings before investment income. For Life & Group, we recorded a core loss of $1 million for the second quarter compared to a $20 million core loss for the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduced impact from long-term care policy buyouts and $10 million in higher investment income. Active inforce management risk mitigation activities are ongoing in our long-term care book, including rate filings, benefit reduction offers and policy buyouts. The current quarter results include a $2 million pretax loss related to $15 million of cash policy buyouts compared to $13 million pretax loss on $67 million of buyouts in the prior year quarter. We expect to continue offering buyouts with the impact to earnings from such activities varying quarter to quarter depending on timing and mix of buyout elections. Also, a reminder that we will perform our annual assumption updates for our Life & Group segment during the third quarter, which is consistent with historical practice. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $53 million in the second quarter, compared to a $46 million loss in the prior year quarter. We conduct a comprehensive review of mass tort reserves in the second quarter of each year and will also react to developing facts and circumstances in other quarters. As a result of this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comprehensive review, the Corporate segment results include a $28 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort abuse claims. In addition to the foregoing, the second quarter results for the Corporate segment include a $5 million after-tax charge related to ongoing office consolidation. Looking forward, we expect another real estate consolidation charge of similar magnitude in the third quarter. Also, a reminder that our asbestos & environmental reserves within the Corporate segment are reviewed in the fourth quarter each year. Turning to investments, total pretax net investment income was $618 million in the second quarter compared with $575 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 7%. The increase was primarily driven by our fixed income and other investments, which excludes earnings from investments in limited partnerships and common stock. Limited partnerships and common stocks returned a $78 million gain, or 3.1%, in the current quarter compared to a $68 million gain, also 3.1%, in the prior year quarter. Fixed income and other investments generated $540 million of income, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent contributions to core income, which have been steadily increasing as a result of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flow from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated fixed income portfolio was 4.8% in the second quarter, up from 4.7% in the first quarter and 4.6% in the prior year quarter. Reinvestment rates continue to be well above our P&C portfolio effective income yield of 4.4% and modestly above our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield of 5.6%. Looking ahead, and based on the current interest rate environment which is subject to change, we expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $545 million in the third quarter, which would be a 4% increase from the third quarter of 2023. In addition, for the full year 2024, we expect this figure to be about $2,180 million, or a 6% increase as compared to the full year 2023. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 equity excluding AOCI of $12.4 billion, or $45.86 per share, an increase of 5% from year-end 2023 after adjusting for dividends. Stockholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 equity including AOCI was $9.9 billion or $36.46 per share, at June 30, 2024. As a result of rising interest rates during the quarter, the net unrealized loss in our fixed income portfolio is now at $2.6 billion as of quarter-end. During the quarter, $550 million of senior notes matured, bringing our debt to capital excluding AOCI to just under 20%. Our next debt maturity of $500 million is due in the first quarter of 2026. Finally, we ended the quarter with statutory capital and surplus in the combined Continental Casualty Companies of $11.0 billion, which is about flat with year-end 2023. Operating cash flow was strong at $616 million for the quarter and compares favorably to $501 million in the prior year quarter. The higher cash flow reflects strong underwriting results and higher earnings from our fixed income portfolio as well as lower cash buyouts of long-term care policies. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on core income for the second quarter was 20.9%, which is in line with our full year 2024 expectations. Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share to be paid on August 29, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 12, 2024.\n\nDino Robusto - Executive (likely CEO or senior executive) (CNA Financial Corporation):\nCNA had a very strong second quarter, following up on an excellent first quarter, and has generated record core income for the first half of the year. Record levels of core income are reflective of disciplined underwriting, profitable growth and high levels of net investment income. We achieved 7% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives, 6% growth in net written premiums and our retention remains very strong at 85%. Our loss cost trends remain unchanged in the aggregate, but commercial auto continues to see elevated claim activity. We believe the double-digit rate increases in commercial auto and excess casualty, and meaningful high single-digits in medical malpractice will persist, thereby covering loss cost trends for these three classes of business most unfavorably impacted by social inflation. We remain optimistic about our ability to successfully navigate the current favorable market dynamics and to further the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profitable growth. We look forward to providing comments to you next quarter."

What do you expect?\n\nUnknown Executive - Executive (CNA Financial Corporation):\nBased on what we can see right now, in the financial lines there is a little bit of variability month to month, but we expect to see a little bit of moderation in the rate decreases in this area. In workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation, we anticipate it remaining in the mid-single-digit negative range. On property, rate has come down from where it was late last year; absent any significant catastrophe experience that this line tends to respond quickly to, we do not expect rate to re-accelerate and expect it to be in the low to mid-single-digit range in total. On the casualty lines pressured by social inflation, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, commercial auto and excess casualty are in the low double-digits and rates need to continue to increase. In International, we expect rate in the aggregate to stay roughly flat as margins are still favorable."

      "raw_bytes": "Dino Robusto - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\n[ The transcript was presubmitted by CNA Financial Corporation. No live call was conducted for the third quarter earnings call. ] In the third quarter, we produced very strong results with increased core income, the highest quarterly top-line growth of the year, excellent profitability including the sixth consecutive quarter with pretax underlying underwriting gain of $200 million or greater, higher investment income, and a one point increase in renewal premium change for both Commercial and Specialty compared to the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, core income is a record high at $974 million with an all-in combined ratio of 95.6% and an underlying combined ratio of 91.5%, up a little over a half point compared to the first nine months of 2023. Drilling down on third quarter, core income was $293 million including a $73 million year-over-year increase in net investment income to $626 million pretax. Our alternatives portfolio generated over half of the increase, and the growth in our fixed income portfolio was due to both a higher book yield and a larger invested asset base. The P&C all-in combined ratio was 97.2%, with previously announced catastrophe losses of $143 million or 5.8 points of the combined ratio, in line with the third quarter average over the last five years. Prior period development for P&C overall was favorable by 0.2 points of the combined ratio. The P&C underlying combined ratio of 91.6% represents the fifteenth consecutive quarter below 92%. In the quarter, we achieved the strongest production performance of the year with 9% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives and 8% growth in net written premiums. Renewal premium change for P&C overall was stable with the second quarter at 5%, but was up one point in the U.S. to 6%, and down in International by a point to 1%. Rate increases in the U.S. remained stable at 4% while in International rates in the aggregate went slightly negative. P&C retention remained high at 85% this quarter even as we achieved an additional point of renewal premium change in the U.S. New business was up 15% in the quarter to $547 million, reflecting the strongest quarterly growth of the year with each operating segment contributing to positive new business growth. Turning to our three business units, the all-in combined ratio for Commercial was 100.2%. Catastrophe losses of $127 million this quarter added 9.6 points to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 90.7% was a record low and was 0.8 points lower than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio was 62.5%, up half a point from the second quarter as a result of the continuing impact of the mix shift toward national accounts as well as the continuation of the more recent loss activity in commercial auto being higher than the embedded long run trend, each of which we addressed in our remarks last quarter. The expense ratio was a record low at 27.7%, resulting in a record high underlying underwriting gain of $124 million. Gross written premiums excluding captives grew 15% in the quarter, and growth is also 15% on a year-to-date basis. Net written premiums growth was 14%. New business grew 18%, the strongest level this year, and retention was 84% in the quarter. Retentions improved in our middle market and national accounts business units but dropped a few points in construction as we walked away from accounts where we couldn't get the necessary pricing on the auto exposures. Renewal premium change in Commercial was up a point from the second quarter to 8%. Renewal premium change for Commercial excluding workers' compensation was up two points to 10%. Rate change in Commercial was 6%, down one point compared to last quarter as the rate in property dropped two points but was still a healthy 7%. Commercial auto rates continue to rise and were 15% this quarter, and excess casualty rates were 10% and have been double-digit all year. Primary general liability rates continue to increase in the mid-single-digit range with renewal premium change in the high single-digits. For commercial casualty lines, including auto, primary general liability and excess casualty, renewal premium change was 11%. In workers' compensation, rates continue to be negative due to favorable loss ratio results, but we see beneficial exposure increases due to rising payrolls. Within Specialty, the all-in and underlying combined ratio remained very profitable in the third quarter at 93.0%. The expense ratio was 32.7% and the underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, up a half point from the second quarter primarily from continued pricing pressure in management liability lines, which have now experienced ten consecutive quarters of rate declines. While the portfolio continues to perform very well, the protracted period of rates below loss cost trends portends potential margin compression in the future as the decreases earn in, so we continue to react prudently. The small underlying loss ratio adjustments in Commercial and Specialty this quarter compared to the second quarter reflect our best estimate of the impacts for the latter half of accident year 2024. Specialty production performance in the quarter improved with gross written premiums excluding captives growth of 3% this quarter and net written premiums growth of 4%. We achieved double-digit growth in surety this quarter where several project backlogs came to fruition with some of our long-standing accounts. Our healthcare business grew mid-single digits this quarter, and our financial institution and management liability business grew mid-single digits from strong retention and double-digit new business growth in private directors and officers (D&O). Within Specialty, rates in aggregate were flat this quarter, similar to last quarter. We continue to secure high single-digit rate increases in our healthcare business. Our affinity programs continue to produce stable low single-digit rate increases, and rates in financial institutions and management liability continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and while still negative, improved by a point this quarter. Notwithstanding the more recent rate declines, we continue to optimize our portfolio through risk selection and managing limits and attachment points. Retention in Specialty was 89% and has remained stable at about this level for over two years. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 96.1% in the quarter, including $16 million or 5.1 points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio continues to be very strong at 91.7%, with an underlying loss ratio of 58.1%, and an expense ratio of 33.6% compared to 28.1% in the prior year quarter. The expense ratio increase was primarily driven by a favorable reinsurance acquisition related catch-up adjustment in the prior year quarter and higher employee related costs in the current quarter. Competition continues to be strong in our International segment resulting in flat growth in gross written premiums. Net written premiums were down 2%, or 1% excluding currency fluctuation. Rates in aggregate for International turned low single-digit negative this quarter; but there are differences in pricing and competition by geography and product, which allowed us to continue to grow new business by 18% in the quarter and improve retention by two points to 82%.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nCNA's third quarter core income of $293 million is slightly above the prior year quarter, while year to date core income is up 6% to a record best of $974 million, which translates to an annualized core return on equity of 10.3% and reflects another quarter of strong underwriting and investment results.

      "raw_bytes": ". Our P&C expense ratio for the third quarter was 30.2% and is about flat to the prior year quarter. A favorable International reinsurance acquisition related catch-up adjustment in the prior year quarter was largely offset by higher net earned premiums in the current quarter. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 0.2 points favorable in the current quarter. In the Specialty segment, prior period development was neutral overall, and this was mostly attributable to favorable development in surety offset by unfavorable development in management liability related to accident year 2019. In the Commercial segment, prior period development was slightly favorable overall with favorable development in workers' compensation, the majority of which is attributable to accident years 2018 and prior, unfavorable development in commercial auto in recent accident years, and unfavorable development in general liability driven by excess casualty across multiple accident years back to 2015. In the International segment, prior period development was slightly favorable in the quarter. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $44 million in the third quarter, compared to a $33 million loss in the prior year quarter. The current quarter includes $11 million of income from the amortization of a deferred gain related to the asbestos and environmental pollution loss portfolio transfer, compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter, and a $3 million after-tax charge related to the planned office consolidation efforts we have disclosed previously. The Corporate segment results also include a $17 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable prior period development largely associated with legacy mass tort abuse claims, compared to a $16 million after-tax charge in the prior year quarter. We note that, as has been the case in recent years, the results of our annual asbestos and environmental reserve review will be reflected in our fourth quarter earnings in the Corporate segment. In the Life & Group segment, we recorded a core loss of $9 million for the third quarter compared to a $29 million core loss in the prior year quarter. Life & Group investment income was up $24 million pretax compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by our alternatives performance, while underwriting results for the quarter include a negligible impact from $23 million of cash policy buyouts. In addition, both periods were impacted by our annual reserve assumption updates, a $5 million unfavorable aftertax impact in 2024 and a $2 million unfavorable impact for 2023. Each year in the third quarter, we undertake our reserve reviews for Life & Group, which includes the analysis of reserving assumptions underlying our Long-Term Care (LTC) and structured settlement reserves. The assumption updates for LTC and structured settlements were favorable, with the LTC favorability being deferred into future periods under Long Duration Targeted Improvements (LDTI) accounting. Taken together, the third quarter reserve reviews resulted in an essentially neutral impact to reserves for Life & Group. The results of our annual reviews are highlighted on Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. Our analysis involves a thorough review of all our reserving assumptions including cost of care inflation, morbidity, persistency and rate increase assumptions. Notably for this year's assumption update, we meaningfully outperformed rate increase assumptions driven by significant rate approvals in several large states. We also strengthened our assumption on cost of care inflation. Under LDTI accounting, the net premium ratio can defer favorable or unfavorable results into future periods, depending on which policy year cohort is impacted. The 2024 assumption updates were favorable, lowering our net premium ratio and deferring the favorability into future periods based on cohort. The result was a $15 million unfavorable adjustment to LTC reserves after the deferral of $65 million of favorability into future periods over the remaining life of the policies. Updates to best-estimate assumptions also impact our LTC statutory margin. These assumption revisions increased our statutory margin to $1.4 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year ago. Similar to GAAP, the statutory margin benefited from outperformance on recent rate approvals, offset by the strengthening of our assumption on cost of care inflation. Additionally, the higher interest rate environment positively impacted the LTC statutory margin from interest rates exceeding expectations. Finally, the annual structured settlement reserve review resulted in a $9 million favorable adjustment to GAAP reserves, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 14 of our earnings presentation provides an update on our LTC business. We believe our proactive approach to managing this portfolio, combined with the higher interest rate environment over the last three years, has considerably improved the outlook for this business. Our Individual block has been closed since 2004 and our Group block has been closed since 2016. We have achieved substantial reduction in policy exposure since then, while at the same time obtaining substantive rate increases and benefit reductions via our active inforce management, inclusive of our ongoing policy buyout program. On the investment side, the favorable interest rate environment since early 2022 has improved the underlying economics of this business, as we have been able to lock-in high quality, longer duration securities at attractive coupons to support the underlying liabilities of the business, essentially achieving appropriately matching asset and liability durations. This is evident in the statutory margin which has grown by nearly $300 million since 2022. Slide 15 of the earnings presentation provides details on the Individual block characteristics. This block is more mature with an average attained age of 82 years and generally features richer benefits including inflation riders on most policies and lifetime benefits on some policies. The de-risking of this block continues through inforce initiatives, with policy counts down by 46% since 2015 and stable open claim counts. Going forward, we currently expect policy counts to decline by 65% from the current level over the next ten years. We believe the Individual LTC reserves have hit an inflection point and have begun to decline using locked-in discount rate assumptions. Slide 16 of the earnings presentation provides details on the Group block characteristics. The attained age is 69 years, and compared to the Individual block, the Group block features less rich policy benefits. Only 1% of Group policies feature lifetime benefit periods and the block has a relatively modest exposure to inflation. As is the case with the Individual block, the de-risking of the group block continues through inforce initiatives, with policy counts down by 46% since 2015 and stable open claim counts. Going forward, we currently expect policy counts to decline by 25% from the current level over the next ten years. We currently believe Group LTC reserves will peak in the mid-2030s, and at a substantially lower level relative to the Individual block primarily due to the lower benefit features and more appropriate pricing. Turning to investments, total pretax net investment income was $626 million in the third quarter compared with $553 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 13%. The increase was primarily driven by our alternatives portfolio, which returned an $80 million gain, or 3.1%, in the current quarter compared to a $28 million gain, or 1.3%, in the prior year quarter. Fixed income and other investments generated $546 million of income, up 4% compared to the prior year quarter.

      "raw_bytes": "rter. Our fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent contributions to core income, which have been steadily increasing because of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flow from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated fixed income portfolio was 4.8% in the third quarter, up from 4.7% in the prior year quarter. Reinvestment rates continue to be above our P&C portfolio effective income yield of 4.3% and are fairly in line with our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield of 5.7%. Based on the current interest rate environment, we expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $550 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 2024 figure to about $2,175 million, or a 5% increase as compared to the full year 2023. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $12.6 billion, or $46.50 per share, an increase of 7% from year-end 2023 after adjusting for dividends paid. Stockholders' equity including AOCI was $10.8 billion or $39.72 per share, at September 30, 2024. As a result of falling interest rates during the quarter, the net unrealized loss in our fixed income portfolio was reduced to $1.0 billion as of quarter-end. Our debt-to-capital excluding AOCI remains just under 20% and our next debt maturity of $500 million is due in the first quarter of 2026. Finally, we ended the quarter with statutory capital and surplus for the combined Continental Casualty Companies of $11.3 billion, up modestly from year-end 2023 reflecting strong statutory earnings net of dividends paid to our holding company. Operating cash flow was strong at $748 million for the quarter as compared to $828 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter's cash flow results reflect certain ceded reinsurance premium payments that occurred in last year's fourth quarter. Despite this, operating cash flow remains strong reflecting strong underwriting and investment results. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on core income was 21.9% for the third quarter, and 21.2% for the year-to-date period, which is in line with our full year 2024 expectations. We closed on the previously announced pension risk transfer transaction on October 10, 2024, that will impact our fourth quarter results. Through the purchase of a group annuity contract, we transferred over $1 billion, or approximately 60%, of our legacy U.S. pension obligations to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. This transaction accomplishes a significant de-risking of our legacy pension obligations while protecting plan participants. As we previously noted, this transaction will result in a one-time, non-cash, pretax settlement charge of $370 million ($290 million, net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2024. This charge is largely driven by the accelerated recognition of the actuarial pension loss from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income, which such acceleration does not impact stockholders' equity. The actual charge will depend on finalization of actuarial and other assumptions. This charge will not impact core income or cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2024. For further information on this transaction, please refer to our third quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. Finally, we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share to be paid on December 5, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2024.\n\nDino Robusto - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nCNA had a very strong third quarter, following up on an excellent first half, and has generated record core income on a year-to-date basis and for the most recent four-quarter period. Record levels of core income are reflective of disciplined underlying underwriting execution and prudent catastrophe management, profitable growth and high levels of net investment income. We achieved 9% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives, which is up two points from the second quarter and represents our strongest quarter of the year. We are achieving strong renewal pricing increases in the lines most impacted by social inflation, which continue to exceed long-run loss cost trends. Our retention remains very strong at 85%, and our new business production growth in the quarter was the highest of any quarter this year. We remain optimistic about our ability to continue to successfully navigate the market to capitalize on the best opportunities and grow profitably, even while stepping back without hesitation when the competitive landscape doesn't allow us to secure our required returns. Building on our year-to-date performance, we look forward to providing comments to you next quarter. As we announced earlier in the year, effective January 1, 2025, I will be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board as Doug Worman becomes the President and Chief Executive Officer of CNA. I look forward to my new role in the Company, and I am confident that Doug, together with the remarkable leadership team at CNA, will continue to build on our track record of profitable growth. It has been an absolute pleasure for me to serve as the CEO of CNA over the last 8 years, in large part because of the opportunity to work closely with approximately 6,500 extremely talented team members across the organization who will continue to drive CNA's success going forward.\n\nOperator - Operator (CNA Financial Corporation):\nWe invite shareholders and analysts to submit questions for management in advance of each quarter's earnings release. Below we address some questions we have received as well as some timely and topical focus areas for CNA and our industry."

      "raw_bytes": "As to the pension risk transfer transaction, what will be the impact on expenses on a run-rate basis?\n\nUnknown Executive - Executive (CNA Financial Corporation):\nWe closed on a pension risk transfer transaction several weeks ago for about 60% of our $1.7 billion defined benefit pension obligation. We previously disclosed that we will incur a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $290 million (after-tax) in our fourth quarter earnings, which will be outside of core income. This reflects settlement accounting where we record an approximate pro-rata portion of our unamortized net actuarial loss that resides in AOCI into earnings. In normal course this unamortized net actuarial loss would otherwise be amortized into earnings in future years as the pension obligation runs off. If you look at Note H of our third quarter 2024 financials in our 10-Q, you will see our net pension expense is minimal for the year, excluding settlement charges. Each component of the pension expense would be reduced by roughly 60% into 2025 (as we've now reduced the assets supporting the pension, the pension obligation and actuarial loss by roughly 60%) so we expect the impact on expenses to continue to be insignificant going forward, all else equal. As a reminder, there are other moving parts that will determine total 2025 pension expense including where interest rates are on December 31, 2024, and our go-forward assumption of expected return on pension assets. Accordingly, we anticipate disclosing additional information regarding the precise effect of this transaction and updated assumptions in our first quarter 2025 results."

These investments were redeployed in our P&C portfolio in exchange for high quality, long duration fixed income securities with attractive yields that will further aid our asset-liability management objectives. Over the past two years we have been able to take advantage of higher interest rates to extend the maturity of our Life & Group fixed income portfolio while also achieving yields that surpassed our reserving assumptions. The cumulative result of this activity has significantly reduced the level of reinvestment risk in this block, with the duration gap between our assets and liabilities now under one year."

The FX gain this quarter was driven by the U.S. dollar weakening against the British pound during the quarter. Our Lloyd's syndicate has U.S. dollar insurance reserves that revalue to the syndicate's functional currency of the British pound through the income statement. Note that economically our Lloyd's investment portfolio is also denominated in the U.S. dollar, thus effectively hedging our currency risk and this change is reflected through other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity."

No live call was conducted for the fourth quarter earnings call. ] Before we discuss our results for the quarter, on behalf of all our employees, I want to take a moment to express our deepest sympathies to the victims of the tragic wildfires in California. We have all seen the heartbreaking devastation caused by this disaster, and our thoughts are with everyone who has suffered such profound losses. Our CNA colleagues have been on the ground and we remain steadfast in our commitment and unwavering support to assist our customers who have been affected by this tragedy. In the fourth quarter, we produced very strong results, with record underlying underwriting gain, the highest level of net investment income of the year, and at 10%, the highest quarterly net written premium growth of the year. Net investment income increased 5% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. We achieved continued rate improvement in the classes of business most impacted by social inflation where rates in our commercial casualty classes of business were up a point to 10%, which continues to exceed loss cost trends. Core income was $342 million in the fourth quarter. Net investment income was $644 million, up $33 million over the prior year quarter, with strong performance in our fixed income portfolio and strong contributions from limited partnerships and common stock. The P&C all-in combined ratio was 93.1%, an increase of 1.0 point compared to the prior year quarter. The increase is principally from higher catastrophe losses of $45 million, or 1.8 points, compared to a fairly benign $22 million, or 1.0 point of catastrophe losses, in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily related to Hurricane Milton. The catastrophe loss ratio in the fourth quarter is slightly below our five year average of 2.0 points. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 91.4% in the quarter, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. We have now produced sixteen consecutive quarters of underlying combined ratios below 92%. The underlying underwriting gain was up 10% in the quarter to a record high of $222 million. The underlying loss ratio in the fourth quarter was 61.1%, consistent with the third quarter. The expense ratio of 30.0% was the lowest since 2008, a significant contributing factor to our excellent underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. In the quarter, we continued to achieve strong production performance with 9% growth in gross written premiums excluding captives and 10% growth in net written premiums. P&C rate change was 3% in the quarter, consistent with last quarter, although there is variation by segment and class of business. In Commercial, rate change was 6% all-in, consistent with last quarter, and 8% excluding workers' compensation. Commercial auto rates were up 17% and excess casualty rates were up 11%, each representing the strongest quarterly rate increase of the year and exceeding long-run loss cost trends that remained unchanged from last quarter. Property rates are still strong with mid single-digit increases, but were down from the double-digit range in 2023 and high single-digit increases obtained in the first half of 2024. Workers' compensation rates were down low to mid single digits consistent with the historical profitability of that line, offset by a roughly equal amount of exposure increase, resulting in flat renewal premium change. In Specialty, rate turned positive this quarter at 1%. Rate was strong in healthcare at 9%, up two points from last quarter and continues to exceed loss cost trends. Rates were 3% in our affinity business, up one point over last quarter. Rates were still negative in our management liability lines, but in public directors and officers (D&O) and cyber, rate change was much closer to flat compared to more substantial rate declines in prior quarters. In our International segment, rates turned slightly negative for the latter half of 2024, but the performance of our International business remains fundamentally strong. In the quarter, new business growth was 8%, with double-digit growth in Commercial and International driving the overall result. Retention was 86% this quarter, up a point compared to last quarter, and represents our highest quarterly retention of the year as we continue to retain our profitable portfolio of accounts. Turning to the quarterly results in our three operating segments, in Commercial, the all-in combined ratio was 92.3%, the lowest since 2008. The all-in underwriting gain of $106 million was the best on record. Catastrophe losses of $33 million added 2.3 points to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio was a record low of 90.0%, a 1.6 point improvement over last year, leading to record underlying underwriting gain of $139 million. The underlying loss ratio was 62.5%, consistent with the third quarter. The expense ratio was a best on record 27.0%. This is a significant improvement from the low to mid 30s expense ratios recorded by the Commercial segment during the soft market years. Gross written premiums excluding captives grew 11% in the quarter and net written premium growth was 12%. New business grew 12% and retention was 84% in the quarter, consistent with the last two quarters. Exposure change was 1% for Commercial this quarter. In areas such as general liability and workers' compensation, we continue to see the benefit of exposure change that acts like rate. Conversely, exposures were down in national accounts from reductions in participation on shared and layered property accounts and changes in limits and deductibles on casualty accounts as we continue to seek to optimize terms and conditions. The all-in and underlying combined ratio for Specialty was 93.8% in the fourth quarter. The underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, consistent with last quarter, and the expense ratio was 33.4%, up 0.9 points compared to prior year due to lower net earned premiums. Gross written premium growth excluding captives for Specialty was 4% this quarter and net written premium growth was 5%, representing the strongest growth in ten quarters. We're seeing increased profitable growth in affinity and continued strong growth in surety. Retention was strong at 89% for the quarter and has been around this level for ten straight quarters. For International, the all-in combined ratio was 94.8% in the quarter with almost four points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 91.3%, with an underlying loss ratio of 58.1%, which has been stable all year, and the expense ratio of 33.2% was lower by 0.9 points compared to prior year. International gross written premiums grew 8% in the quarter and net written premiums grew 13%. Net written premiums benefited from some favorable adjustments on prior year reinsurance treaties during the quarter. We also benefited from strong new business growth and high retention of 85% this quarter as we retained our high performing business. For the full year, we achieved record core income of $1,316 million, $32 million greater than 2023. Core earnings per share was $4.83, up $0.12 year over year despite elevated catastrophe losses compared to the prior year. The increase in core income was reflective of record high P&C underlying underwriting gain of $840 million and a $233 million increase in net investment income, split roughly evenly between our fixed income portfolio, and limited partnerships and common stock, to nearly $2.5 billion. The P&C all-in combined ratio was 94.9% and catastrophes were 3.6 points of the combined ratio or $358 million. The catastrophe ratio is consistent with our most recent five year average. The underlying combined ratio was 91.5% for the year. The underlying loss ratio was 60.9%, up a point compared to the prior year for reasons we've discussed in prior quarters. The expense ratio improved by 0.5 "

The expense ratio improved by 0.5 points to 30.2%, the lowest since 2008, benefiting from higher net earned premiums while we continue to invest in the business. For P&C overall, the impact of prior period development was slightly favorable for the year. While we had unfavorable development in the commercial casualty lines, as well as the professional and management liability lines, it was offset by continued favorable development in our workers' compensation and surety classes of business. All three operating segments produced very strong all-in and underlying combined ratios again in 2024. For Commercial, the all-in combined ratio was 96.7% for the year, up 0.7 points compared to last year. The increase was due to a greater impact from catastrophes in 2024 compared to 2023. The underlying combined ratio improved by a full point to a record best of 90.6%. Specialty produced an all-in combined ratio of 92.6% and an underlying combined ratio of 92.9%. In each case, the Specialty combined ratios are up slightly more than two points due to an increase in the loss ratio and expense ratio, which we have previously commented on. For International the all-in combined ratio was 94.0% and the underlying combined ratio was 91.2%, up 2.2 points compared to prior year and mostly attributable to a lower expense ratio in the prior year due to a favorable reinsurance acquisition related catch-up adjustment. All three operating segments continue to produce strong underlying underwriting gain and all-in underwriting gain. Turning to production for the year, P&C gross written premiums excluding captives and net written premiums each grew 8%. New business grew by 9% to a record high of $2,262 million. Retention was very strong at 85%, consistent with last year. Rates for the year were up 4%, down a point from 2023, and renewal premium change was 5%, with exposures increasing 1%, also down a point compared to 2023. A majority of our third-party treaties came up for renewal on January 1st. All of the renewals were successful. Most treaties were oversubscribed and renewed with favorable terms. The economics of our reinsurance coverage and ceding commission remain very favorable on these lines of business. Finally, a note on our estimated exposure relating to the California wildfires -- we currently estimate net exposure in the range of $40 million to $70 million. We will continue to evaluate our exposure as this is a developing situation.\n\nScott Lindquist - Chief Financial Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nCNA's fourth quarter core Income of $342 million is down 6% compared to the prior year quarter but continues to reflect strong underwriting and investment results. Full year 2024 core income of $1,316 million is a best on record leading to a core return on equity of 10.5% and reflects a record P&C underlying underwriting gain and net investment income growth of 10% as compared to 2023. Our P&C expense ratio was 30.0% for the fourth quarter and 30.2% for the full year. The expense ratio for both periods benefited from higher net earned premiums and continued expense discipline and also reflected continued investment in technology and talent. While there is always a certain amount of variability quarter to quarter, we currently believe an expense ratio of about 30.5% is a reasonable run rate heading into 2025. The P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was negligible in the current quarter. In the Specialty segment, prior period development was neutral overall, and this was mostly attributable to $22 million of favorable development in surety offset by $21 million of unfavorable development in professional and management liability mostly in accident years 2018 and prior. In the Commercial segment, prior period development was neutral overall with $96 million of favorable development in workers' compensation the majority of which is attributable to accident years 2018 and prior, $61 million of unfavorable development from continued pressure in commercial auto in recent accident years and $28 million of unfavorable development in general liability, the majority of which is attributable to accident years 2018 and prior. Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $91 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $76 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. The loss this quarter includes the results of our annual fourth 3 quarter asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) reserve review resulting in additional cessions of $103 million to the $4 billion loss portfolio transfer (LPT), which incepted in 2010. This strengthening of reserves is associated with higher defense and indemnity costs on existing claims. This review resulted in a non-economic, after-tax charge of $35 million as compared to a $24 million charge in the prior year quarter. Following this review, our cumulative incurred losses of $3.7 billion dollars remain within the $4 billion LPT limit while cumulative paid losses are $2.6 billion. Taking the average of the most recent three years of subject paid claims under the LPT against the remaining unpaid limit on the LPT results in a survival ratio of 9.5 years. You will recall from previous years' reviews that under retroactive reinsurance accounting, there is a timing difference with respect to recognizing the benefit of the cover relative to incurred losses as we can only do so in proportion to the paid losses recovered under the treaty. As such, holding all else constant, the loss recognized today will be recaptured over time through the amortization of the deferred accounting gain as paid losses ultimately catch up with incurred losses. As of year-end 2024, we have $425 million of deferred gain that will be recaptured over time. The Corporate segment results this quarter also include a $17 million after-tax charge related to unfavorable development for legacy mass tort abuse claims compared to a $12 million charge in the prior year quarter. The current quarter charge is in addition to $17 million and $28 million of after-tax mass tort charges in the third and second quarters of 2024, respectively, resulting in a full year 2024 after-tax mass tort charge of $62 million. As we have noted in prior calls, we perform our annual review of A&EP reserves during the fourth quarter, and we evaluate all other corporate segment reserves quarterly and will react as facts and circumstances warrant. For the Life & Group segment, we had core loss of $18 million in the fourth quarter as compared to core income of $4 million in the prior year quarter reflecting unfavorable morbidity experience. Life & Group full year core loss of $23 million is lower than the 2023 core loss of $48 million due to higher investment income. The full year 2024 underwriting result is about flat with 2023, with both full year results being broadly in-line with expectations. Finally, inforce management actions including pursuit of rate and policy buyouts are ongoing with 2,800 policy buyouts in 2024 for totaling $91 million with an after-tax expense impact of $6 million to core earnings. Net investment income was $644 million in the fourth quarter compared with $611 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 5%. The increase was driven almost equally by our fixed income and other investments as well as our limited partnership and common stock results. Fixed income and other investments generated $550 million of income, up 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Our A-rated fixed income portfolio continues to provide consistent contributions to core income, which have been steadily increasing because of favorable reinvestment rates and strong cash flow from operations. The effective income yield of our consolidated fixed income portfolio was 4.8% in the fourth quarter, up from 4.7% in the prior year q"

The effective income yield of our consolidated fixed income portfolio was 4.8% in the fourth quarter, up from 4.7% in the prior year quarter. Reinvestment rates continue to be above our P&C portfolio effective income yield of 4.4% and are slightly above our Life & Group portfolio effective income yield of 5.7%. Our limited partnership and common stock portfolio returned a $94 million gain, or 3.5%, in the current quarter compared to a $78 million gain, or 3.4%, in the prior year quarter. Total net investment income was a record best of $2,497 million for the full year 2024 compared with $2,264 million in 2023, an increase of 10%. Similar to the quarterly results, the increase was driven almost equally by our fixed income and other investments as well as our limited partnership and common stock results. Fixed income and other investments generated $2,177 million of income for the year, up 6% compared to the prior year. Limited partnerships and common stocks generated $320 million of income representing a 13.3% return compared to $202 million of income representing a return of 9.4% in the prior year. Looking ahead to 2025, based on the current interest rate environment we expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $550 million in the first quarter, which is about flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 given limited anticipated reinvestment activity. For the full year, we expect income from fixed income and other investments to be about $2,225 million, or a 2% increase as compared to the full year 2024. At quarter end, our balance sheet continues to be very solid with stockholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $12.5 billion, or $46.16 per share, an increase of 8% from year-end 2023 adjusting for dividends. Stockholders' equity including AOCI was $10.5 billion or $38.82 per share. With the increase in interest rates during the fourth quarter, the net unrealized investment loss in our fixed income portfolio increased to $2.3 billion as of year-end. Finally, we ended 2024 with statutory capital and surplus in the combined Continental Casualty Companies of $11.2 billion, which is up from $10.9 billion at the end of 2023. We continue to maintain a conservative capital structure with a low leverage ratio and a well-balanced debt maturity schedule. And we are pleased with the fourth quarter actions taken by AM Best and Moody's who both revised their outlooks on CNA's financial strength and debt ratings from stable to positive, which we view as recognition of the significant progress we have made in the performance of the business in recent years. Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong once again at $703 million and for the year, it increased 13% to a record best $2.6 billion reflecting both strong underwriting and investment results. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on core income for the fourth quarter was 20.1% and reflects a benefit for tax-exempt investment income, somewhat offset by state income taxes. The full year 2024 effective tax rate on core income was 20.9%, which is consistent with a 21% effective tax rate we expect for 2025, although there will be a certain amount of variability quarter-to-quarter. Finally, given the company's strong underwriting and investment performance, we are pleased to announce we are increasing our regular quarterly dividend 5% from $0.44 per share to $0.46 per share. In addition, we are declaring a special dividend of $2.00 per share, both to be paid on March 13, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 24, 2025.\n\nDouglas Worman - Chief Executive Officer (CNA Financial Corporation):\nBefore providing some concluding remarks on our results, I want to take the opportunity to convey, on behalf of the entire organization, our thanks to Dino Robusto. During his eight-year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, he led the Company to record levels of profitability and top quartile underwriting performance with incredible vision and tireless focus. I have been fortunate to work alongside him and am honored to have succeeded Dino in the CEO role, where my goal will be to continue executing the successful strategies we have developed and implemented over the last several years. I am excited to lead an incredible team of highly talented professionals as we work with our CNA colleagues across the entire enterprise to continue our laser focus on optimizing CNA's strategic direction, with the goal of continued top quartile performance. Our strong fourth quarter capped off a fantastic year in 2024. We achieved a record level of core income for the second consecutive year. Our P&C operations performed extremely well, reflecting the results of our strategic initiatives, with record underlying underwriting gains and robust all-in underwriting performance despite elevated catastrophes compared to the prior year. We achieved high single-digit growth in both gross written premiums excluding captives and net written premiums, along with a record volume of new business. The market dynamics across our segments and products are distinctly unique, requiring focused strategies, which we are successfully executing. Our loss cost trends remained stable this quarter, and we continue to achieve rate increases that exceed long-run loss cost trends in classes impacted by social inflation. As we look ahead, we anticipate a dynamic market with disciplined pricing in most business classes. Our relentless commitment to underwriting excellence and best-in-class execution ensures that CNA is well-positioned to navigate these dynamics to reinforce our market leadership and deliver sustained profitable growth.\n\nUnknown Executive - Executive Management (CNA Financial Corporation):\nWe invite shareholders and analysts to submit questions for management in advance of each quarter's earnings release. Below we address some questions we have received as well as some timely and topical focus areas for CNA and our industry."

We expect the growth in our long-term, fixed income portfolio to be closer to 4% in 2025, which is more comparable to the growth we saw in 2024."

The FX loss this quarter was driven by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the British pound during the quarter. Our Lloyd's syndicate has U.S. dollar insurance reserves that revalue to the syndicate's functional currency of the British pound through the income statement.

Berkley Corporation):\nEmma, thank you very much, and good afternoon to all participants. Thank you for finding time to join us this afternoon. Co-hosting with me today is Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman, as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are going to follow our typical agenda, where momentarily I'll be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some of the financial highlights from the quarter. Once he gets through his comments, he'll be handling it back to me. I will follow-up with a few of my own observations, and then the three of us will be available for Q&A to answer any questions people may have. So with that, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it. The company is off to a strong start with the first quarter of 2023 despite the significant catastrophe losses facing the industry. Our scale, specialization and disciplined management approach positioned us well to report an annualized return on equity of 17.4%. Contributions to this performance was reflected in both underwriting and investment income. The current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was a strong 87.7%, and investment income approached the record level achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by significant growth in our core portfolio investment income of more than 80%. The balance sheet also strengthened with stockholders' equity growing to a record level of more than $6.9 billion and book value per share increasing 3.7% in the quarter. The company returned almost $300 million of capital to shareholders through regular and special dividends, as well as share repurchases resulting in growth in book value per share before dividends and repurchases of 7.2%. The short duration in the fixed maturity investment portfolio of 2.4 years and high credit quality of AA-minus benefited unrealized investment losses by approximately $181 million. Continuing on investment performance. Net investment income increased almost 29% to $223 million. The income attributable to the core portfolio substantially increased due to a higher new money rate on fixed maturity securities compared to the roll off of existing investments. In addition, strong operating cash flow of approximately $445 million in the quarter, increased our investable assets, and will further contribute to growth in net investment income. The book yield has increased from 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 3.8% in the current quarter on fixed maturity securities. The investment funds reflected income of $2 million for the quarter, primarily arising from declines in market value in the financial services and consumer good sectors, partially offset by income from transportation and energy funds. Pretax net investment gains reflected an increase of $43 million in unrealized gains on equity securities, bringing our total unrealized gains approximately $114 million on the balance sheet. Equity investments in the technology sector drove the quarterly improvement. Partially offsetting these unrealized equity gains were losses recognized of approximately $21 million. Turning to underwriting results. Underwriting income was $234 million, which included current accident year catastrophe losses of $48 million or $1.9 loss ratio points and prior accident year unfavorable development of $24 million or one loss ratio point, principally from property catastrophe losses. Winter storms impacted both the current quarter and carried over from late loss activity in the fourth quarter of last year. This compares with catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2022 in the amount of $29 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. The calendar year loss ratio for first quarter of 2023 was 61.8%, and the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 58.9%. The growth in net premiums earned of almost 11% continues to benefit the expense ratio. However, a number of factors are causing the expense ratio to increase a half a point to $28.8%. First, the change in our reinsurance over the last year has lowered our ceding commissions on certain treaties where we've moved from proportional covers to excessive loss and/or reduced our quota share% ceded to reinsurance partners. In addition, increased compensation costs to new start up operating unit expenses are contributing to the higher expense ratio. We still expect our expense ratio to be comfortably below 30% as communicated on our fourth quarter call. Wrapping up with premium production, net premiums written grew by almost 7% to approximately $2.6 billion. The insurance segment grew 6.6% to $2.2 billion. And as you saw in the supplemental information on page seven of the earnings release, all lines of business improved with the exception of professional liability. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 7.1% to $363 million a record level for the segment with growth in all lines of business. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thanks very much. That was great. So let me provide a couple of observations through my lens. And then, again, as promised, we'll open it up for Q&A. So, upon reflection, certainly one of the things that we chat quite a bit about on our end of the phone is this, taking note of how clearly the cycle remains alive and well and the emotions and that drive the behaviors remain very much intact. But we continue to take note of a fact how major product lines, while they are still subject to the cyclical behavior, the fact of the matter is, they are clearly not in lockstep at all. And we've talked about this in the past, but it seems to be becoming more and more pronounced. So to that end, just a snapshot on how we're thinking about property. Clearly in, what I would suggest is, early stages of meaningful firming. From our perspective, it is a little bit disappointing as to the momentum that we saw on the insurance side when it comes to property in January. We saw a little bit more momentum in February. And quite frankly, March, we started to see real progress in April. I think there was meaningful traction as far as rate goes. While it perhaps is a little bit more pronounced or extreme on the CAT side, I would tell you these comments apply to non-CAT or risk exposure as well. Professional liability on the other hand, clearly, it's a very broad category and it is a mixed bag. I think on the miscellaneous D&O front, particularly written on an E&S basis, there is still great opportunity and we are making meaningful hay there. On the other hand, the D&O marketplace, particularly large account D&O, I would tell you for some number of quarters "

On the other hand, the D&O marketplace, particularly large account D&O, I would tell you for some number of quarters and it continues to be in the state of free fall as far as rate adequacy or pricing, if you will, and it is concerning to us. In addition to that, though a smaller line than D&O, I would tell you hospital professional liability is another product line where it's in desperate need of some discipline returning to the marketplace. Moving away from professional on to the topic of casualty. I would tell you that it seems from our perspective, there is also meaningful opportunity there, particularly in the E&S lines on the primary front and the excess front, particularly large accounts becoming more challenging. Clearly, a similar situation on the auto classes as well. Where Excess is becoming a bit more competitive and the primary there is competition but not as bad. I think the industry needs to be very careful with the professional casualty and auto, in particular, because they are notably susceptible to social inflation. And from our perspective, while there are signs that economic inflation is cooling a little bit from the heights that it reached, social inflation. There's really no sign or indication that we see that coming at all. Moving on to comp. Clearly continues to bounce along the bottom. One observation there historically or at least oftentimes California has lagged the rest of the market as far as where it stood in the cycle. There is some evidence that California is actually ahead of the rest of the market and showing potential signs of firming. Finally, reinsurance, I think there was a lot of excitement and discussion around affirming reinsurance market. Certainly from our perspective, the reinsurance market, particularly around property and property CAT has gained a meaningful level of additional discipline relative to where it's been in past years. That having been said, the casualty, somewhat disciplined and there are certain parts of the professional marketplace that had given us reason to pause. As we are just not seeing the ceding commissions coming down, even though we are seeing the pricing of the underlying erode. Pivoting over to us, a couple of sound bites, I think as Rich suggested, 17.4% return, great way to start the year in our opinion. The top line was impacted by what I would refer to as strong or excellent cycle management by our colleagues as we are deemphasizing certain product lines and leaning into other product lines. Just as a reminder, our priority is the bottom line. We are focused on building book value through a lens that we refer to as risk adjusted return. And we applaud the discipline and opportunistic approach that our colleagues operate with. On the topic of rate as we were touching earlier, clearly the rate was quite strong in the quarter, which we were pleased to see. The 8.3% ex-comp is the strongest that we've seen on the rate front since this time last year or same time last year. Additionally, I would mention that the renewal retention ratio still is hanging in there around 80%, which as we've mentioned in the past, we think it's an important data point, because it reminds us that we are not churning the book, but it actually the rate we are getting is sticking, we are not changing the quality or integrity of the book, important thing again. I guess finally just on the 8.3%, I think by any measure, we are comfortably outpacing trend. And I think it is likely that you will see that coming through in our loss ratios over time. Even with the CAT activity, the 90.6% combined, I think is quite attractive. If you're [about] (ph) four person, which I am not, it would have been an 87.7%. Obviously, the difference, as Rich alluded to and you would have picked up in the release was two things. One, obviously, the CATs that we had during the period, which equated to approximately 1.9 points and then we had a point of negative development. Now before anyone gets too carried away with the negative development, it was essentially driven by property and property CAT losses that happened during the fourth quarter. And as people will recall, some of that CAT activity happened late in the fourth quarter, and we just didn't have our arms fully around it. So please don't misconstrue the development for being something different than it really is. Paid loss ratio, 48 and changed. I think people will presumably continue to take note of the delta between the paid versus what we are booking the loss ratio to. We get questions from time to time, given how well the paid loss ratio has been running relative what we -- the loss ratio picks that we are carrying, when are those going to converge? And I would tell you that, it's coming. In my opinion, I think there's a reality for the industry and we are not completely insulated from it. 2016 through 2019 was a challenging period of time. I think that we have been cautious and measured as to how quickly we want to recognize the progress that was made 2020 and more recent than that. But I think that's coming. I think it's going to come more into focus as we make our way through this year into next year and likely we'll have implications for the lost picks that we are carrying in the more recent years and also how we think about current year lost picks. Rich touched on the expense ratio, the 28.8%. As he suggested, partly driven by new business initiatives, partly driven by some investments that we are making, particularly on the technology front. And finally some shifts that we are making on the reinsurance as he alluded to. The [seed] (ph) on something proportional or quota share, obviously, is very different than an [XOL] (ph). And while we are very keen for our reinsurance partners to make a reasonable return, we are unaccepting of being inappropriately gouged and we will use our flexibility as appropriate. Pivoting over -- excuse me, to the investment portfolio. Without a doubt, a lot of momentum there. I think we've discussed it in some detail in the past. You can kind of see it coming our way. I think there is more opportunity from here. The duration of 2.4 years, I think we are looking opportunistically to nudge that out. I don't think we're going to move the needle dramatically overnight, but certainly our hope is that there will be windows of opportunity to nudge that out a little bit. The book yield at 3.8% is notably below where the new money rate is. So our best guesstimate that a new money rate today is sort of between 4.25%, 4.5%. So you can do the math as to the upside there. Rich touched on the funds. We had a little bit of noise in the quarter, not a complete surprise. By and large, it was stemming from some private equity funds that we participate in. We feel like we have clarity around it and it is our expectation that going forward funds performance more likely than not will turn to sort of that range of between $20 million and $50 million a quarter. So long story short, 17.4% return, combined ratio of a 90.6% with some CAT activity, both in the quarter and a bit spilling over from Q4 2022. Rate increases, robust as effort. And of course, the new money rate, 50 basis points plus upside relative to the book yield, I think all those things put together are very encouraging. To the extent you're [indiscernible] person, which I am not again 87.7% would deliver you a 20% plus return. So I think that was more than enough from me. Why don't we, Emma, go ahead and open it up for Q&A, please."

Good afternoon. I guess first question on some of the premium growth changes. It looks like some of the growth rates were somewhat notable in the insurance segment, especially with workers comp growing a lot and some other lines as well. And then -- you know the numbers better than me. Anything you want to call out why workers comp's growing so fast, the California comment or some of the lines that were shrinking a bit?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, as far as comp goes, Rich, correct me if I'm wrong. I think we were kind of flattish. I think we went from $303 million in the quarter to $310 million, which isn't a large uptick. That having been said, I would tell you it's mainly payrolls. Certainly, we're getting a little bit of traction from our new initiative in California. But what would be driving it more than anything else would be. I think we all have an appreciation for where a wage inflation has been going as of late. And we're picking that up, whether it be in initially or coming through in the audits afterwards. Rich. Am I correct on that?\n\nRichard Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. On the primary side, that's right, Rob.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. My bad. I think I looked at [still] (ph) number. So I'll do my best to ask a better follow-up question. So, on the investment portfolio, we've gotten a lot of questions about commercial real estate. Clearly, W. R. Berkley has an excellent track record, but any stats you want to offer additional color on Berkley\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio, such as maybe LTVs or anything you think we be thinking about that could be helpful?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, there's a couple of things there, Mike. First of all, I would -- these buildings, much of it is unleveraged. So as far as the whole loan to value thing. I think the other piece is that, we are very comfortable with the occupancy rate. And we're also comfortable with the credit of the tenants. And as you'd expect, it's something that we pay attention to. So the occupancy rate, the credit of the tenants and the duration of the leases, we think we're in a fine spot.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. And lastly, I guess, looking at you're -- thinking about your prepared remarks, it -- when looking at the growth rate trend, it feels like there's a number of puts and takes. I mean, it sounds like guarded optimism. Any help in kind of think of the top line.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. Let me try and give you a little bit more color from my perspective without boring you or anyone else too much. The fact is that, from an underwriting perspective, we're focused on the margin. And it's when we see what's going on, for example, in the D&O market, we are not going to follow that down the drain. My expectation, which I think will prove to be right, it's just taking longer than anticipated, you are going to see us on the property side be able to flex up a bit. January, as I mentioned, was disappointing. February, maybe we saw a couple of green shoots, March was encouraging and April so far, there's visible traction. So, we have a diverse book of, what I would define as specialty insurance. As I tried to allude to earlier various products, they don't march in lockstep. If we were a mono line player, the peaks would be high and the valleys would be lower. But because of the diversity and how the cycle has decoupled by product, it's a more stable ship. My best guess is that, you're likely going to see our growth rate tick up as we make our way into this -- it could be in the second quarter, but certainly as we make our way into the second half of the year. I think you're going to see us writing some more property. I think you're going to see our momentum continue to build with some of our E&S casualty. I think you're going to start to see some of the comp lines bottoming out. I think you're going to see the D&O market at some point, it's going to -- at least the erosion will slow. So my best estimate is that, you're going to see the growth rate tick up certainly in the second half of the year based on what I can ascertain. And it could tick up a bit in in Q2.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

My first question, can you just provide a little bit more color on what drove the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio, deterioration, and insurance? And how should we think about the balance of the year, given your design ratio concept?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo I think probably the biggest driver there would be non-CAT property related losses, Elyse. And I think we had alluded to in prior calls that we had been looking at this. I think there are a couple of things that needed to be tightened up. They are being tightened up, and I think that pig is making its way through the python at this stage. But I think that would be the bigger driver -- biggest driver of non-CAT property.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd how large were the non-CAT property losses? Or is that the sole driver of the year over year deterioration in the underlying loss ratio and insurance?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have the exact number in front of me, but that was a big contributor.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then, following up, I guess, on the growth question. It sounds like you expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year. You guys used to talk about double digit growth, and I recognize there's a lot of moving pieces. If everything plays out the way that you expect, Rob, I mean, do you think you'd be back to seeing double digit growth in the back half of the year?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThat's what we would like to see. Obviously, we're going to -- we'll see if the D&O market continues to erode. Akin to the D&O market is transactional liability, which has kind of hit a wall, which has had an impact as well. In addition to that, just getting a little deeper into it at least, there were a couple of relationships that we had, specifically in the commercial auto space where we had a different view than our partners do around rate adequacy. And as a result of that, we've gone our separate ways. And then other areas within professional liability, as I alluded to earlier, we just have a view as to inflation and social inflation. And the cost or the price that you pay for trying to be on top of it is sometimes you're early or ahead of the market. And eventually, more often than not, they will catch up. But the benefit of that is, you don't have the same level of pain that you have to deal with in the future. So long story short, I think we have many, many parts of our business growing at a very high growth rate. Certainly well north of the 10% that you talked about. There are some parts of the business where, to my colleagues credit, they are operating with the appropriate level of discipline. They recognize they can't control the marketplace, they can control their own actions, and we appreciate and applaud what they're doing. But when you put it all together, what comes out in the wash is, I think more likely than not, you're going to see our growth rate tick up from here in the second half of the year.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And one last quick one. Am I right in assuming that the adverse development, the property CAT that, that all was in your insurance segment in the quarter?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

Berkley Corporation):\nHi, Josh [Multiple Speakers]\n\nJosh Shanker  - Analyst (Bank of America):\nGood evening and good afternoon. At the risk of speaking on behalf of the [indiscernible] people, I was wondering -- look, if we go to the last cycle, obviously, things are never the same. But at the end of 2004, 2005, 2006, I don't know when you want to put the end of the last cycle, it turned out that pricing was so adequate that although some people pulled back, you really had another healthy five, maybe longer, years to write stuff that was very attractive. And maybe the less learned was that we should have been more aggressive. I don't know, maybe that wasn't the lesson learned, and there was a lot of opportunity even as pricing cooled off. We have from, I guess, the 2019 through 2021, 2022 cycle, pricing has cooled off. And it looks like maybe there will be some property [indiscernible] but things have changed really, really quickly. Where I'm going with this is, has the industry changed that you're always going to be following the loss costs that everything has gotten more technical and more advanced in a way that there's not a extended period of excess pricing where the insurance companies are allowed to flex their muscles a little bit and gain mixes earnings? Or are you as a company and the industry is always going to be tied to the pricing and the loss trend, such that it's going to be tight going into the years to come, if that makes any sense?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think I follow, Josh. And if I'm not answering the question, then please stop me in my tracks, and we'll have another crack at it. But I think the answer is that, there's more data, there's more analysis, the more technical, so on and so forth in the industry today than there was yesterday. That having been said, in spite of all of that, I think there continues to be examples that would suggest the industry continues to struggle with getting its arms around its loss costs in a timely manner. We can look at what has happened to the reinsurance marketplace over the relatively past -- recent past years. We can look at workers' compensation, where clearly it proves even more recently to be much more profitable than people had anticipated. So is there more data analytics and so on involved? Yes, sir, I believe there is. Is it proving to be the silver bullet or the Holy Grail? I think there's a lot of data as of late that would suggest it's not, and it remains a struggle. So that would be my perspective. Not to beat the topic up too much. I think one of the big differences these days is, again, how separate and distinct major product lines are from one another where they are in the cycle. And the implications for that, what that means to organization's overall profitability and how that may impact their behavior, we'll have to see with time. So I don't know if I answered your question.\n\nJosh Shanker  - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd so -- yes, I mean -- here's where I'm going. The growth wasn't -- with obviously single digits, you're only get back to double digits. You have the best pricing ex workers' comp that you've had in a number of cores at 8.3%. It doesn't feel like with 8.3% that you're so excited to lean into it just yet. Even though you're saying, look, you're going to see that margin come through in the next few quarters, if it were at 8.3%, I would think that you feel pretty good about things, and we'd already be at the double digit. I'm not telling you how to run your business, but it just seems like that you're already cautious about that.\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo, I appreciate the observation. And when you first started to ask your question, I was wondering whether you've been sitting in on some of our staff meetings, because the point that you're raising is one of the important points that we grapple with. And that is, how do we make sure that we're appropriately forward-looking and that we don't tap the brake prematurely at the same time, how do we make sure in an effort to not tap it prematurely, we don't wait too long to address changes in the market. And I agree with your point about the 8.3% is very healthy, and we are very much encouraged by that. That having been said: one, as I think you have an appreciation for, we are focused on underwriting margin. We are sensitive to social inflation. We see the claims that the industry is facing every day. Many people read about them in the paper and the trajectory is quite steep. And we don't want to get caught flat-footed. I think our growth rate was adversely impacted by a handful, if you will, or so of operating units -- handful and half of operating companies that are in the group, where market conditions became so challenging. And so less attractive than they were that they drew a line in the sand and that had an impact. In addition to that, sometimes we have a different view than distribution does, as I was suggesting earlier, around rate adequacy. Our obligation is to many stakeholders, including our shareholders, and we are not going to consciously expose the capital unless we believe the rate is appropriate. I think much of what I'm referring to as far as the headwinds we faced, I don't think that they are necessarily going to continue to blow and certainly will not below as hard in the second half of the year as they did in the first quarter. And as a result of that, I think the other product lines you're going to see them continue to lift us. And the drag will be reduced.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAll right. I appreciate the fulsome answers. If there is time I may more akin questions, but I\u2019ll let somebody have a chance. Thank you.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):"

So yes the first question, I guess, you mentioned that the property losses again hit you quarter and you seem to have your hands around that issue. But are you expecting potentially losses to stay elevated there for the time being, like as you're fixing that book or...\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLook, I can't say with any conviction or certainty, Ryan, how quickly that's going to get back to where we would like it to. What I can tell you is, I think we're getting our arms around it. It takes a little bit of time for that to earn through. The other point as it relates to the accident year loss ratio, which I know is a topic that I've had the opportunity to visit with you about is how we think about the current year in light of the rate increases that we have gotten. And I would tell you that I think the challenges that the industry and again, lead to a certain extent, faced 2016 through 2019 are shrinking in the rearview mirror. And I think the more recent years every quarter, every day, season a little bit more, and that could have implications to how we think about loss picks for the second half of the year.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then on the expense ratio, it was [sub-29] (ph). I heard Rich say you expect it to be sub-30 for the rest of the year. Is that just sort of a generic comment or can you try to say the expense ratio tick up from here?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think what we're trying to say is that the expense ratio is going to float sort of between 28% and 30%. We don't have it down to the basis point, if you will. The tick up that you've seen in part, as Rich mentioned earlier, some of it actually has to do with sort of the people traveling and engaging a bit more. There's some of that. The other part, as he indirectly referenced is, we're making some investments in technology as well. And of course, the ceding commissions which sometimes the cedes are going down with existing structures, but also as Rich suggested, which is often the case, we're pivoting from a quota share to an XOL, which carries a different ceding commission, but we like the trade.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then just lastly, Rob, on the buyback, can you give us some color on the timing of when you guys do those repurchases? And have you guys been in the market at all during April?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo as far as the repurchase goes to be, perfectly frank, I don't have the data in front of me, but we'd be happy to try and give you some more color if it wouldn't be too much trouble to circle back with Rich or Karen. Or if you can't find them, grab me off-line, and we'll do the best we can to give you some color on that, but I don't have it in front of me.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

I'm just -- I'm curious whether that's something you think is going to reaccelerate as the year progresses? And if I might ask kind of what were you seeing in pricing trends in that liability line in Q1 versus Q4?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. I think the -- generally speaking, the most attractive areas that we're seeing is particularly in the E&S. And I should have mentioned this earlier, Mark, I appreciate you raising it. The flow of business that we talk about from time to time coming out of the standard market into the E&S market remains quite robust to say the least. And we're feeling very good about that. The one outlier would be product liability, where it would seem the standard market, particularly national carriers have regained a bit of an appetite. But beyond that, we're feeling really good. I think you should see some growth or accelerating growth potentially later in the year on the other liability front as far as we go.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist):\nAnd then the noninsurance businesses, the revenue was up pretty meaningfully this quarter.

R. Berkley Corporation):\nAlex, from our perspective, as I hope you're aware, we're an opportunistic participant. We're certainly conscious of the challenges that the real estate asset class faces today. And we are, again, not going to do anything that one would view as naive. At the same time, if we found attractive opportunities that we thought made sense for our shareholders, then I can assure you that we will be pursuing.

Why is it that we wouldn't see the ceding ratio go down a bit as a result of that? I think it was pretty stable year-over-year?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, do you want to speak to that? We were just talking about it earlier.\n\nRichard Baio  - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure. So when we move to the excess of loss, we don't technically receive ceding commissions, right. On a quota share basis, you're going to receive ceding commissions. On an excess of loss basis, we're going to have minimums in deposits and cost based on subject premium. Those numbers are going to be more, I'll say, fixed in nature as opposed to quota shares, which are proportional. And so these are going to move in parity, if you will, as gross premiums written move up or down. And so for that reason, the ceded premium would not be moving up and down by being in a position where we have the excess of loss arrangements. So that's causing that change. And I think you could see that when you look at the change from a dollars perspective, gross premiums written grew at 6.6% for the group overall. The net premiums written grew at 6.7% and the ceded written premium changed by about 6.2%. So it kind of moved in parity, if you will. But that's -- once again, we have over 125 reinsurance arrangements that we purchased across the group overall, and there's a lot of moving pieces between them.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nOkay. I may follow up off-line, because I'm still a little confused here. And then my second question, Rob, I think you may have alluded to some seasoning of the 2020 and 2021 accident years and just the very strong environment that you faced in those years. Is that why we're starting to see maybe an acceleration of releases in some of the longer tail lines, such as other liability from 2020 and 2021?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nQuite frankly, as things, to your point, season out, we developed, through the passage of time, greater comfort, greater clarity around where things are going to settle. And we deliberately did not want to declare victory prematurely. And I think, again, as time continues to pass, you're going to see us develop a greater degree of confidence as to what the outcomes are going to be in some of these more recent years.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nRight. I'm just -- I guess, I'm coming out from a slightly different perspective. It seems to me like we're seeing some acceleration of that favorable development from those years relatively early, considering that we're a year or two out for these longer tail lines. So is that just because the number -- the years were so incredibly good that you are gaining that comfort level sooner?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think the answer is that we have -- we've gone through a pretty extensive analysis that we'd be happy to talk with you about off-line, but it probably would take up quite a bit of time.

R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo, nothing that would be outside of the loss ratio picks that we're carrying for the product lines. We've -- will we have some exposure? Yes, but relative to the group overall, it's just kind of flows through.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nMakes sense. And I guess my second question is, as we look at -- you're looking into 2023 here, did you change your view at all on loss trend as you look into 2023, particularly given your comments maybe in commercial and auto? And then also, if I look at your 1Q 2023, you talked about the non-CAT weather issues. Did you change your casualty loss picks year-over-year, did they go up, down, stay the same from a casualty perspective kind of overall?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo we, with some regularity, are looking at our picks and trying to make sure that they're where they should be. The answer is, Brian, that some move up and some move down depending on the data, we look at the business at a pretty granular level by operating company, by product line. So I don't have off the top of my head exactly what the net impact was, but there are certainly some things that we've ticked up and maybe a couple of things that we've dropped.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nAnd loss trends, any thoughts?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAs far as loss trend goes, if our -- the view that we had, generally speaking, around loss trend that we entered the year with remains intact. It certainly -- we appreciate that maybe economic inflation has cooled a little bit, but we remain very concerned about social inflation. And we think we're in a good place relative to that. But we don't think that this is the moment in time to reduce the focus, the intensity and making sure that we're getting -- collecting enough premium to keep up with that trend.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

You talked about workers' compensation largely growing through, I guess, higher payrolls. Can you talk about what's driving the commercial auto growth? I'm asking because the sense we're getting is that, there's still an awful lot of either social inflation or driver shortages that would pressure the line. I hope you could talk through what you're seeing.\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe commercial auto line and the growth that we are seeing is really a combination -- it's primarily -- a lot of it's rate for starters. I don't recall exactly how much rate we got in that product line, but it was meaningful, particularly on the auto liability front, but across the board. So I think that is really the bigger driver when you look at the growth. In addition to that, we do have a new operation in the space, and they're getting some momentum as well. But for the most part, I think what you're seeing as far as the commercial auto growth, a lot of that is really just driven by rate increases.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. That's good to hear. And then second question, I don't know if this is better for Rich, when you talked about the impact of changing reinsurance on the expense ratio. Should we see some sort of benefit in the loss ratio to the extent that you're moving reinsurance to XOL from quota share?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe answer is that we think that it's going to -- what you're going to see is we're going to hold on to more premium. And we think that the loss ratio is healthy. But I don't think you're going to see that benefit immediately because of how we assume a recovery or not. Rich, did you have anything you wanted to add to that?\n\nRichard Baio  - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo. I think that was exactly spot on, Rob.

So just -- I had just a question just on the non-CAT property losses this quarter. I think there were fire losses last quarter when you had it. Wondering if you could elaborate or was it fire again? And then maybe talk about what changes outside of just seeking additional rate you're making to address these? And if this impacted your approach at all to growing property?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo the answer is that, certainly fire and other non-CAT related losses were a meaningful piece of the puzzle. While rate helps solve the puzzle, the -- I think part of the solution is also coming from selection. The work that I referred to that colleagues have done on this front. Certainly, again, rate is a piece of it, but I think it's even more so about selection. Was there another piece that I missed? Sorry.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nYes. And then I guess just there is -- we've seen it in the past few quarters in the underlying or in the accident year loss ratio ex-CAT as well as in the CAT line, I guess, as well as, adverse PYD this quarter. But is this volatility? I guess, how are you viewing this? Has this impacted your approach to growing property at all?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it hasn't necessarily had a blanket impact on us as to how we think about growing property, but it certainly has been instructive as we've done some work as to how we think about rate and selection.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned a few times throughout the call, Rob, just there are certain product lines that you're deemphasizing, a few operating units where you had to draw a line in the sand. Outside of -- could you just touch on what lines those are?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure. There was -- some of -- it's a little bit anecdotal, so I would encourage you not to read too deeply into it. But certainly, there was some other professional liability that we took a firm -- or we have taken a firm position on, again, to my colleague's credit. Some of that is written out of the U.S., some of it is written out of our Lloyd's operation. In addition to that, we've taken a bit of a firm position on certain assets of our participation in the commercial transportation space, where, again, as I suggested earlier, we just have a different view than our distribution partners did around rate adequacy amongst other things. And that's life, and we wish them well. But professional and commercial auto would be the two big areas that come to mind.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore):\nGot it. Thanks. And then maybe just a higher level question just on social inflation. You've mentioned it a number of times and potential problems looming for the industry on 2019 and prior years. I guess just by your estimation, how far along are we in terms of seeing some of the courts reopen? And maybe some of those claims actually come through and actually see that starting to hit some of the carriers and just the industry overall?\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. So certainly, from our perspective, by and large, the legal system is up. And I almost said functioning, I really should say, running because I'm not sure if it's always functioning. But the short answer is, I think the general consensus on -- in our shop. And again, it varies by jurisdiction. But there's probably still, call it, give or take, an 18-month delay relative to where things were pre-COVID. And I think people are trying to catch up. But I think beyond the delay, I think it would be a mistake for anyone to underestimate how aggressive the plaintiff bar is these days. And oftentimes, people read about some monster headline and they think of it -- some monster award in a headline, I should say. And they think about it in a one-off manner. And I would suggest that oftentimes, that's just the tip of the spear. So it's a very challenging moment. We feel very good about how we have approached making sure that we have set enough aside for what claims cost will be both today and tomorrow. And we think our colleagues that are handling these claims are very well skilled to ensure the appropriate outcome for all stakeholders, including our insureds.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

I\u2019m just curious, if anything, other than increased data analytics has caused the pricing environment to maybe [indiscernible] is not the right word, but to change pretty fast in a number of lines of business. You've said a number of times how the market is not moving in lockstep. Is anything like a structural change with broker consolidation or just maybe barriers to entry are lower on the -- I'll be quiet, but on the Marsh call today, for example, they talked about 20 new carriers entering the professional liability space, which has caused the soft market there. So just curious if anything has changed or this is just how it always used to be.\n\nRobert Berkley  - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. I think just picking up on that point, if I may, if we use public D&O, particularly large account public D&O, which is certainly a product line that is of great interest to an organization like Marsh. I think there are a couple of realities in that and what I mean by that is, both the supply and the demand side are struggling. So I don't know if the number is 20, but clearly, there have been a lot of new entrants. I think some of the reality is, there's not a lot of barriers to entry to getting into that space. So clearly, there's more supply. I think the bigger issue relative to where we were not that long ago is the reduced demand. Given what's been going on in the capital markets, we have seen a dramatic reduction in IPOs. We've just seen a dramatic reduction in a lot of the activity that would drive D&O purchasing. In addition to that, transactional liability is something that tends to go hand-in-hand with those that are offering D&O. So M&A activity has reduced dramatically IPOs, SPAC activity, et cetera, et cetera, has fallen off a cliff. So you have a little bit of a perfect storm. And not to create too much of a negative connotation, but the reality is that the demand has been reduced and the supply has increased, and that has led to an unattractive competitive environment from our perspective. Our colleagues, I think, as I suggested earlier, very knowledgeable, very skilled. They understand that their job is not to issue insurance policies they are capital managers, and they are going to expose the capital in ways that they think is sensible.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Along with me on this end of the phone, we also have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, as well as Chief Financial Officer, Rich Baio. And we're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'm going to hand it over to Rich, who will walk us through some highlights from the quarter. I will follow up with a few observations after Rich makes his comments and then we will be opening it up for Q&A. Before I hand it over to Rich, a few comments from me. Based on everything, I can see -- it would look as though the stage is being set for what one might call yet another but-for quarter for the industry. It would seem as though cat losses don't make a difference. And bizarrely, from our perspective, people seem very quick to back out cat losses as though it's not real money. But ironically, they don't seem to back out the premium associated with the exposure that just had the losses. So again, from our perspective, it's no wonder why the industry struggles oftentimes to make good risk-adjusted returns. In order to do that, one needs to recognize the exposure taking on and not pretend that it doesn't exist, particularly when it occurs. Through our lens, we are in the capital management business. We are focused on risk-adjusted returns and around here, cat losses count. In our opinion, it is not Monopoly money. It is real money. And when we measure how we are doing, we do not back out cat losses. Perhaps we are a bit of an exception to the industry but ultimately, we think it is an economic reality and that's not something we shy away from. So with that, Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRichard Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOf course. Thanks, Rob. Net income doubled from the prior year quarter, resulting in $356 million or $1.30 per share. Annualized return on beginning of year equity was 21.1%, driven by strong underwriting and record investment income results. Operating return on equity was excellent at 18.4% and the heightened industry-wide catastrophe activity in the quarter enabled us to once again demonstrate our underwriting discipline in challenging environments. Simultaneously, our decision to maintain a short duration, high credit quality investment portfolio has enabled us to benefit from higher interest rates. Net investment income increased almost 43% to a record $245 million. The core investment portfolio grew 71.6%, driven by a higher book yield at 4.2% in the quarter compared with the preceding consecutive quarter of 3.8% and second quarter of 2022 of 2.6%. Second quarter operating cash flows of $709 million, combined with the first quarter, brings us to a first half year record of almost $1.2 billion and strengthens our ability to grow investable assets at higher interest rates. A duration of 2.3 years also positions us well to reinvest assets at a higher new money rate on fixed maturity securities compared to the roll-off of existing investments while maintaining our high credit quality of AA-. The investment funds reflected a loss of $1 million, driven by a decline in market values in certain funds in the consumer goods, real estate and financial services sectors. Please keep in mind that we report our investment funds on a 1-quarter lag. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $59 million is comprised of net realized gains on investments of $47 million and an improvement in unrealized gains on equity securities of $21 million, partially offset by an increase in current expected credit losses of $10 million. Turning to underwriting results. Underwriting income was $265 million, representing a calendar year combined ratio of 89.6%. Current accident year catastrophe losses were $54 million or 2.1 loss ratio points compared with the prior year of $58 million or 2.5 loss ratio points. Prior year development was favorable by $3 million or 0.1 loss ratio points, bringing our current accident year combined ratio ex cats to 87.6%. Current accident year loss ratio ex cats was 59.5%. The expense ratio ticked up 0.4 points to 28.1% in the quarter, consistent with the expectations we previously communicated. The 2 main contributors include the change in reinsurance structures as well as increased compensation costs and start-up operating unit expenses. We're working hard to identify and implement innovative strategies to drive operating efficiencies and leverage technology in order to reduce operating expenses across the entire organization. Closing out the underwriting discussion with premium production. We increased gross premiums written by 9.3% to a record $3.3 billion and net premiums written increased 8.7% to a record $2.8 billion. All lines of business grew in the Insurance segment, with the exception of professional liability and workers' compensation, while property reinsurance grew in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment. Stockholders' equity remained strong at almost $6.9 billion after returning more than $320 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. We repurchased almost 5.1 million shares for $292.5 million at an average price per share in the quarter of $57.79. In addition, we paid regular dividends of $28.3 million. The combination of these capital-related actions for the first quarter including the special dividend translates to $614.5 million returned to investors on a year-to-date basis or 9.1% of the beginning of year stockholders' equity. Rob, I'll turn it back to you. Thanks.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thank you very much. Very helpful. So look, I think the market continues to not operate in any type of lockstep where major lines, as we've discussed in the past, continue to somewhat march to the beat of their own drum. In addition to that, we continue to see the marketplace struggling with trying to strike the balance between rate need and keeping up with loss cost trend, on the other hand, a desire to grow. This is an industry where you can, practically speaking, grow as quickly as you want to. It really becomes a much more challenging exercise, though, when you were looking to achieve a certain loss ratio which will deliver a return that is acceptable in the end. For us, rate adequacy to support a reasonable loss ratio and deliver an acceptable return has, is and will remain a priority for us. I believe that this has been demonstrated over time through our results and, obviously, our continued focus on making sure that we are keeping up with trend comfortably. A couple of soundbites on the marketplace and major product lines. And I would hope it will dovetail in with some of Rich's comments and where we hav"

And I would hope it will dovetail in with some of Rich's comments and where we have been growing and parts of the marketplace that we find less attractive and we're playing a bit more defense. For starters, speaking of defense, I think public D&O within the professional line space is clearly a place that one needs to pause and tread carefully. We are seeing the pricing erode at a very rapid pace. Clearly, there has been good margin in the business but that seems to be whittling away quite quickly. As far as liability lines and maybe under the umbrella of social inflation, we continue, particularly in the auto space or especially commercial auto, to see great challenge. That's also spilling over into GL and, ultimately, umbrella. And what I mean by that is the plaintiffs' bar is very aggressive and they are taking a variety of new tactics. We think that we are able to keep up with it appropriately through terms, conditions, attachment points and, of course, pricing. But it is not lost on us that it is a challenging moment and requires one pay close attention. In addition to that, there is growing evidence that the tail associated with some of these product lines maybe extending a little bit, particularly on the claims -- excuse me, on the occurrence front and to a certain extent, on certain aspects of the claims made upfront. Property, I think it has finally come into focus what needed to happen as it relates to cat-exposed properties and that seems to be spilling over into the non-cat or risk property account where additional rate is required. The other piece that's worth mentioning, at least through, in my opinion, is Tier 2 cat which I would define as severe convective storm, wildfire, winter storm, etcetera. These are things that were a bit of an afterthought. And I think after the past several years, they are becoming much more front of mind. Last comment as it relates to market conditions would be workers' compensation, certainly a topic we have discussed on these calls in the past. There was a period of time during COVID, where clearly, there was a break that was caught on the frequency front for the industry. Frequency has returned to a more traditional norm but one of the things that we've been waiting for and we're starting to finally see rear its head is medical inflation. It is our expectation that you are going to see more medical inflation coming through to all payers, including the workers' comp space. And as a reminder, slightly over 50% of every claims dollar associated with workers' compensation stems from medical. So again, we can get into more details on that to the extent people are interested later on. Last comment on the marketplace. There continues to be this bifurcation between where the standard market, particularly national carriers, have an appetite. They seem to be very aggressive. But where they don't have an appetite, that is creating great opportunity for the specialty, in particular, the E&S space. The submission flow that we continue to see remains robust and we are very encouraged with what the balance of the year likely holds and beyond. And certainly, the early returns on July are positive. Rich talked about the top line. Obviously, we benefited from the rate increases that we continue to get, the ex comp rate increase during the quarter was 8.2% which was reasonably consistent with what we saw earlier this year. I think the loss ratio demonstrates, yet again, our strategy around how we manage exposure, how we have balance in the portfolio and how we think about risk and return. And certainly volatility is folded into that and, in our opinion, is a key component in building book value. As far as the expenses go, Rich touched on that as well. We remain very focused on making sure we're thoughtful about the dollars that we spend and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that number won't remain comfortably below 30. And pivoting over to the investment portfolio, we remain -- we continue, I should say, excuse me, to be rewarded for the position that we took as it relates to duration. Obviously, as we've discussed in the past, we benefited in having less of an adverse impact on our book value as rates moved up. And in addition to that, we were able to put money to work at higher rates more quickly than many of our peers. The new money rate in the quarter was probably around 5.25%-plus and as you would gather, relative to the book yield at 4.2%, that would suggest we still have significant upside and that will come into focus over some period of time. Rich mentioned the duration at 2.3, I think it was at 2.4 last quarter. Just to clarify that, that was really as much as anything, just rounding. That having been said, we are paying close attention, as you would expect, for the window of opportunity; and when it presents itself, likely you'll see that duration start to push out again. So all things being equal, I think a very solid quarter for us on virtually every front. I think when you take into account the cat activity that the industry faced, we fared particularly well. And in spite of that, our ability to generate a 21% return, I think, is really a great positive and a tribute to our colleagues and to our strategy and how effectively they are executing. When the day is all done, the goal of the exercise is to build book value. There is no question that is the goal. Ultimately, it's when building book value, it is not just about the steps you take forward. It is also about the steps you take -- that you avoid taking backwards. So with that, Breanna, we'd be very pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

I was just curious if there was anything one-off in that number. I know the last couple of quarters, we've seen some elevated non-cat fire losses that you guys have called out. Was there -- were there any similar losses in the quarter or anything within that 87.6% we think about the level of margin we could see in the balance of the year?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThat pig is still making its way through the python. I don't have a specific number for how much it contributed but it is reducing, if you will but it did play a role. I think the other piece is just general mix as well in the portfolio. As you can see, it shifts a little bit every day as far as the underwriting portfolio. But yes, there was a little bit of non-cat property in there but it is diminishing.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then in terms of the mix, right? So your rate ex comp in the quarter was 8.2, right? We can call that stable with the 8.3 last quarter. And I would have thought, like given we've heard of a lot of strength within property in the quarter that you might have seen the rates move up a little bit. Is that just a function of mix?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. I think it's a function of mix. And certainly, we are benefiting as much as anyone on the property front. At the same time, there are clearly challenges for workers' compensation. And you can see that and, quite frankly, how much we are growing or not there. And on the professional liability side, as Rich flagged as well, D&O is very competitive. So the number that we give you is an aggregate, obviously but I can promise you that we are getting good traction on the property front. And the more cat exposed it is, the more traction we are getting and it's significant.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then one last one. The PYD, you guys said was favorable $3 million. I know you guys typically wait for the Q to give insurance versus reinsurance. But could you give us a sense of the magnitude in one segment versus the other?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nHonestly, relative to the reserve position in both, it was de minimis. I think one -- I don't have the number exactly in front of me but one was a little bit positive and one was a little, I think, modestly negative, if bad [ph]."

Can you talk about why you didn't feel like you needed to make adjustments, sort of confidence in those reserves despite some of those headwinds that you see?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe answer is because a lot of what you -- I was referencing and you just referenced are things that we have been anticipating. And when people have been asking us, why aren't you dropping your current accident year? Why aren't you dropping your loss ratios? Because there's a lot of uncertainty out there. So we feel very comfortable about where we sit at this stage. We revisit and look at our loss ratios by product line at a very granular level with some regularity, that being every 90 days. And we think we are in a good place to be able to absorb what we are seeing.\n\nAlex Scott - Equity Research Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. And then a follow-up, maybe just a high-level question on excess and surplus versus standard lines. I know in the past you've talked about standard lines and a lot of things going over; I mean we're certainly hearing about it in personal lines.

There's a lot of momentum out there not just in the property but in the liability, including pockets of professional. That's why I called out D&O, in particular, because that is a particularly challenged line. That's why I called out workers' comp. It has been very competitive for an extended period of time. But much of the rest of what we do, we are seeing very strong submission flow."

So are you saying that some current year property losses led into the underlying -- this -- from last quarter to this quarter? Because I thought you used that term when we're talking about kind of a reserve tail.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo. What I'm talking about is that during the quarter, there was some non-cat property losses that contributed to the loss ratio. That is what I'm referring to. That is less elevated than what we've seen over the past couple of quarters but more elevated than what we've seen historically. And the actions that we are taking, we believe, are taking hold but it takes a little bit of time for that to work through the book in its entirety.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Good. And so that makes sense. And just curious, lots of your competitors call out and helps us -- tell us non-cat property was 2 points higher or 2 points less than expected. But Berkley has a smaller property book than some of those competitors. So just curious, are non-cat property losses, is that many -- is that 10 points of your loss ratio? Or are we talking kind of normal, it would be a low active number of points from the loss ratio?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo. Property is not a huge part of our book and no, it would not be anything approaching what you -- the number that you were referring to.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. And a follow-up on -- you made some interesting comments on some growing evidence that the tail is elongating on occurrence but maybe also at claims made. Just curious if you can elaborate because when we look at -- I thought last time we looked at your -- the statutory pay to incurred loss ratios, we couldn't see that. And I also noticed you didn't give us an update, I don't know if you want to, on just how paid-to-incurred loss ratios are trending for you all.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo as far as what we're seeing coming through, it was really more of a comment as far as the tail elongating based on discussions that we're having with our colleagues on the claims front and what they are seeing. So are we going to start to see it in the data? Yes. But one of the things that we try and do is not just wait to see it in the traditional actuarial data but we're visiting with colleagues trying to understand what are they seeing very much on the front lines because that's the leading indicator as to what to expect. I think the plaintiffs' bar is as aggressive as ever. And oftentimes, what they are trying to do is wait till the eleventh hour and then put forth a demand and try and create a situation that is optimal for them. But when -- I think we understand what they're trying to do and we are managing through it. So do I think that this is going to be a radical sea change? No. But are we conscious of it? Yes, we are. And I do not have the loss ratio in front of me but we will follow up with that for you, Mike.\n\nMike Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. And I guess lastly, we've obviously -- we and others value your insights. So when you're -- you've been talking a lot about medical inflation is brewing. In the CPI data, at least, it looks like it's inching higher but still looks a bit tame versus historic levels. Is this thesis kind of based on -- similar to what you just said about just talking with your folks on the front lines and understanding the macro and kind of you feel that there's going to be more inflation coming? Or are you actually seeing it? For example and I'll be quiet, Travelers commented today that the workers' comp inflation is still negative overall for them.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think the frequency trend is very attractive. I would -- I think as far as the medical trend goes, I don't believe that it's a negative and I believe it's going to be ticking up and that's just based on industry data that is available. I think if people choose to dig in, they will find out."

Part of the analysis when we think about the returning of the capital is not just what do we think the value of the business is today and what is our view on what real book value is, we also think about what the earnings power of the business is for the foreseeable future. And then we make what I believe is a thoughtful decision, with all of that and a few other things taking into account the best way to return the value to the shareholders. So that's sort of a long story short. Do I believe that we are able to continue to grow the business at a pretty healthy pace? Yes, I do. Do I believe that we're going to be able to continue to generate very healthy returns? Yes, I do. Do I think we'll be able to do that with an eye towards risk-adjusted return and do it in a consistent way? That is certainly the expectation. So, if you want to get a bit more into the details, we can try and do that offline. But we are not going to just try and hold on to capital that we don't need. In addition to that, we're conscious of what the capital needs will be in the future and we're aware of the fact that certain rating agencies are reexamining potentially what their view is going to be and we have a view as to what that may mean for us."

And again, we also had a bit of positive development coming through there.\n\nMark Hughes - Equity Research Analyst (Truist):\nAnd then in the GL line, you had a nice acceleration sequentially back up into double-digit growth. You'd mentioned the challenges around the plaintiffs' bar and the inflation but you seem to be enthusiastic. Any additional commentary about what you're seeing in GL?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLook, we -- places that we're growing, it's because we like the opportunity. I would tell you, a meaningful amount of the growth in that product line is coming from our colleagues that are managing E&S businesses.\n\nMark Hughes - Equity Research Analyst (Truist):\nAnd then finally, the casualty re was down, presumably a judgment on your view on -- again, on the plaintiffs' bar. But is that something you'd probably likely to shy away from here in the foreseeable future?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNo. It's not so much the plaintiffs' bar, though. Obviously, that's a contributor to how we think about loss cost and trend and rate adequacy. But it would seem as though the reinsurance marketplace struggles to have discipline across the board. So just as they're getting more disciplined in the property space, would seem as the professional and liability space may not have the same discipline it had yesterday."

Maybe you could just talk a little bit about either the sustainability of that or the drivers this quarter?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. Look, we're pleased with how the business is performing, Ryan. We're not going to get into a whole lot of minutia around that. But we think that the various businesses that make up that segment have positioned themselves well and they're reaping the benefits from it. And we think that it's likely that for the foreseeable future, that we'll continue to see good performance. That having been said, as I mentioned a few moments ago, there was some positive development; and that came out of one of the operations in that segment which was helpful.\n\nRyan Tunis - Equity Research Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then I guess in the Insurance segment, just thinking about growth. Yes, it seems like some of the primary carriers are growing quite a bit more than what the level of rate increases are. And some, like you, your top line growth looks more similar to the type of rate that you're reporting. So I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about, I guess, why we're not seeing something a little bit from a growth standpoint on top of the rate. Is it -- is retention lower than it was a year ago? Are you writing less new business? Just, I guess, give us a look into that.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWhen you look at the group, we're a bit of a bouquet. And there are certain parts of this group that are growing very rapidly. So for example, many of our E&S businesses are growing at a very healthy pace, to say the least. And there are other parts of the organization that are growing as well. But we're believers in underwriting discipline. And as you can see in the release, there are parts of the business that are growing quite quickly, perhaps in keeping with your comment relative to some others. And there are parts where we're just going to be more disciplined. So you would have taken note that workers' compensation, we are concerned about how competitive that marketplace is. And even with the growth in payrolls that we've seen, we are -- I would suggest in somewhat of a defensive mode. A similar story when it comes to professional liability and we're kind of scratching our head around public D&O. If you want to talk about the reinsurance, obviously, the casualty reinsurance is down a little bit and the monoline excess is up incrementally. So I think that -- and I can appreciate why people might look for a broader brush but we're looking at our business and we're looking at each part of the market that we participate in with a very fine brush. And we are trying to make sure we make good decisions in every pocket. And when you add up all the pieces, this is where it came out. Do I think that there is opportunity for there to be pockets of further momentum? Yes, absolutely. But I think that when push comes to shove, that's just the reality of when you put all the pieces together, this is where it came out.\n\nRyan Tunis - Equity Research Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then just following up, we've heard I guess, partially in response to the softer professionalized pricing market, there's been a more diverse set of players that find the cyber line attractive. Would you count yourself among that? Or has cyber been a big growth area for Berkley?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt's not a big growth area for us these days. There were moments in time where we found it to be very attractive. And then to your point, we saw a lot of people coming into the space. And again, we have the underwriting discipline that we're not going to do foolish things. So have we ever been a giant player in the space? No, we're careful and selective and we're conscious of how to manage the systemic exposure that comes along with that product line. But clearly, cyber has become a more competitive market and we have a view as to what an accurate rate is and appropriate terms and conditions. And we will draw the line in the sand and stay on the right side of it."

Just had a question just in terms of how far along we are in fixing that and specifically how many more quarters would you expect this to really have an impact on results?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think you're going to see it having a diminishing impact on results between now and the end of the year and it will be diminishing gradually.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. And then I guess, I'm assuming that the shift in mix, just sort of excluding the fire losses, the shift in mix would mean that something in the neighborhood of the loss ratio ex cat, ex reserve development is somewhat of a sustainable level just given the mix shift is obviously enduring. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI apologize but I'm not sure I fully understand the question. Could we do that once more, please?\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYes. So looking at the 59.5% accident year loss ratio ex cat, you cited mix as a sign as to why one of the reasons why that was at that level and it deteriorated a bit year-over-year. Obviously, in addition to the fire losses. Is that something -- just given the mix is obviously a more sustainable change, is that something we should expect around that level for the remainder of the year?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI can't answer the question with certainty but we think that ultimately, the way the portfolio is running and our ability to deliver a 90 combined or better and then 18% or 21% return, depending on how you look at it, feels like we're in a pretty comfortable spot. Do I think that there's the opportunity for the 59 to potentially improve a little bit? Yes, I do but we're not going to push the envelope unnecessarily and set the stage for disappointment in the future, particularly in an environment that's as complicated and volatile as this. We just don't think that's in the best interest of anyone. So we're -- in our book, at least, achieving very healthy outcomes for stakeholders while still ensuring that we are not putting undue pressure on the situation. And that's a good place to be, in our opinion.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. And then maybe just a follow-up. Obviously, not a big impact on the entire book with the $3 million of favorable reserve development. But you guys have been on top of the 2019 and prior casualty lines. Can you just talk about any changes you may have made to those lines for those years in the second quarter and how you feel about your reserving position there going forward?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. I mean you'll see more detail when the Q comes out. And to the extent it leaves you scratching your head, we're happy to catch up offline. But I would tell you, we feel very good about where our reserves are and we think they're well positioned to endure some of the things that we think either are ahead of the industry. And again, I think there's been a lot of chatter amongst some observers as to given all the rate we've gotten, why haven't we dropped our loss ratios more and it's because of all the uncertainty. So when the day is all done, do I think that we're in a good place? Yes. When push comes to shove, if you look at the average duration of our loss reserves there, give or take, 3.5 years. So if you think about that and you think about what that probably means as far as how far along that '16 through '19 year is, those years are as far as development, I think that things are -- that would suggest things are quieting down. And of course, as far as the more recent years, we are feeling as though that they're an exceptional place.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in, just on that last point, the more recent years. I know you had mentioned on the last call that you guys have been measured in terms of how quickly you recognize the progress from 2020 onwards and that could have implications for how you think about loss picks as you make your way through 2023 and into next year. Have you updated this view at all? This most recent quarter, just thinking about some of the comments you made about lengthening tails on occurrence and claims-made form [ph].\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nObviously, the tail comment has applicability in different ways to different product lines. I think some of the comments, if I recall correctly and maybe I'm mistaken, that you may be referring to would stem from policies that are written on a claims-made form. And when you write on a claims-made form and there is no notice, then that chapter is closed. So putting that aside, to the extent that you do have a notice or you have an occurrence form, then you need to spend some time thinking about how do I think about that tail extending or not. So we, as you would expect, bifurcate the book as we examine it in a variety of different ways and look at it at a very granular level. But I think perhaps what I was just referring to may touch on what you had been raising."

And while it's not -- having an overwhelming impact on the group overall, it's certainly a window of opportunity that we're going from a toe in the water to maybe a foot plus in the water. So the short answer is yes.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nGood. That's helpful. Second question, I'm just curious, Rob, you talked a little bit about pricing. You talked about D&O being challenging and some pressures you're seeing in commercial auto. I wonder if you can kind of bifurcate a little bit in what you're seeing kind of large commercial and then as you work your way down middle and small. Is it more competitive kind of in the excess liability for larger companies? And as you get down less, any differentiation?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAs far as the liability lines, the larger the account, by and large, the more competitive it is at this stage and that -- and there's our benefit because by and large, we are a small and middle market player compared to many of our peers. But yes, clearly, there is growing competition -- or is more visible with larger accounts.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. And I'll just throw one more in here. I'm wondering if maybe you can characterize your primary commercial property book. When you write commercial properties, is that cat-exposed stuff? Is that regular homeowners? What exactly are we looking at when you're seeing that growth in your commercial property book?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo in the commercial property book, it's a combination of a variety of different things. Certainly, there's a piece of that in there that's associated with Berkley One because probably we'll be splitting that out as that grows. In addition to that, we certainly write a bit of property that is cat exposed on the commercial line side. And -- but much of it is not a Tier 1, if you will, cat-exposed property."

R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo it is -- as far as medical malpractice, I would separate that as to -- that's a different issue. But as far as the medical costs go, as far as what is the Band-Aid cost today versus what does it cost yesterday for an injured worker, our expectation is that, that is clearly on the rise. Are you going to see it in other product lines? Yes but to a much lesser extent because when you think about a claims dollar, medical plays a far more significant role with workers' comp than any other product line that we're in.\n\nMeyer Shields - Equity Research Analyst (KBW (Keefe, Bruyette & Woods)):\nOkay, perfect. That's helpful. And then early on, I guess, in Richard's comments, you talked about -- well, I guess, I don't know if it's his or your commentary, actually but the expense ratio sit comfortably below 30.

Basically, the premise of the question is that comfortably below 30 doesn't even seem to be that high of a hurdle to achieve.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

And then one final question, if I can. I know it's really early in the third quarter but there's been a school of thought out there that maybe once we went through a full year of professional liability rate decreases that they would calm down.

And I'm just curious if you have changed any allocations there? Or just any kind of update on what's going on there in the strategy for that -- for the second half of the year and into 2024, if there's any change in that thinking.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. Look, the -- just to qualify that a little bit, certainly, we weren't happy with the performance but the loss was about $1 million or so. And what is driving that? It was primarily a participation in some alternative investments or private equity specifically, where there were some marks that they took down on some investments and then that trickled through to us. How do we see that unfolding from here? We'll let you know. But at this stage, I think that we're comfortable that people are taking the action that they need to take to make sure that those funds are appropriately marked but we're dependent on getting that information from the managers.\n\nScott Heleniak - Equity Research Analyst (RBC Capital Markets):\nOkay. Were those marks significant then for the quarter for the alts? Is there a number that you had on there?\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYou can follow up with Rich or Karen for the specifics but it was enough to take what's been a reasonably healthy run rate and bring it down to essentially zero.\n\nScott Heleniak - Equity Research Analyst (RBC Capital Markets):\nYes. Okay, got you. And then, just one more question. You mentioned there'll be a window of opportunity to deploy capital into higher-yielding securities in your durations at 2.3 years now and I'm just wondering if we might be getting close to that window of opportunity and how you see that playing out as well.\n\nRobert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt's certainly our hope and we're waiting for that to occur. And yes, we think it's coming but it may take some time. And ultimately, as in everything we do, we're focused not just on risk-adjusted return but we're not going to -- in an effort to -- we're not going to compromise, if you will, in a foolish way. And again, we are eagerly looking for the opportunity to allow us to extend that duration out a little bit. But right now, we are getting reasonably well rewarded for the position that we've taken."

But why don't I hand it over to our Chairman, who also moonlight as our Head of repurchase.\n\nWilliam Berkley - Executive Chairman (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, so I think that it's a constantly changing thing. It's based on the opportunity at any point in time. We will never do either if it precludes us from investing the money in the business opportunistically. So we will never do any of those things if they constrain our management of the business. At the moment in time where we think we're generating extra capital and we look ahead and see that we're going to have extra capital, we'll then make the judgment as to the share values, sort of looking out ahead versus the kinds of returns we think we should get to give our shareholders money. There's not an absolute rule, I think, that when the stock gets down to what we would say is an attractive price, we sort of -- we pay that and it just got, relatively speaking, more attractive price until you go back probably -- certainly more than 15 years. So, we were more inclined to do it. And it's a judgment we make each time we decide that we think we're going to have excess capital for a period of time as far ahead as we can see. And we try and make the judgment at that point in time, the stock price versus what we view as the intrinsic value of the enterprise. And we look ahead; so it's not that there's an absolute rule changes as we look at where we are, we're -- our leverage is a lot more stable now. We have the longer-term debt. We don't have any of those kinds of uncertainties that we had before. So there's not really a single rule that we go by. It's really looking ahead and saying, how do we think we'll best treat the shareholders by using the money effectively. And that obviously has to do with the price of the stock relative to the intrinsic value of the company."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLisa, thank you very much, and good afternoon all, and I guess a second welcome to our Q3 call. We appreciate you dialing-in and your time and your interest today. Joining me on the call, at least on this end, is Bill Berkeley, Executive Chair, as well as Rich Baio, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow on our typical agenda where momentarily I'll be handing it over to Rich. He\u2019s going to give us a bit of an overview and flag some highlights from the quarter. I will follow with a few comments of my own and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A. Before I do hand it to Rich, I just wanted to make a couple of quick observations and really one macro one in particular and that is on the results of the quarter. I think by any measure, I call it a 20% return is really an outstanding result. The fact is there were no one-time this or one-time that in there, that is truly when you strip it down to its fundamentals, that is how the business is performing. And these great results are really a reflection of a team. This is a team sport, not an individual sport. So my congratulations to all of our colleagues throughout the organization on a job very well done. I have the good fortune of being their mouthpiece in these types of settings. But again, this achievement was a team achievement. To that end, obviously it was a quarter where the organization was able to demonstrate our value proposition to capital. The idea of less risk for more return. We've talked to you all in the past about our, we are preoccupied with a concept that we refer to as risk-adjusted return. You can see it in moments like these that we just saw in Q3 very clearly. When as our Chairman says, the tide goes out, you get to see who's where and what. You could see it in both aspects of our business activities, one being underwriting, the other one being investing. Our underwriting results of a combined of a 90 during a period that had meaningful cat activity is really exceptional. Additionally, on the investing activity, clearly a book yield of 4.5%, while maintaining a quality of AA minus, and additionally, a new money rate of approximately 6%, that is no accident either. These results, these achievements are a result of our colleagues, their focus, their discipline, and their expertise. This call certainly is about reviewing what happened in the third quarter, but I would suggest even more than that, it is about how the table is set, not just for the coming quarters, but the next several years. So I think we are very well positioned. I think there is a fair amount of visibility. We will be getting into that in a bit more detail later in the call. But at this moment, let me hand it over to Rich and he's going to walk us through some numbers. Rich, if you would please?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOf course, thanks Rob, appreciate it. Net income increased 45.7% to $334 million or $1.23 per share with a return on equity of 19.8%. Operating income increased 30.1% to $367 million or $1.35 per share with an operating return on equity of 21.7%. The company's strong performance was driven by another quarter of significant underwriting profits, bringing the nine months year-to-date to a record, despite consecutive quarters of outsized industry-wide catastrophe losses. In addition, net investment income accelerated throughout the year to yet another quarterly record. Drilling further into the underwriting results, net premiums written grew 10.5% to a record of more than $2.8 billion. We significantly grew the insurance business by approximately 17.5% in other liability, short tail lines, and commercial automobile through rate and exposure. Decreases in workers' compensation and certain professional lines certainly tempered the growth in net premiums written bringing the overall insurance segment growth to 12.1%. The Reinsurance & Monoline access segment was flat quarter-over-quarter with continued growth in Monoline access and property reinsurance. Pre-tax underwriting income was $259 million with the calendar year combined ratio of a 90.2%. The current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 87.9%. Current accident year catastrophe losses in the quarter were $62 million or 2.3 loss ratio points, compared with $94 million in the prior year quarter or 3.9 loss ratio points. The prior year favorable development was approximately $1 million, and the current accident year loss ratio ex-CAT was 59.6%. The expense ratio increased 0.3 points to 28.3% from the prior year and remains in line with our nine months year-to-date. The small increase is attributable to the same items we've communicated during the past couple of quarters, that being the change in outward reinsurance structures impacting seating commissions and increased compensation costs along with startup operating unit expenses. We also continue to invest in technology and areas to drive operational efficiencies. Record quarterly net investment income of $271 million grew by 33.6% with the core investment portfolio increasing by 59.3%. There are two main drivers for the significant increase in the core portfolio, including the rising interest rate environment benefiting the reinvestment of fixed-maturity securities as they mature or are redeemed. And second, the increase in the size of the portfolio, due to continuous record levels of operating cash flows. In the third quarter, we reported another record level of operating cash flow of almost $1.1 billion. To put some context around this point, the book yield has grown from 3.8% in the first quarter of 2023 to 4.2% in the second quarter to 4.5% in the current quarter on fixed maturity securities. The current nine-month year-to-date book yield of 4.2%, compares to 2.6% for the prior year period. It's also worth noting that almost 81% of our net invested assets are in fixed maturity securities, cash, and cash equivalents. The credit quality of the fixed maturity securities remains strong at AA minus, and the duration is ticked up to 2.4 years from the consecutive quarter of 2.3 years. Partially offsetting the increase in the core portfolio is net investment income from investment funds. You may recall this asset class is generally reported on a one-quarter lag and will more closely correlate with the broader equity markets. Accordingly, reported net investment income from investment funds was approximately $4 million, representing a marginal improvement from the first-half of 2023. We continue to proactively manage our capital position as you saw our announcement of a $0.50 special dividend per share late in third quarter in addition to our regular quarterly dividend. This brings total capital return to investors "

And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thanks very much. That was great. So, I'm just going to offer a couple of other quick observations on the quarter and how we see things unfolding from here, and then again, we'll move on to the Q&A. Rich touched on the top line, obviously, building momentum again, as promised. This is a reminder to some number of quarters ago, we agreed to disagree with a couple of partners as to what we thought was an adequate rate. They did not think that we needed that much rate and again we decided to part ways that had a meaningful impact to the negative on our top line. That pig is making its way through the python to the extent that it's of interest, that was in the auto line. So we wish them well and we'll see how that unfolds. Speaking of different products, obviously the marketplace for the past 12, 18, 24 months or so has been very focused on property and with good reason. I would suggest to you, as we've commented in past quarters, auto liability is one that people need to continue to pay close attention to. I think as far as product lines, when it comes to social inflation, auto liability has the biggest bullseye on its chest. And by extension, that clearly spills over to excess and as well as umbrella. That having been said, just in general, social inflation continues to burn and we do not see that abating anytime soon. Quick comment on workers comp, I know we've touched on this in the past. We continue to be of the view that one needs to be very mindful of medical cost trend. We went through a period of time where it was pretty benign. We think that is shifting very quickly. We've touched on it in the past. We think it's going to become more and more into focus for a broader audience over the coming quarters. In addition to that, the benefit that comp was getting both as it relates to COVID and frequency and then on the heels of COVID a tight labor market and wage inflation, I think those benefits have run their course and clearly wage inflation is slowing. I mentioned a moment ago the topic of social inflation. We are very focused on it. You can see it in our rate increases. Ex-comp coming in at 8.5%. We have every intention of continuing to stay on top of it. We think the market is accepting our rate increases, and you can see that in part demonstrated by our renewal retention ratio continues to be at approximately a steady 80%. Another number that I find useful, perhaps others do as well, is the paid loss ratio. This is a number that we flagged for you all in the past, again coming in at a very healthy 47.9% for the quarter, which obviously, given where we are booking the business, would leave one to believe that the strength of our IBNR speaks for itself and would encourage people to look at our IBNR relative to case and IBNR relative to total reserves to the extent you're interested in the topic. As far as the investment portfolio goes, again, Rich went into some detail on this. I touched on it earlier. But without a doubt, it's not just about the 4.5% that we're getting on the book yield. I think the bigger story is the new money rate today of give or take 6%. You compound that with the strength of the cash flow that the business is experiencing. I think it's again setting a table for a very encouraging future. The duration we did bump out from Q3 to Q4, I think it's more likely than not over time you're going to continue to see that push out. But the fact is, having kept it short the way we have has given us greater flexibility to take advantage of the higher rates in a more immediate or over a shorter period of time. Finally, and perhaps a little bit on the forward-looking and picking up on the comments about the investment portfolio, nobody knows with certainty what tomorrow will bring, and there certainly is the potential for volatility to be around the corner. That having been said, you can see the business's ability to weather a choppy time as far as CAT activity. You can see the rate increases that we are getting, and you can see how, quite frankly, I should say, we can see where the book yield is going. So that all having been said, I think it's very clear where the -- how the business is positioned for the coming quarters and the coming years, and the earnings power of the business is likely to be accelerating from here. Lisa, I'm going pause there, and why don't we go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

Berkley Corporation):\nHi, Mike. Good afternoon.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nHey, good afternoon. Maybe to your comments about the table being set and kind of a bit more visibility, you know, is it -- I just want to just make sure that, you know, this visibility is increasing coming from the investment income, whereas, kind of, you do talk about there being still continued uncertainty on social inflation and medical cost trends, et cetera. Just curious to the latter comments. Has Berkley changed its, kind of, view at all materially over the last couple months or a few months on loss costs, trends?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think social inflation continues to be a challenge. But if you look at the rate increases that we're achieving ex-comp of 8.5%, I think that we're in a comfortable position to be able to more likely than not absorb whatever that inflation trend is sending our way. So do I think there's opportunity for the underwriting result to show improvement over time? Yes, I do. That having been said, when we're generating a 20% return, there is no need to push the envelope. I think if you look at the paid loss ratio and how it's been running for some number of quarters, that should be a pretty good leading indicator. As far as the investment portfolio goes to the point that you raised, Mike, I think it's pretty straightforward. You know, you can see what the new money rate is, you know what the duration is, and you can just -- it's not that hard to calculate the upside from here. And as, you know, time goes by, we're just locking in every day, higher and higher rates and pushing that to reach out. So, from my perspective, certainly there's a lot of upside on the investment portfolio, but I would encourage people not to discount the opportunity on the underwriting side either.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, understood and maybe as a follow-up on the top line growth and you mentioned there were some partners you know part away with that might have led to some of the diesel, I don't know if that was last year, but you know this year we're seeing some momentum in the top line and PW just like pricing let's say being flattish? Any story underlying that you'd like to share a trend line?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it's just at least what I was trying to articulate to make a long story short. The momentum is returning on the top line, because those relationships that we're in the process of parting ways with are getting towards the tail end. And the impact on the top line is diminishing with every passing quarter. As a result of that, it's impacting the overall less and less. In addition to that, the other piece that I should mention is there are parts of the professional liability market that are really, really competitive and we're just not going to follow things down the drain. If it doesn't make sense, we're not going to do it. And it's a similar story with workers comp. Fortunately, there's lots of opportunities in other parts of the marketplace and you know we are going after those and that's what's driving the growth that you see and I think you're like -- more likely than not to see more of that. Sure is the rate increase a component of it? Yes, but it's certainly not the whole story.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

My first question is I guess, you know, building upon the growth conversation, you know, as you guys had alluded to rate growth within the insurance book did pick up in the quarter, obviously, pushes and pulls across the different business lines. Rob, just based off of your overall outlook, you know, how would you expect, I guess, premium growth within that book to trend not only in the fourth quarter but also in 2024 as well?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nObviously, at least nobody knows exactly what tomorrow will bring, but as you would see over the past several quarters there has been the momentum that's building and there's nothing that I see today that's going to take the wind out of that sale.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then in terms of the prior year development, so $1 million overall favorable, was there any noise in either insurance or reinsurance within that $1 million or any noise within different accident years that you want to call out? I know you typically wait for the 10-Q, but anything worth flagging tonight?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes, I don't think there was anything particularly noteworthy. Rich, did you have anything that he wanted to flag on the call?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI would agree with your comment, Rob, I don't think there's much, you know, in terms of from a segment perspective, pretty benign, you know, in each of the segments, so I think that's all I would comment before the queue.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

General liability, you had another acceleration this quarter, anything going on there are you seeing some sort of rehardening perhaps in GL?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that it's a combination of things, one is rate, and two, certainly our E&S businesses in particular are benefiting from that as well, and our Specialty businesses overall. I think there's a recognition, two things; one, there's discipline, people are taking the rate, and two, I think that there is a growing percentage of the audience that is looking to do business with carriers that they can have confidence in and that's not just about ratings and in the eyes of the insured, I think it's also distribution partners, where they are trying to narrow the number of relationships they have and have those relationships the more important and really focusing on partners that they know will be there tomorrow in a predictable and consistent manner.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist):\nUnderstood. How about the property reinsurance market, had a little slower growth this quarter compared to the last couple of quarters, what do you see happening there?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

Berkley Corporation):\nHi, Alex.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nHi, Good afternoon. So I wanted to ask you about the paid loss ratios. I mean, you know, I think in 1Q is 48%, it sounds like it's around that level now still. Can you help us think through like how much is that benefiting from the growth in the business, just with insured values and so forth going up, you know, how does that compare over like a longer period of time ex, you know, sort of those items? I'm just trying to think through, I mean it seems like that's an important part of why you're so optimistic on the future. And as you all know, there is a fair amount of criticism of some of the older accident years. I'm just trying to think through order of magnitude, that dynamic, and sort of how seasoned the older stuff is. I mean, anyway you can help me think through all that.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure, so maybe a couple of comments. First off, as far as the growth and the benefit of the growth, I would encourage you to go back and look at how much growth has occurred because of exposure, if you will, versus how much is the growth has come because we are just charging more for each unit of exposure and I would tell you a lot of it is driven by that. In addition to that, as far as reserves and how they develop out, the average duration of our loss reserves is give or take 3.5 years and that's paid. So what my point is, is that the years that perhaps are viewed as more challenging. I think you should have some level of comfort and sense of where those are coming out at this stage.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nGot it. That's helpful. Second question I had for you is, I guess on general liability, other liability, and maybe the preference between primary versus reinsurance, you know, I'm just noticing the casualty reinsurance has been declining a bit and we've heard some more cautious commentary from some of the global reinsurers. I just want to understand what you're seeing there that's causing you to favor the primary versus reinsurance exposure?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I think there are a couple of things, first off, a lot of it is not necessarily that the underlying business is less attractive and maybe about the ceding commissions that they are able to command, and at some point, maybe we think the underlying business is okay, but the ceding commissions that our competitors are willing to play on the reinsurance side, that they don't make sense to us. In particular, I would call out some of the professional liability space, but I'm not going to get into more detail on that. As far as on the liability side on the direct or insurance front, you know, it's just where we see opportunities and we like what we see in much of the marketplace, particularly Specialty, and if you want to get even more granular much of the E&S market. And as you and others are aware, we're one of the largest players in the E&S space and in particular in the liability lines. So this is just a good moment, and again, what's going on with the reinsurance isn't necessarily that we just think the market has gone to hell as far as the primary, we just may not agree with what some others are viewing as an appropriate feed. You know, I have heard as of late from some reinsurers commenting on social inflation, and all of a sudden they discovered this thing called litigation funding and, you know, kind of, makes you scratch your head and wonder where they've been for the past decade, because these are not new phenomenon, these are things that those of us that are in the marketplace, at least in the weeds, we've been not just talking about the dealing with for an extended period of time. So there's nothing new there. I think it's great that they're focused on it, maybe they'll bring more discipline to the marketplace.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

Can we talk a little bit short-tailed lines, lot of growth there, you know, I mean, that, you know, that says to me there's property in there, but short-tail is a pretty big catch up for a lot of things, a lot of growth instead what you're finding there and what the opportunities are?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLion's share of its property. There is a little bit of auto physical damage in there and, you know, on both fronts, particularly in the property, I think you know the story as well as we do. There is a need for rate, there is an opportunity for rate, and we are trying to make the most of it.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd do you have -- obviously, your reinsurance costs are up a little bit, you're not a huge buyer of reinsurance, are you able to take on some of that increased price to the benefit of the shareholders or some of that getting passed off the reinsurance market.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe short answer is, Josh, that we are trying to ensure that the additional cost of that capacity that we rent is being passed on to the client and I think we're doing that reasonably well. Not a perfect indicator, but you can see that in the difference between the gross and the net and part.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd then, look, it's down a lot from where it was in 3Q '22 but the cat loss in the reinsurance segment was somewhat high. I don't think your big Hawaiian right, but maybe there's some homes in Hawaii you write the Albo in the Panhandle in Florida, just doesn't seem like that would have been a big area for you. Can you talk about the cat loss a little bit in the reinsurance segment?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. The long story short, did we have modest exposure to the things that you're talking about or that you flagged, yes. And then there was also some SCS exposure in there, too.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay. And if I can get one more in. In terms of -- I know you guys gave the rate -- not really loss trend. You talked a lot about commercial and where it can be. What is the loss trend in commercial auto? And what are you reserving to given your concerns about social inflation? Is there a variance between where you think the loss trends currently and where you're booking it? I know you're trying to be conservative but is this something that's been prepared for in how you're pricing and whatnot?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe short answer is on the part of the portfolio. But generally speaking, we are looking to build in a risk margin beyond what the actuarial answer would be.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay, well, thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

Good afternoon. Just had a question on the commercial auto premium growth and I guess I hear your commentary loud and clear on social inflation impacting that line, so I was a little surprised that the growth accelerated there, was that more a function of this partner that you parted ways with, resulting in I guess an easier comp or have you seen something change there on the pricing side this quarter that makes you want to lean into the commercial auto market a little bit more?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo a couple of things that's worth noting. Yeah, part of it has to do with the a bit of run-off as you alluded to, but the bigger story from my perspective is, the rate that we are achieving. And we are pushing very hard on the rate and we're getting it. And ultimately, we have a view as to how much we need for rate and to the extent that we're getting it, then we don't have a problem writing the business. But we are not going to write it if we don't think we can get the rate that is required plus to achieve our targeted return.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it, thanks. That's encouraging. And then maybe, you know, I know you guys have been vocal on just workers' comp, medical cost inflation, and staying on top of those trends. I'm wondering if you're actually starting to see that come through, then manifest in your claims data, just in terms of the medical cost inflation starting to impact your payments.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWe certainly are seeing early signs of it, and we've been seeing it for a little while, which has really been one of the catalysts for the caution. I think we've been talking about for some time, how the providers, if you will, their economic model is not sustainable. They -- many of them, particularly the large health systems are destroying huge amounts of capital and something is going to have to give. And ultimately, part of how that riddle is going to get solved is through the payers. Workers' compensation is not going to be insulated from that. The story is not just about pharma. It's about other components of medical costs. And I think you're putting the comp component aside for a moment. If you talk to large payers, the United, the Cigna, et cetera, and you talk about the type of trend that they are seeing and then you extrapolate from that, what does it mean for workers' comp, who, by the way, we probably don't actually, we definitely don't have the same negotiating leverage that someone like a United would have, I think that's pretty instructive.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Understood. And then maybe if I can sneak one more in, just a quick one. I didn't hear you talk at all about the fire losses. And I think is that fair to assume that that's pretty much one you guys have re-underwritten that book, and that's no longer impacting results? Or did that have some smallish impact this quarter as well?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe answer is that it wasn't overly noteworthy in the quarter. I'm not inclined to declare victory because then it always comes back to bite us. But I think we're making progress on that front. That having been said, as far as the loss picks go, for our conversation around the environment, we're just not in a rush to do anything but be thoughtful and measured. The fact is the business is generating by any measure, great returns and we don't see that changing. So there's no reason to push better for us just to make sure that it is thoughtful and well controlled. And if we're going to err, we're comfortable erring on the side of caution.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

How is it going?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nEs. I\u2019m doing well.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nFirst question just on short tail lines. Obviously, there's been some mix shift in that direction. I think that, that would have somewhat of a lower underlying loss ratio. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it potentially does. But with a lot of those lines, you got to remember, we carry a cat load. So we are not going to release the cat load prematurely. So that could spill over that benefit may not be realized, if you will, we may carry that through into a future period. But yes, to your point, would it have a lower loss ratio oftentimes, yes.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nAnd then, I guess, just bigger picture with commercial auto. It seems like it's been like almost an impossible line to underwrite over the past decade. Just curious like for a business like Berkley. Why does that line need to be such a large component of what you underwrite? Is it that it's bundled with other stuff? Or you think you can ultimately get it right? I'm just curious why structurally that has to be such a large part of your mix?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. So I think we need to dissect that a little bit. And apologies in advance if this proves to be more of an answer than you're looking for. But as far as commercial auto goes, I would draw the analogy perhaps to your point that it's sort of the industry's version of whack-a-mole. As far as our book goes, we write it both stand-alone and we also write it as part of a package. Is it relevant to how you write a package? Yes, it is. But that doesn't mean you should write it in an undisciplined manner. I think as far as the Monoline goes, we play when we think we're making a buck and quite frankly, a lot of our Monoline guys, we think, over the past few years have done very well. So we'll see over time, but I think we just have some reservation and concerns about where the marketplace is going. That having been said, it has caused us indigestion from time-to-time. I think we've as of late, have more consistently done better where we're running at Monoline because we are very focused on it. I think there are some examples where we've written as part of a package where we probably haven't been as focused and didn't have is strong and expertise being brought to bear, and that is something that we are working at changing. But yes, are there moments in time where I look at it and I say, how does this make sense? That having been said, there are many parts of this organization where they are doing it consistently well.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nThanks, Rob.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

Particularly as far as cyber goes, it's going to be interesting to see what type of pressure the reinsurance marketplace brings to bear on the underlying or the insurance marketplace. As far as D&O goes, it continues to be very, very competitive. Other parts of professional liability, I would tell you that to a varying degree, it's pretty challenging out here. So again, I think that you can still make a buck in a bunch of pockets, but you need to be careful.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. Makes sense. And then, Rob, just remind me that, that business going through the python. Is it anything impact on your underlying or your loss picks? So you just having to set a little more conservative? Is that book earn kind of runs off here?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe answer is as we saw what was going on with it. We pushed the picks up. We think what we're carrying makes sense and it won't be an issue but quite honestly, we wish them well, but we're not going to miss them.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

And I'm wondering about now that we're nine months through the year, how the growth that you've seen compares with the expectations you had and the opportunity you saw as you go back to December of last year?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that we feel quite good about what has been accomplished by our colleagues and I understand that many of you, the only barometer you have is how much premium that we are writing. But what may not always come through as clearly is maybe we're collecting the same amount of premium but we've reduced the exposure by one-third or maybe we're collecting 30% more premium, but we've reduced the exposure considerably. So it's not just a matter of how much you write. It's a matter of how much you're going to make, obviously. And I think our colleagues both domestically as well as outside of the U.S. have done a nice job navigating the channel and continue to.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, fantastic.

That can obviously be impacted as you're familiar, Mark and others are as well. Our oftentimes prefer an approach for growth is through de novo or starting new businesses. When you start a new business and it's in its infancy and doesn't have scale, not a lot of earned premium that has a negative impact on your expense ratio. That having been said, we think it's a much more controlled model to growing the business. So again, does it pick up a little bit, it can go up, it can go down. But probably the biggest driver around that is businesses that we start and the timing for them to get to scale.

My first question, and I may be paraphrasing what I think I heard from you, but I think you're not taking the foot off the pedal in terms of rate. At the same time, you are achieving a ROE of about 20% new money rates would suggest upside there. So why is there a need to continue to aggressively push rate here? Is it that you worry about medical inflation, social inflation and once they rear there had they quickly impact margins?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I don't think it's once they rear their heads. I think their head is fully reared at this stage, and the neck just keeps growing. So from my perspective, it is exactly what you suggested, it is loss cost trend. And while perhaps there's some evidence that financial or economic inflation is slowing, though still elevated relative to what it's been in the recent past. There is no evidence that social inflation is abating at all. And as a result of that, we're just going to keep pushing. And at a minimum, we need to keep up with that.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. And then we haven't heard in a while about the international book. Can you maybe give us a quick update there. Is it margin accretive, dilutive for the quarter for year-to-date? How growth patterns developing there?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt's accretive. We have some terrific businesses outside of the United States. Run by some outstanding people with a shared set of values that we have in other parts of the business, very focused on a lot of the things that we talked about, particularly risk-adjusted return. And it is certainly not dilutive to the franchise overall.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nGot it. If I could sneak one last one, if I may. On the property book in the loss picks there. assume those develop a bit faster than you see in the casualty line. So how long before you start updating those? Is it mostly frequency driven and we could see those start to move according to the actual frequency within a couple of quarters? Or does it take longer?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt takes a little bit of time. We look at it every 90-days or so and don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think there's two pieces to it. One is how do we think about attritional or, if you will, the risk book versus how do we think about the cat exposure. The cat piece is a little bit of a different story, as I was at least trying to suggest earlier, we have a cat load that we build in, and we're not going to release that prematurely. We'll have that roll over from quarter-to-quarter. As far as the attritional goes, we just want to give it a little bit of time to see how it plays out. But yes, it's not -- it shouldn't be measured in years and years.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSarah, thank you very much, and good afternoon all and welcome to our fourth quarter call, and for that matter full year '23 call. In addition to me, you also have Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman, on the call as well as Rich Baio, Chief Financial Officer of the Company. We're going to follow our usual agenda where very shortly I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk us through some highlights from the quarter. Once he's completed his comments, I'll offer a couple of thoughts at my own and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A. Before I hand it over to Rich, I did just want to offer a thought or two and for some participants who is probably won't be new to, I guess, a discussion that we've had in the past. For our organization, there is without a doubt amongst all of our colleagues, a shared recognition that the goal of the exercise is value-creation. We approach this through a lens that we've again touched on in the past, but I'll flag it again. A lens that we referred to is risk-adjusted return. All returns are not created equal. One needs to consider the type of risk that you're taking on in order to achieve that return. And in contemplating that risk, one needs to consider volatility as a component of that. One is to ask themselves the question? Am I getting paid enough for that risk? And of course in considering that, what role volatility plays. In the fourth quarter of '23, there should be many market participants that report good numbers. But I think that one needs to look beyond just a quarter. One needs to look at the year. One needs to look at the past several years. When it comes to value creation, it's not just about a step forward. It's about consistently taking steps forward, and it's about avoiding taking steps backwards. When you look at the results of our quarter, without a doubt, they are very strong, very robust by any measure. But I would encourage people to look at the full year and look at the past many years and our ability to create value, taking into account the risk that we are accepting in order to achieve those returns, is really the cornerstone why we've been able to build value for shareholders so successfully over many years. This quarter and this year, no exception. So to that end, before I hand it over to Rich, I would like to thank and congratulate my colleagues throughout the organization on a really outstanding quarter, outstanding year, and yet another year of a job very well done. Also, on behalf of my colleagues. I would like to thank our shareholders for allowing us the opportunity and the privilege for managing capital on their behalf. I will pause there and Rich, over to you. What do you have for us?\n\nRich Baio - Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it, and, good afternoon, everyone. The Company continued to report record-setting financial results in the quarter, leading to an outstanding full year. Net income increased to $397 million or $1.47 per share compared with $382 million or $1.37 per share in the prior year quarter. Annualized return on beginning-of-year equity was 23.6%. Record operating income increased more than 21% to $392 million or $1.45 per share with an annualized return on beginning-of-year equity of 23.2%. Our extreme ownership in maximizing risk-adjusted return and everything we do contributed to our record full year underwriting income, net investment income, operating income, and net income. Our top-line growth accelerated throughout the year with the fourth quarter reflecting a 12% increase in net premiums written to more than $2.7 billion, bringing the full year to a record of almost $11 billion. On a constant foreign currency exchange rate basis, the quarterly and full year growth was adversely impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to the weakening U.S. dollar. On a segment basis, insurance grew 12.3% to more than $2.4 billion in the quarter from rate improvement and exposure growth. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 10.2% to more than $300 million. This marks a record level for full year gross and net premiums written for each segment. Turning to underwriting performance. Record quarterly pre-tax underwriting income increased 8.2% to $316 million, representing a calendar year combined ratio of 88.4%. Current accident year catastrophe losses were flat at 1.2 loss ratio points for the comparable quarters with $32 million and $30 million reported in fourth quarter 2023 and 2022 respectively. Prior year development was favorable by $1 million, bringing our current accident year loss ratio ex-cats to 58.8%. The improvement over the prior year's quarter of 50 basis points was primarily due to business mix and lower attritional property losses. The expense ratio increased 60 basis points to 28.4% in the current quarter, flat to the 2023 full year. The increase from the prior year's quarter is consistent with our prior communication that being lower ceding commissions resulting from business mix and reinsurance structure changes over the past year. In addition, increased compensation costs and startup operating unit expenses have also contributed to the small increase. We expect that our 2024 full year expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%, taking into consideration, investments in such things like technology and data and analytics as well as new startup operating unit expenses. So in summary, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of the quarter was 87.2%. Record quarterly pre-tax net investment income increased more than 35% to $313 million, bringing the full year to more than $1 billion for the first time in the Company's history. The combination of our short-duration and record level operating cash flow of more than $2.9 billion in the full year has positioned us well to invest in securities with higher interest rates. The book yield on the fixed maturity portfolio continued to advance throughout the year to 4.4% on a 12-month basis. Our net invested assets increased approximately 10% in the past year to almost $27 billion. The credit quality of the portfolio remains very strong at AA minus with a duration on our fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents of 2.4 years. The investment funds improved from the consecutive quarter to $11 million although declined from the prior year in large part due to market value adjustments in the real estate fund area. As a reminder, the investment funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. Foreign currency losses in the quarter related to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to most other currencies. It's worth noting, however, that the net effect to stockholders' equity is negligible since the improvement in our currency trans"

It's worth noting, however, that the net effect to stockholders' equity is negligible since the improvement in our currency translation adjustment more than offset the amount reflected in the income statement. Stockholders' equity increased to a record of almost $7.5 billion. Careful capital management throughout the year resulted in three special dividends of $0.50 each per share plus regular quarterly dividends totaling $501 million. In addition, share repurchases in the quarter of almost 1.6 million shares contributed to a total of more than 8.7 million shares repurchased during the year, amounting to $537 million or $61.69 per share. So our capital management during 2023 aggregated to more than $1 billion, the most we've returned to shareholders in one year while growing shareholders' equity more than 10% and maintaining more than adequate capital to support ongoing growth in the business. Book value per share increased to 11.6% and 25.5% in the quarter and full year before dividends and share repurchases. And Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thank you very much. Pretty attractive picture and even a conservative CPA couldn't make it sound anything other than encouraging. So a couple of observations on my end. Obviously, the top-line growth, we're pleased with the progress that we're making relative to the past few quarters. I think this is unfolding exactly as we suggested. Just calling out a few pieces of that puzzle, clearly some of the things that we had talked about as far as portfolios that we were separating from, much of that pig is through the Python. The specialty market in general continues to be particularly attractive. I would highlight E&S especially, furthermore, I don't think that party is over. When we're looking at the submission flow, we continue to be quite encouraged. On the other hand, certainly, within the professional liability space and I'll call out public D&O as perhaps one of this extreme examples, I think it is delicate and treacherous and as you can see in the numbers in our release, we are treading thoughtfully as you'd expect. Rich touched on the rate coming in at 8%, which based on our assessment is pretty clear that we are comfortably exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss cost trend. And we are encouraged by that. I know that there are couple of chicken littles out there that are sort of hanging on the rate number that we share on a quarterly basis and some might say, well, geez, this is down below where it was in the third quarter and that is a factually correct statement. That having been said, I would caution people to please understand that is really driven by mix of business and not just product line, but we have more than 60 different businesses under the Group umbrella and at any moment in time, some are growing more than others and rate opportunity is not equal amongst all the businesses in the Group, and obviously our product lines as well. And just as a point of reference, you'll recall this time or fourth quarter '22, we got 6.9 points of rate ex-comp. So again, we are comfortably above where we were a year ago and we are confident again that we are exceeding trend by a meaningful margin. Again, Richie talked about the losses. I'm not going to get into that. The only thing that I will flag is that the paid loss ratio for the quarter came in at 48 and change, and for - I don't know how many quarters it is at this at this stage, it's just sort of floating between 46 and 49, which I think is really just a reflection of the rate action along with the underwriting discipline and focus of our colleagues that are allowing us to be arguably writing business at a pretty healthy margin, to say the least. Again, Rich touched on the expense piece. So I'm not going to rehash that other than I will make the one comment that for purposes of '24, we have some businesses that we started prior. And those are going to be impacting our expense ratio, though, even with those coming into the expense ratio, as they are in business for a full year, the fact of the matter is, that's going to be a relatively modest drag. Going the other way as far as benefit goes, you'll see what happen with our written premium in Q3 and certainly in Q4 and we all know how that's going to travel through and impact the earned in '24, which will clearly be a positive. Last comment on the investment portfolio. Rich touched on that. As far as the book yield, as far as we're concerned, the new money rate for us still today, even with all the humming and honking about where interest rates are going, we still can put money to work at 5%-plus. So we think there's opportunity there. As Rich mentioned, the duration, 2.4 years. We are looking for the window of opportunity to nudge that out. We are not in a rush. We have a slightly different view than much of the world as to where interest rates are going. And when the window of opportunity presents itself, you will likely see that 2.4 moving out from here. So again, I think it's exciting that we had a good quarter. It's rewarding and encouraging that we had a good year and top of - a good year in '22 and so on, but I think the most encouraging thing is when you look at where, I should say, how the table is set for '24 and beyond, we are in a very good place and not only on the underwriting side but on the investment side. So I believe in '24 and likely beyond, you are going to continue to see this economic model firing on all cylinders. So that probably wasn't as brief as I promised, but it was relatively brief for me, and I'm going to pause there and Sarah, we would be very pleased to open it up for questions. Thank you."

Premium growth picked up right in the third and the fourth quarter ending at 12% in the fourth quarter. So as you think out to '24. Is that kind of the baseline would you expect the quarters of '24 to all be 12% or greater, just given the momentum that you've been highlighting on the call?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes, no, Elyse, I appreciate that you and other colleagues are trying to build models and making certain assumptions. But the truth of the matter is that, tell me what market conditions are going to be. And I can give you a thoughtful answer to your question. There is nothing that I see today that leads me to believe that there isn't meaningful opportunity before us. And again, do I think the 12% number is a reasonable number to use? Yes. Do I think it's possible to be better than that? It certainly is possible. But again tell me what the market conditions will be and then I can give you a more thoughtful answer as opposed to fumbling around on this end.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nMaybe sticking with that market thought, right? We've heard a lot of conjecture about whether we start to see a broader strengthening of the casualty market. And so where are you on that? Do you think we'll start to see more broad-based pricing momentum within casualty lines as we go through 2024?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think you should. From our perspective, obviously, one of the big drivers there is social inflation and as far as we're concerned, it's alive and well. In addition to that, as far as another pressure point, I think you're starting to see the reinsurance marketplace, particularly on the treaty side, but across-the-board starting to wake up and really recognize some of the challenges that the liability market faces. And the kind of pressure that you saw, the reinsurance marketplace, but on the property line, I think, while it may not be to the same extent, I think you're going to see them start to really focus on the - some of the liability lines and I think that will perhaps introduce further discipline into the casualty market. Quite frankly, if you go back in time, we've sort of been standing on our head and jumping up and down, talking about social inflation for many years. And we started pushing on rate pretty early and it's been good to see more recently people showing up to the party and recognizing what that loss trend is, recognizing what that means for this loss cost and taking action. So long story short, I think that there is some more legs to the liability market, particularly umbrella, auto liability, GL, and there's a lot of the excess market overall.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then one more. You guys said $1 million. I think a favorable development in the quarter. I know, we typically get more color when the K is filed. But any movements within lines or accident years that were more significant - the more significant nature in the fourth quarter.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNothing that's particularly earth-shattering. I would say it's kind of more of the same. But if you're looking for more detail, I'd encourage you just give Karen or Rich a call and if you can't get one of them, just give me a buzz.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay, thank you.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

How - what are you seeing in terms of loss development on some of those older accident years, particularly in the casualty lines, any change in trajectory this year compared to prior years?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI would suggest that some of the older years are beginning to show signs of petering out and I think some of the more recent years that look particularly encouraging. As they season out more, we will be more inclined to recognize the good news. But I think at this stage, if you look at the average duration of our loss reserves or an average life of our loss reserve, which is 3.5 plus years, just shy of four years at this stage, we have our arms around, I think a lot of the years that we're particularly frustrating where I think the industry may have gotten caught a little flat-footed, and ourselves are not completely insulated from that with social inflation. I think we may have gotten on top of it a little quicker than some. But nevertheless, '16 through '19 is not without its challenges. That having been said, I think some of the more recent years are encouraging, but I think '16 through '19 are slowing considerably and certainly the earlier of that Group, I think have - maybe not fully played out but are pretty darn close.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist):\nYes, very good. How about on workers comp, you had some growth in premiums written this quarter. How are you thinking about that?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

Anything, any update on....\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWe still have reservations about the product line. We're pleased that we participate in the market. We think our colleagues that are in this space have exceptional expertise and are managing the capital well. But by and large if there is a little bit more of a certainly neutral to defensive posture at this stage, I think as we've talked about in the past, we think that the medical trend is going to prove to be challenging. As far as obviously the U.S. comp market is both broad and deep. And from what I hear from my colleagues that are far more knowledgeable than I, I would keep an eye on California for leading the charge as far as market bottoming out.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist):"

I guess just if we wanted to reflect on the past 12 to 18 months, you've discussed it a bit, but there was kind of a pivot downwards in growth for a bit. Did the - was the pivot more the marketplace changed in terms of competition, or was it more so reflection of what you've been talking about? Hi, loss costs are - we need to do a bit of a true-up and - you've gotten that picture of the Python and kind of now the - it's kind of a smoother sailing from here. Just kind of curious how much was kind of more, you think, Berkeley-specific versus just market forces and the competitors doing their thing.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo the way I characterize it, Mike, is I think that the market is changing every day. And if you go back, call it two years ago, professional liability, D&O, as an example, was in a different place than it is today. So you have that force. On the other hand, clearly, two years ago property was in a different place than it is today. So you have all these pieces that at any moment in time some things are firming, some things are softening, and obviously, that instructs how we feel and how strong or not our appetite is. In addition to that, I think, as we may have flagged in some earlier calls, there were a couple of what I would describe as meaty relationships scale-wise, that we came to a shared understanding that we agreed to disagree as to what an appropriate rate need is and what action was required. And as a result of that, we wished each other well, or at least we wished them well, and that played a role in it as - in addition to the earlier comments. So do I think that the 12% is this like phenomenal number? That's one-off. The answer is no. I think that there were some things in the first half of the year that served as somewhat of an extreme drag, and what you're seeing now is a lot of that shift away has been processed.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, that's helpful context. Clearly, the ROE for the year ended up being excellent. So I guess just switching gears a little bit, I think you mentioned the reinsurers. Anything we should be thinking about maybe within your expense ratio guidance or just as the year progresses, in terms of if the reinsurers are able to successfully garner higher pricing, seating commissions or whatnot, on what - they charge their counterparties, such as Berkeley for casualty reinsurance. I know you guys have a reinsurance arm, obviously too, so there's an offset. But just curious if there's something -\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes, obviously, we take it from one pocket and hopefully, we're getting it back and then some in the other pocket. I think one of the things that - so do I think it's possible that you're going to see some of the reinsurance marketplace trying to take action, for example, with seeding commissions? Yes, I do. The good news for our organization, as we've discussed, because of our limits profile and how the business is operated with approximately 90% of our policies that are legally allowed to have limits, having a limit of $2 million or less, that makes us less reinsurance dependent. So consequently, we have the ability to pivot and think about what we buy, perhaps differently than some of our peers, and we also can shift structurally. So as Rich mentioned earlier, around the seed, part of the reason why the - excuse me, around the expense ratio partly has to do with seed, where people wanted to cut seeding commissions. So maybe we switched to an XoL structure that made sense to us, given the rate environment, and that worked out. So the punchline is this, Mike, a hardening reinsurance market when it comes to the casualty lines, net net will be very good for us as an organization because it will force further discipline and consequently pricing power for the primary market. And in addition to that, my colleagues on the reinsurance side, I'm sure will be right in there seizing the opportunity.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, that's helpful. And maybe if I can sneak one last one in, if Bill thinks it's a question worthy of his wisdom. Presidential election year, to the extent the outcome is for a change of the guard, is there anything market-wise, investment portfolio-wise, or just interest rate-wise you guys are thinking of in terms of hard or dry or pivot? If that is an outcome late this year.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nBefore he answers that, I think we may need to read the Safe Harbor again.\n\nBillBerkley - Executive Chairman (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, I think the bottom line is, we've got a $2 trillion deficit. 92% of the world's countries have deficits. There is going to be an enormous demand for money. Number two, we are the only significant democratic country that doesn't have any kind of national sales tax. We have some flexibility. However, you have to look at every time there's been a need to come to a conclusion, Democrat or Republican, the conclusion has been both parties spend more money. So what that tells you is spending money and not having taxes go up are a cornerstone of the policies both parties have chosen to follow. At some point, we're going to have to decide someone is going to have to pay for all we're doing. And whether that's a value-added tax or increasing income taxes or whatever, we are going to have to do something, and it's going to happen during the next presidential period, or Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid are going to be in jeopardy. So I don't think it matters who's elected. That's a problem that we're going to face. It won't happen till after the election. Whomever is elected won't matter. And I think that's going to mean is we're going to have some pressure on inflation, pressure on government spending, and I don't think that means good things for interest rates coming down. I would expect interest rates at best will be flat. I think people are biased by the fact that we had an extended period with extraordinarily low interest rates. I don't think interest rates are going to go crazy, but I don't think we're going to see them consequentially lower than they are now and probably a little higher.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

So I just had a question on the rates that you guys are seeing now in liability lines. If we exclude comp and exclude financial lines, I'm wondering if you started to see evidence of those rates accelerate in the quarter - in the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense for if we were to adjust for the mixed dynamics that you had just mentioned in your opening remarks if we are actually starting to see those rates move higher in response to the environment.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo generally speaking, we don't break the rate data out by product line, but I guess to give you a little bit of color, I would tell you that we are very happy with the rate increases that we are achieving in much of the liability market, to say the least. We are comfortable that, putting aside some challenges within the professional liability space, the rest of it, we think that we are keeping up with trend and then some, or clearing trend by a meaningful margin. So, are things better in Q4 than they were in Q3? I don't really have the specific numbers in front of me at the moment, but just from having my finger somewhat on the pulse, I am very comfortable that the underwriting environment for the lines that you're referring to is every bit as healthy in Q4 as it was earlier in the year, possibly better. And there's nothing that leads me to believe that that momentum is going to diminish. And quite frankly, it's just simply being driven by loss costs and the environment, which, appropriately, I think, is making people focus on it more and more. So we feel like we're in a good place.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nOkay, great. Thanks. That's encouraging. And then maybe if I could just move to the accident year loss ratio ex-cat. So if I look at the improvement year-over-year, I was wondering, and I know this is getting a little bit granular, but I think the prior period had some fire losses in there. Was the improvement really just the absence of those fire losses? And are we sort of at a clean baseline here going forward?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, do you want to speak to that?\n\nRichBaio - Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure, Rob. I would say yes. It is certainly part of the reason for the change. Quarter-over-quarters, we certainly, over the last few quarters, as Rob has alluded to, I think on some of the earlier calls, been making some changes with regards to re-underwriting some of the property risk side of things. And so, yes, there has been an improvement. Certainly, much progress has been made. Can't say that it's completely completed, but certainly do I anticipate a better position going forward.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

Just a couple from me on - from an insurance growth standpoint. First one just on professional lines. I guess I was kind of hoping that as we started lapping some of those comps from when this first started a year ago, maybe we'd see a little bit better growth. But it looked like growth was down again even after being down last year in the fourth quarter. Is that not the right way to think about it? Is this a line that based on where market conditions are\u2026\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAre you speaking specifically about professional? Sorry, Ryan. Trying to make sure....\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nProfessional lines, yes, I'm just trying to understand like....\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. The skinny on that, at least through, in my opinion, is the D&O market, particularly public D&O market has been, from a pricing perspective, in somewhat of free fall, and rates went up considerably, and now they're coming back down. And then we have a view as to what rate adequacy is. And ultimately, while we're sorry to see it go, if it goes, it goes. We're not going to chase it down the drain. In addition to D&O, a couple of other product lines that I would call out would be medical professional, specifically hospital professional liability, where the lack of discipline in that product line over the past, quite frankly, a couple of years, I think, has given reason to pause. To our colleagues credit, they also - they have been operating with the discipline. So that's quite frankly having an impact on the top line as well. Other areas that I would flag, maybe one other would be architects and engineers with some of the larger accounts where again, we have found that the market is willing to do things we don't think make sense, and the pricing has come off. So professional liability, extraordinarily broad category, just trying to give you a little bit of a flavor with some of the bigger pieces of that puzzle. But yes, there are some areas within the professional space that we still find notably attractive, particularly nonstandard. And then there are some big chunks of the professional line, some of which I just referenced, that I think should be giving anyone who's responsible and disciplined real reason to pause.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

In addition to that, as we see rate adequacy more and more attractive, then we're going to lean into that. And you would take note the growth, for example, in short tail lines or specifically property in the reinsurance business during the '23 year. And of course, we had meaningful growth on the property front and the E&S space as well, both through our domestic businesses as well as through our London operation.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it, So, I guess, how is like, your outlook for the type of cat exposure you have?

I mean, as I said a few moments ago, the majority of our growth is driven by rate. So there's a lot of things where our exposure hasn't changed, but we're charging considerably more. But also, that has led to opportunity to write some additional business as well. But I don't have a specific breakout on the 20% what's rate versus exposure.

Is it going to be quite as attractive as 23? Perhaps not, but I think that even if it isn't, that doesn't mean it's no longer an attractive opportunity. So we, as far as property cat goes in a very measured way, continue to be bullish on the opportunity.

Brian, I think that - I think, I'm happy to share that with you, but I want to check with our General Counsel to make sure that I'm allowed to share that with you. But what I know I can share with you is that our general view on the property cat market at 1/1 was that it was still very attractive, maybe not quite as attractive as it was at 1/1/23, or said differently, I think the market is still very attractive, but I also believe it has peaked, at least for the moment.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nOkay, interesting. And then I guess my next question. Rob, and we talked a little bit about this earlier. The ceded reinsurance program and your flexibility there. I'm just curious, is this kind of the time in the market that maybe you do want it to retain more of that business just because rates are quite adequate, your operating leverage is still relatively low compared to history? Why wouldn't you kind of just lean in here and retain more of it?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAnd - there are parts of the business that we are grappling with exactly those questions. Ultimately, the reinsurance marketplace, from our perspective, is that there are some people that are our partners through thick and thin, and there are some people where it's much more of a transactional relationship. Those that are our partners through thick and thin, we are not likely going to cut them off, if you will. Those that are more transactional in nature, we come to the table recognizing we are renting their capital, and we have a choice whether we're going to use our own or whether we're going to rent theirs. And my colleagues are pretty good at doing the math and we try and figure out what makes sense. So are there parts of the business where if the reinsurance marketplace were to push us, we might exercise that option of keeping more for exactly the reasons that you're flagging?\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):\nGot you. Thanks. And then can I ask one big picture question? I'm just curious. If I look at the industry and the commercial lines and the combined ratios and margins that companies have been reporting, and you've been pretty consistent the last couple of years, but they're about as good as they've ever been, right? I mean, at least in 2025 years. So I guess my question then is with the client pushback there, with the broker pushback, when you're kind of trying to push for incremental rate, and I get it, that loss cost inflation is improving a little bit here, but the returns the industry is generating right now are incredibly attractive.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI'm not close enough to it, but I think we're using a pretty broad brush. I think that if you look back at some of the personal lines players or even some of the commercial line folks that write property books, it hasn't been necessarily a wonderful five years for them. Maybe it's better today. But when the day is all done, I think one needs to use a bit of a finer brush and really look at it at product line by product line. I think, as I suggested earlier, I think Q4 is going to be a really attractive quarter for many market participants. But I don't think 2023 proved to be this remarkable experience for all carriers. So again, do I think that the industry is in a better place today, certainly for many product lines, than it's been at other moments in time? Yes, I agree with that comment. But I think if you look at the total results for a lot of insurance companies for the '23 year, not everyone is hanging their hat on a return that starts with a two.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my call at the end. There's probably a Rich question here. I'm looking at the traditional investment income and stepped up materially $249 million in the third quarter, and you're about $280 - having $288 million, I think, change for this quarter. That's a pretty large step up and the implied yield stepped up a lot. Is there any one-time type of coupons or one-time dividends in that number, or is that a good approximation of where the yield on the book was through the fourth quarter?\n\nRichBaio - Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo we have seen a - an increase, Josh, in the overall book yield, I'd say from a fixed maturity perspective, we certainly have been able to deploy capital and reinvest at higher rates, as Rob was alluding to earlier in some of his remarks in terms of the - where the new money rate is and where the roll-off is. So certainly that's been a big contributor to it. We did have a little bit of an uptick, if you will, with regards to some securities that we own in Argentina that are inflation-adjusted as well. So that did create a little bit of an uptick. But I would tell you that the book yield in the quarter, I would say, core would be around 4.7%, which is certainly up from where we were at the end of the third quarter.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nThank you. And you spoke, Rob, about the new money yield being in excess of 5% right now.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):"

Is there intention to crystallize some of the yield at these higher yields available in the market right now?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

Different way of putting it,\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. So our desire is to move it out, but we're going to move it out when we see the window of opportunity. So would we like to see that move out to '25, '26, '27 over time? Yes, we would. But we're going to do that in a way that makes sense. So I would encourage you to stay tuned. And we're - there's a lot of volatility in the world, and when we see the things working with us, we're going to try and lean into that window, but we're just trying to roll with the punches. And again, it's remarkable volatility.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd one last investment-oriented question. Given the macro outlook for things at this point in time, does it make sense to lean in and perhaps contribute more of the portfolio to the investment fund type of investments?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nActually, I think at this stage, quite to the contrary, we're very pleased with what this traditional fixed income portfolio is offering us. And I think, just as a general mix, while we - I don't see us exiting alternatives, I don't think that there's the same level of encouragement or it's not as compelling to look in the alternative directions as it once was given where fixed income rates still are.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

Just first question, just looking at the property market, so sounds like maybe a seat, but still pretty attractive returns there. I think you guys have gone through some remediation efforts on the property book as well. I guess with that in mind as we look at '24, if your costs correctly, you're still thinking of growing that book more through rate than through exposures, is that correct? Why not lean more into exposure?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI want to draw a distinction. First off, as far as things peaking, that comment was suggested that they may be peaking in the property cat market. And I'd like to draw a distinction between the primary or insurance market versus the reinsurance market. And in addition to that, I would suggest that it's important to draw a distinction between the property cat market versus the property risk reinsurance market because they are clearly not one in the same in our opinion. As far as our desire to grow the business, look, if we like the margin, we are going to lean into it. And I think that at the moment, generally speaking, we like the opportunity that continues to exist in the reinsurance marketplace when it comes to property. And we are certainly paying attention to a lot of the opportunity that exists in the primary property insurance space, particularly as it relates to E&S in the commercial lines. And of course, not to be forgotten, our colleagues at Berkeley, one on the high net worth front, the opportunity for rate, both on the admitted basis as well as, just as a reminder, they are using non-admitted paper as well, is creating meaningful opportunity also.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question, and I'm not sure if you'd be willing to answer this at this stage, but...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWhen in doubt, ask.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):\nI'll try. The - when we see the 10-K and maybe even the scheduled P later on in the year and we look at the results from this quarter, would we see a similar trend to what we've seen so far year to date? Namely, maybe some strengthening in liability reserves of older vintages offset by favorable releases in 2020 through '22?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think directionally, yes, you will see that. Do I think that we are very far or well on our way to having '15 through '19 behind us? Yes, I do. Do I think that it's done? Probably not. Look, we take a different approach than some other organizations when it comes to monitoring our reserves and trying to make sure that we're getting it right. There are some folks that just ignore it for quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, and then all of a sudden they have this giant problem that they need to deal with and they take this massive charge. We take a different approach. Our view is we're looking at it every 90 days or more frequently and we're tweaking it to where we think it needs to be, and we think that that's the more sensible approach. So again, you'll see the information, but I think that we continue to be very optimistic about the more recent years and how that's going to play out. Do I - clearly, some of that good news has been used along the way as we've had some challenges coming out of the older years. I think, again, those challenges are in the rear view mirror and shrinking by the minute. And I think there continues to be a lot of encouraging signs, as I referenced earlier, around the amount of IBNR we continue to carry in some of the more recent years.\n\nYaron Kinar - Analyst (Jefferies):"

Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAudra, thank you very much and let me echo your words earlier with a warm welcome to all that are participating in the call today. We appreciate your time and look forward to discussing with you our Q1 2024 results. In addition to myself, we also have Bill Berkley on the call, Executive Chairman and Rich Baio, Chief Financial Officer and we are going to follow our typical agenda where I am going to be handing it over to Rich shortly. He will be running through some highlights, once he is completed his comments, I'll follow along with a few additional thoughts and then we will be pleased to open it up for questions, comments, discussion. But before I do hand it over to Rich, I think anyone who's had an opportunity to flip through the earnings release would understand already. But I'll say it regardless, that we had a very strong and solid quarter, great way to start the year. And when you really look at the results and unpack it a little bit, as we'll be doing over the next hour or so, it's pretty clear that the business is firing on many cylinders or essentially all cylinders at this stage. Rich again will get into some details and while there are a couple of moving pieces in the investment portfolio that merit some conversation or discussion, I think the overall story is that whether it's on the investment side or on the underwriting side, business continues to benefit from the foundation that was poured yesterday. We continue to pour it today and position the business for continued success. This is really a result of the whole team and in particular, I think it's worth noting that the level of expertise, the focus and as important as anything, the discipline that exists on both the underwriting part of the business, as well as the investment part of the business. So for us, we're pleased with the quarter. Rich is going to give you some more detail on it. In addition to that, we're probably even more enthusiastic because of how we see the business unfolding, not just for the balance of this year, but with every passing day we are laying the groundwork for what 2025 and beyond will look like as well. So with that, let me hand it to Rich and he will share with us some of his thoughts on the quarter. Rich, good morning.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThanks, Rob. Appreciate it. As you mentioned, we're off to a terrific start in 2024, with record quarterly operating income driven by record net investment income and our best first quarter underwriting income. Operating income increased 53.4% to $423 million or $1.56 per share, with an annualized operating return on beginning of year equity of 22.7%. Net income increased 50.4% to $442 million or $1.64 per share, with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 23.7%. Our growth in net premiums written accelerated to 10.7% to a record of almost $2.9 billion. Rate improvement and exposure growth continue to contribute to the increase in our top line. Before discussing the segment results, we reclassified a program management business from the insurance segment to the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment. This reclassified business has similar characteristics to one of our reinsurance operations already in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment and has common management for both operations. And accordingly, reclassifications have been made to the company's 2023 financial information to conform this presentation. Having said that, the insurance segment increased net premiums written by a 11.9% to more than $2.4 billion and the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 4.2% to more than $400 million. Pretax underwriting income increased 31.8% to $309 million and our calendar year combined ratio improved 1.8 points from the prior year to 88.8%. The current accident year combined ratio ex cats was flat year-over-year at 87.7%. A reduction in the current accident year catastrophe losses contributed to a benefit of 80 basis points to the calendar year loss ratio of 60.2%. Cat losses were $31 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the current quarter versus $48 million or 1.9 loss ratio points in the first quarter of 2023. Combining this improvement along with the prior year favorable development of approximately $1 million brings our first quarter 2024 accident year loss ratio ex cats to 59.1%. The slight uptick in the ratio from the prior year is due to business mix. Expense ratio improved 20 basis points to 28.6% due to a non-recurring benefit associated with compensation. We remain confident that our 2024 full year expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%, even with the previously announced new start-up operating unit expenses. Pretax net investment income grew 43.2% to a record $320 million in the current quarter. Our core portfolio increased more than 63%, which was influenced by Argentine inflation linked securities. We don't expect the remainder of 2024 to benefit as significantly from much of these securities which have matured in the first quarter. Partially offsetting this benefit is a loss of $29 million from investment funds. As you may recall, we report investment funds on a one quarter lag and since our first quarter represents the fourth quarter of the year for investment funds, we believe their mark-to-market process is more rigorous due to financial statement audits. The two primary fund strategies for the current quarter's loss were transportation and financial services. To synthesize this down for the second quarter of 2024, we expect investment funds will have less impact from mark-to-market and perform more like they did in the fourth quarter of 2023, as we expect the Argentine inflation linkers to do as well. We had very strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the first quarter, an increase of almost 68% compared with last year. The combination of new money rate above the roll off yields on our fixed maturity portfolio and increasing investable asset base, the company is well positioned for a future investment income growth. In addition, credit quality of the portfolio remains at a AA minus, duration increased from 2.4 years to 2.5 years in the first quarter. The effective tax rate increased to 23% in the first quarter and we expect this to remain elevated throughout 2024 when compared to the prior year. The amount of foreign income and its contribution to the global earnings of the company at tax rates greater than 21% statutory rate in the U.S. will likely result in a higher annual expected effective tax rate. Our stockholders equity remains very strong at a record $7.8 billion, despite an increase in unrealized losses and currency translation losses of $98 million in the quarter. Book value per share was $30.34 at quarter end, an increase of 4.4% from year en"

With that, Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. Rich, thank you. So, let me start with a few sort of comments on the marketplace and then I'll offer a few further observations on our quarter. So perhaps a place to begin would be bifurcating between insurance versus reinsurance, which obviously the markets are related, but they're not one in the same and starting with insurance maybe calling out E&S as a part of the market. I think there's been some commentary around perhaps E&S is losing some momentum and I would suggest that one needs to use, at least through my lens, somewhat of a finer brush. As far as we can see, the momentum for the liability lines is -- continues to be as strong as ever. To the extent you're seeing any slowing in the momentum of E&S, it's likely to be property related. As far as the property market in general, when it comes to insurance, we think that it still does have some momentum, but it probably does not have the level of momentum that it had last year. We're still seeing rates moving up and we expect they will continue to move up for the immediate future. That having been said, I think part of what you're seeing is the insurance marketplace catching up to what the reinsurance marketplace had taken action around and their costs of the capacity the rent has gone up. As far as GL, again, from our perspective, it remains very robust, both admitted and non-admitted and no surprise, it's the social inflation continuing to persist that is driving that. Just on the topic of social inflation auto, which as I think I've commented on in the past, continues to be very much in the crosshairs of social inflation. We think that, that is part of the market that you're going to see considerable additional firming going on, specifically in commercial auto. Excess and umbrella, particularly to the extent that it relates to the commercial auto market, you are going to see additional firming there as well. Workers compensation, we have offered our more defensive view around that. And of course, as far as professional liability goes, we have called out D&O where obviously some number of years it spiked. More recently it has been dropping at somewhat of a precipitous rate. And at this stage, we view that it is not bottomed, but it is closing in on the bottom. Pivoting to reinsurance, barring what Mother Nature may do tomorrow, it would seem as though the property cat cycle has run a bit of its course. From our perspective, rates were off for property cat reinsurance at 1.1, 5% or more risk adjusted. And, you know, we'll have to see how that unfolds. That having been said, we are seeing some potential green shoots of discipline returning to the liability market within under the umbrella of reinsurance. We have been reasonably outspoken about our concerns around discipline over the past couple of years within the liability or the reinsurance liability market and we will see what comes of that. Turning to our quarter top line, just shy of a 11%. As you would have noted in the release, we are pleased with the rate increase that we got at the 7.8%, which in our opinion is comfortably outpacing trend in the aggregate. And the renewal retention ratio continues to be at approximately 80%, which is what we would expect. The strength in the insurance growth, as Rich referenced, just shy of 13% is quite strong. Property in particular was a contributor as we take advantage of that market opportunity. And again, in keeping with my comments about market conditions on the reinsurance front, you would have seen us continuing to exercise discipline when it comes to the casualty or liability lines. As far as our loss ratio goes, clearly a good performance in the quarter and we believe that the stage is set for a good balance of the year, as well as increasingly what we should be expecting for 2025 and beyond. Just as a data point that I share from time-to-time because I think it's a helpful indicator or certainly a truth that we can all hang our hat on. During the quarter, our paid loss ratio was a 45.8, which is the second lowest it's been in the past eight years and the only time it was lower, it was lower by 50 basis points. So we are in a very comfortable place on that front. Just on the topic of losses, maybe spending a few moments on the topic of loss reserves and I think there's a shared appreciation for the challenges that stem from just to put a stake in the ground 19 and prior and what that may mean. From our perspective, I think that we are well on our way, as I suggested to some, to having that behind us. The averaged life of our reserves is just inside of four years, so at this stage that period is getting very much towards the tail end, is there perhaps a little bit out there still? We'll see what time it's possible, but certainly our expectation is that much of it has been processed, if you will. I think a few other data points that are worth noting at least we find them to be helpful as leading indicators when it comes to strength of reserves and putting aside the comment about paid losses, we would encourage people to consider having a look at IBNR as a percent of total reserves, the ratio of IBNR to case reserves and while some people may look at those two data points and say, well, you know, they could be impacted by the growth in the business and certainly there would be that reality to a certain extent, though I would suggest that people should look more carefully at how much of our growth was coming from rate. That all having been said, there is another data point that we look to and we would encourage others to consider as well and that is initial IBNR as a percent of net premium earned. I think all of these data points that I and drawn to your attention to are worth your consideration and I think would suggest the -- this our reserves are in a improving a good place and more likely than not continuing to improve and we will see that mature over time. As far as the expenses go, Rich walk through that. In particular, I would just call out that we had four businesses that had been in their infancy and the first quarter of this year is the first time we pulled them into the expense ratio and we're pleased to see how they are developing and maturing. On the investment portfolio, Rich had walked you through this as well, but a couple of highlights from my perspective, he referenced the AA minus and it happens to be a very strong AA minus, so there could be a lot of credit activity and we would still be in a very comfortable place. As Rich flagged the duration, it nudged out from 2.4 to 2.5. Do we continue to look for opportunities to nudge it out? Yes, absolutely. Do we feel any pressure that we need to do that overnight? Absolutely not. The book yield as Rich referenced or maybe he didn't, I'll be referencing now was 5.9%, but if you back out the Argentine component, the book yield is actually 4.2%. I think that's relevant because when we talk about how we're sort of laying the ground for the future here or what one should expect going forward with our sort of core domestic portfolio, which is the lion's share of what we have at 4.2% and a new money rate that's somewhere between 5.25 and 5.50. I think that combined with the strength of our cash flow should give you a sense as to the earnings power of the business and the contribution that we will be receiving from the investment portfolio, which again, I think there's considerable upside from here, again with the domestic core fixed income portfolio, that's 100 basis points plus upside from here. So when you, you put it all together, I think that we have been thoughtful and prudent on the under"

In addition to that, as I just suggested, as it relates to the other part of our economic model, our investment portfolio, very well positioned, benefiting from the focus and the discipline and the opportunity to take advantage of a new money rate that is 100 basis points above where our book yield of our core portfolio will prove to be very advantageous.

That having been said, there was nothing material or consequential to the portfolio overall as far as changes during 2023.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, got it. You know, in your prepared remarks, Rob, in the beginning, it sounded like, you know, you're just as optimistic or maybe more optimistic about the -- how the portfolio is coming together than you were last quarter. I guess, you know, pricing power, you know, I know it's just a quarter doesn't make a trend, looks like it's kind of flattish. Are you --- are we still kind of on the view that top line growth is likely to be in the low double digits for the year? Or do you think things could play out a bit better, especially if pricing on the cash flow side for the industry starts to move a bit north?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nMy best guesstimate at this stage and that's with a capital G is that we should be able to grow the business all, given what I see between 10% and 15%. As Mike, I know you're aware of and we all presumably have a shared appreciation. We have 60 different businesses, all focused on different niches within the marketplace. And at any moment in time, there are parts of the market that we participate in that are improving and there are parts of the market that are facing more of a headwind. One of the things, again, as I think we've discussed in the past is that once upon a time, these product lines marched in lockstep, at this stage, they have seemed to be decoupling more and more every day. So there'll be some puts and there'll be some takes, but overall, I think that there's a better than average chance that we can grow between 10% and 15% for the foreseeable future. Could there be a quarter that we come in shy of that? Yes. Could there be a quarter that we exceed that? Yes, but that's sort of the channel markers I would offer you.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. And just lastly, on property, I feel like there was a couple of comments made. You said that maybe that's an area that could lose a bit of pricing momentum in the E&S marketplace, given it's a more, you know, my words, a little bit more commoditized line in terms of ability for people to come in and out. But then you also said, you know, you're, you know, you think you've been growing into property a bit over time. So just want to be clear, do you still feel like property is an area that over the course of the year, you know, returns are good that Berkley which is underweight can play more offense?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLook, so let maybe just to bifurcate it a little bit between insurance and reinsurance. So, first off, I think that one needs to understand just because pricing is peaked, that doesn't mean there's not still good margin to have. So if you look at our reinsurance business and the opportunity that we still see in property, we view it as still a healthy line. That having been said, barring the unforeseen event, we think that property cat specifically has perhaps seen the peak we'll see with time. Obviously, the reinsurance marketplace has an impact on the insurance market, when reinsurance costs are up, then obviously that there is a trickle through or a waterfall effect for the insurance market and there is a little bit of a delay in that. So, the reinsurance market, which force the firming, I think, is out ahead. I think there's still margin to be had there, I think the impact that it's had on the insurance market is still very real, as the insurance market is still coming to grips with that higher cost of capacity that they rent from the reinsurance marketplace. But I don't think that there is the same level of pressure in or urgency in the insurance marketplace in particular E&S that we saw or felt a year ago. That doesn't mean there's not still opportunity. That doesn't mean we don't still like the margin and don't still want to have a second helping of whatever the market can offer. We have a view as to what adequate rate is in order to achieve the risk adjusted return that we think is appropriate. Right now, we think that opportunity, generally speaking, still exists in property. How quickly that will dissipate? I don't know, but we play close attention to it and we will not have an issue shutting off the spigot if we don't think it is a good use of capital going forward.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

So it's what I would describe as somewhat of a recent phenomenon that is a reflection of the shift in the political environment. As far as data points go, Richie, I know that in your comments, you alluded to what we saw in the -- I guess it would have been the fourth quarter of last year, which was really the, I think one of the first meaningful contributions or impacts that we saw and we saw an even greater impact in the fourth quarter and we'll see how it unfolds from here. Rich, do you want to just spend a moment, maybe sharing with Josh and others that may be interested in just what has transpired with these linked securities in Argentina?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W.

If we were to look to the prior period, a year earlier, if you will, just to show an appreciation for the increase in the domestic portfolio, that would have been around 3.6%. So certainly saw some pick-up there in regards to our overall yield. We did have a majority of our Argentine positions mature in the first quarter. And so for that reason, that's why we're saying that we would not anticipate the same level of investment income that we saw in the first quarter of this year, but would anticipate that we would get back down to a more leveled basis, as it relates to the Latin American portfolio in the second quarter and it will continue to decrease as the remainder of those inflation linkers mature throughout the remainder of this year.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nSo given that sort of situation, if we think about the amount of portfolio that matured this year or was preempted by a sale of investments, it was no different than in prior quarters. We can look at the sort of the trajectory on where investment income has gone, excluding 1Q and think about that might be a way to think about, as we head to a 5.5% yield on the overall portfolio, that it will continue along a trajectory towards that path?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that's a fairly reasonable approach, Josh, yes.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nOkay. And just on the reserve releases, you know, historically, you tend to be pretty conservative in your portfolio, not releasing a lot of reserves, sometimes there's one-off course where it happened. What happened in this quarter that made you feel that there was a reason to throw off some reserves here?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, we -- as I think we've discussed in the past, we look at our reserves a variety of different ways by each one of the operations that makes up the group by product line at a very granular level. We also look at it at the aggregate as well, the group level and we assess where we are and what we need and what tweaking needs to happen. I think there tend to be some folks that tend to maybe not try and tweak as regularly as we do, but we are constantly looking at it and trying to make sure that we're not getting the porridge too hot or too cold. So at any moment in time, there's 60 different moving pieces, but we feel as though that things are in a good place.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAll right, I'll come up with some harder questions, come offline, but I appreciate the disclosure.

And maybe just a little color in terms of the movement between lines and accident years?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure, David, to make a long story short, the amount of movement from each one of the two segments was what I would define relative to the overall reserve position of each segment, let alone the aggregate, one could say is immaterial. And as far as the development goes, if you wouldn't mind just catching up with Karen on those details. But there wasn't anything out of the ordinary and from based on what I have the sheet that I have in front of me, but why don't you catch up with Karen and she can try and give you a little bit more detail on that. But if your question is, are we taking lots of reserves out of the current year or the more recent year? No, the answer is, we're not.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nUnderstood, that...\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAnd a reminder, our life of our reserves is just inside of four years and the incurred tail is inside of three years.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just following-up on that, just looking at the accident year loss ratio ex cat in the insurance business, assuming negligible PYD to sort of back into that, it looks like it deteriorated around 100 basis points year-on-year. I'm wondering, was there any change that you guys made to loss trend or anything on the mix side that you would just call out as sort of pushing that up?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRichie, is there anything that you recall?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think certainly with social inflation, some of our loss picks maybe are slightly higher than where they had been the year earlier, but it really is just a mix of the business that's just rising that.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes and probably the areas, well, not probably the areas that we are looking hardest at the picks would be around commercial auto and it's less that we have concerns about prior year, it's more that we just have concerns about the environment and where it seems to be today and where we expect it's going tomorrow, we've got to keep up with that.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):"

My first question is just in terms of the flow of business you guys are seeing with the E&S market. We saw some stamping capacity out of three of the largest E&S states turned negative in March, which I recognize is only one month of data. But just curious what you're seeing with the flow to the E&S market and any color you have just on what we saw in those three states in March?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo I'm not familiar with the data, Elyse, that perhaps you have in front of you. But speaking to our experience, we continue to see during the first quarter very robust activity on the E&S front, particularly on the casualty or liability. In general property, there continues to be an opportunity. But again, I think it's probably not what it was a year ago. And I think that that's just the reality of things and the cycle. So we are more of a liability shop than a property shop though we do participate in property. I expect that we'll try and make some more hay and property before we call it a day, but it is possible that, that may have not peaked, but property is peaking. On the liability front, there is nothing that leads me to believe that the momentum is going to be subsiding anytime soon. I think the reality is that social inflation, the legal environment, the social environment persists and that continues to drive lost costs. And I think that there's some reasonable chance that the reinsurance marketplace is becoming more acutely aware of this social inflation issue and you're going to see them look for opportunity to try and put pressure on the insurance marketplace when it comes to like casualty and liability lines like they did on the property front. As it relates to us, we are less exposed or susceptible to that because we are a small limits player, approximately 90% of our policies that are legally allowed to have a limit have a limit of $2 million or less. So we are not as exposed to the whims of the reinsurance market, but we look forward to the reinsurance market embracing greater discipline on the casualty lines.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then going back to one of the prior questions on the loss ratio, I guess, you know, within insurance, I know you guys mentioned mix driving that up and it sounds like there's, you know, nothing else going on there except, you know, some prudence you pointed to within the picks around commercial auto. So given that you guys have these designed loss ratios, would you expect like the underlying loss ratio over the balance of the year in insurance to be pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that we will continue to look at the business and the data and how we think things are performing. And, Elyse, hopefully you would expect we will respond accordingly. So that's the best I can do, sorry, if it's not good enough.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nNo, that is good enough. And one last one on workers comp. Anything that you're seeing there, I know at times you kind of called for a floor and a turn and obviously that's been good opportunities for folks for a while and I know that business for you guys, we did see a little bit of a decline in the Q1, but how are you thinking about the comp market not only in 2024, but also going into 2025 as well?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nMy colleagues and I -- we continue to have a view that frequency remains the industry's friend and we along with others have benefited from that, but are sensitive to or maybe I would take a step further and suggest concerned about medical costs and where they are likely going and there's a delay there. So are we at the bottom? It would seem as though my calling the bottom, I was just, some might say early, others might just say wrong. That having been said, I think we are seeing more signs of California bottoming out and the rest of the country or much of the rest of the country is probably a pace or two behind.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

So just, I guess on this E&S point, if we do get into an environment where business starts to flow from E&S back to admitted. Can you just talk about, I guess, the capability of your business to be able to write it on admitted paper as well? And I would guess you'd have better capability to do that on the casualty side than the property side.

So, yes, just curious on your thoughts?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRyan, thanks for the question and long story short, obviously we have both the tools and the expertise to write both non-admitted and admitted. I mean, ultimately what it really boils down to is when some of those exposures make their way back into the standard market is that something that we think is a sensible use of our capital, when the standard market, if it were to become more competitive at that time, do we still think that it's a good use of capital? So do we have the ability to do it? Yes, but we'll need to look at the pricing, the terms and conditions and my colleagues will have to reach a conclusion as to whether they think it's sensible or not. So the tools and the capabilities, yes and colleagues will have to decide whether it makes sense or not.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. And then switching gears, I guess, thinking about the expense ratio, I guess just looking at the model this morning, this cycle, there's been more underlying combined ratio improvement on the expense ratio than there's been on the loss ratio, which is a good thing, assuming it's sticky. You've obviously talked about a sub-30 combined, but you didn't used to have that. So I'm just -- want to clarify which is that short term guidance or is like this type of expense ratio level plus or minus a point what you think you can do serve in perpetuity?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOur expectation is that it's going to start with a two indefinitely. Is it possible there could be some extraordinary something or other that could change that? Yes, of course. But at this stage, you know, we feel that we are in a good place and that this is very sustainable.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

You know, that's become perhaps a more complicated question than it once was because of what we've seen happen with wildfire and SCS over the past several years. So I don't have a percentage for you as to what's exposed to quake or particularly as we get earth quake apparently now in the northeast or exactly what is exposed to wind. We're happy to pick up the conversation offline, but we have a view that cat load has had to evolve from how people thought about it just a few years ago.

We appreciate you getting us through that marathon of a safe harbor statement. And good afternoon to all, and welcome to our Q2 call. Thank you for finding the time, and thank you for the interest in the company. Along with me on the call, you have Bill Berkley, Executive Chair, as well as Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the group. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily I'll be handing it over to Rich, he'll run through some highlights for you all, he'll then flip it back to me, I'll offer a few of my own observations on both the industry as well as our quarter, and then we'll be pleased to open it up for Q&A. Before I hand it to Rich, I guess perhaps stating the obvious, clearly an active quarter of frequency of what I would define as severity, but perhaps relatively modest severity on the property front. From our perspective, it was an opportunity for this organization to differentiate itself as it does when there is severity on the property market front. And in spite of all the challenges, we were still able to deliver a 91% combined. I guess for those that subscribe to the [but for] (ph) club, it would be an 88%. But when we look at the goal of the exercise being to generate good risk-adjusted returns to build the book value, we are of the view that cats do count and so does net development. In our opinion, it's not just about the steps forward that you take, it's also about the steps backwards that you will avoid. And that is very much woven into how we approach the business on all fronts. So with that, I will hand it to Rich, and I will follow him in a couple of minutes. Rich, if you would, please.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOf course. Thanks, Rob, and good evening, everyone. The company continues to perform well with a second quarter annualized return on beginning of year equity of 20% on a net income basis and 22.4% on an operating earnings basis. References to per share information in my comments and the earnings release have been adjusted for the 3-for-2 common stock split effected on July 10. Operating income increased approximately 35% to $418 million or $1.04 per share, driven by strong underwriting and investment income. Growth of 11.2% in net premiums written to a record $3.1 billion represents the first time above $3 billion for a quarter, and provides the opportunity for continued record setting net premiums earned beyond this quarter. The US dollar strengthens to many foreign currencies in the quarter, adversely impacting the growth rate by approximately 90 basis points, and accordingly would have been 12.1% excluding the foreign currency impact. We grew in both segments of our business, led by the Insurance segment with 12.2% growth unadjusted for foreign currency, and the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment increased 3.5% led by property. Pre-tax underwriting income was $254 million, which included $90 million of catastrophe losses or 3.2 loss ratio points. Heightened catastrophe events during the quarter led to the increase in cat losses of 1.1 loss ratio points over the prior-year quarter, well below what we would expect will impact the industry. Our careful and prudent management of cat risks has continued to result in stability in earnings. Our accident year loss ratio, excluding cats, is at 59.4%, slightly below the prior year's 59.5%. The prior-year accident development was favorable by $1 million, combined with the previously mentioned cat losses brings our calendar year loss ratio to 62.6%. The expense ratio increased 40 basis points to 28.5%, primarily due to higher commissions from business mix and is relatively flat to the sequential quarter. We remain confident with our guidance that the expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%. Record pre-tax net investment income increased almost 52% to $372 million. The fixed maturity securities continue to drive results quarter-over-quarter with an increase of more than $100 million. In addition, net investment income from investment funds improved to $25 million in the quarter. The record operating cash flow through the first six months of $1.6 billion, combined with the ability to reinvest the roll-off of existing securities at higher yields, should continue to drive growth in net investment income quarter-over-quarter for the foreseeable future. The credit quality of the investment portfolio and duration remains at AA- and 2.5 years for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.7%, and will likely remain at this level throughout the remainder of the year due to the contribution of foreign earnings taxed at rates greater than the US statutory rate of 21%. Turning to capital management, the company returned total capital of $381 million, consisting of $224 million of share repurchases, $127 million of special dividends and $30 million of regular dividends. Stockholders' equity increased [4.3%] (ph) from the beginning of the year to $7.8 billion, while book value per share of $20.42 grew 5.4% over the same period. Book value per share before share repurchases and dividends grew 4.7% in the quarter and 9.7% on a year-to-date basis. With that, Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. Thanks, Rich. That was great. A couple of comments from me, maybe starting on the more macro and the industry and then we can touch on our quarter as promised. So, from my perspective, the industry continues to be one that responds to pain. Pain is the catalyst for discipline and change. We see that from one product to another. I guess perhaps one analogy would be the cast may change, but generally speaking, the script does not change. Unfortunately, it's somewhat predictable. Speaking of change, certainly, we are seeing a bit of a tempering on the financial and economic inflation front. That having been said, social inflation shows no sign of abating. Social inflation is something that we have been very actively and loudly talking about going back to 2018 when we started to wave our arms and share with people what we were seeing in loss trend. One of the challenges, particularly as of late, and it's really in much of the country is there's a bit of resistance to in amongst many insurance departments and allowing carriers to get rate filings that they need to keep up with loss cost trend. That consequently has been creating and continued to create an opportunity in the specialty lines, in particular the E&S lines as the standard market is not able to get their rates to where they need to be, again, given what trend is driven by social inflation. I'm not going to get into every no"

I'm not going to get into every nook and cranny of every major commercial line, but I will flag that auto liability continues to be an area of concern, and obviously, by extension that can feed into the umbrella line. From our perspective, when you talk about social inflation, there is no product line that is more exposed than auto liability these days. Turning to our quarter, as Rich covered earlier, I would just point out the gross was up by 11.4%. As he mentioned, the net was up by 11.2%. The big delta there was a couple of fold. One was, at captive business, which continues to do exceptionally well. A few new operations that we started and when they're in their infancy and don't have much balance to them, we'll maybe be a bit more dependent on the reinsurance buy. And lastly, there was a moment post 1/1, but before everyone started to turn their attention to what could be a very active win season, the ILW market softened a little bit and we took advantage of that. As Rich mentioned, the 11.2% on the top-line was reasonably healthy growth. The rate coming in at 8.3% ex comp from our perspective should give comfort to others as it gives to us that we are keeping up with trend. That having been said, rate's important, but it's not the whole story. One needs to be conscious of what's happening with terms and conditions. And history would remind all of us that oftentimes terms and conditions can have a greater impact than rate on the outcome of underwriting. In addition to that, something that we talk about from time to time, but it's coming into sharper and sharper focus, and that is how there are certain territories or jurisdictions or venues that as far as a legal environment or a legal climate are changing and changing very rapidly. So, there are certain territories that once upon a time politically were red and that would spill over to the legal environment. We are seeing those change. And I wouldn't say that they're bright blue, but they are certainly evolving to something that's more of a shade of purple from our perspective. Rich touched on the expense ratio, again, reasonably stable there. Obviously, as he had mentioned earlier in the year and again touched on in his comments a few moments ago, new businesses that we started that are in their infancy are now incorporated into that until they get their critical mass, they're a bit of a drag on the expense side. And in addition to that, we are making some pretty chunky investments on the tech front as well as the data and analytics front. Loss ratio, the 62.6%, again, not bad given the time of year and what's going on with SCS and related. That having been said, we are always looking to try and improve upon that. There's a lot of chatter in the marketplace at the moment around losses and specifically around reserves. Look, when the day is all done, there's a one of the great challenges of this industry is you sell your product before you know your cost of goods sold. None of us know what tomorrow will bring. None of us know what a jury is going to do. That having been said, as we have commented countless times over the past several years, particularly in light of the commentary, the questioning and occasionally the chastising that we've received for in spite of all the rate we've gotten, how is it that you are not dropping our [losses] (ph). Our response has been consistently that we have a respect for the unknown. We have an appreciation for what's going on with social inflation. And consequently early on we are going to hold our picks at a higher level and they will season out over time as we have more information. A couple of data points that I thought could be possibly helpful is the paid loss ratio continues to run-in the mid-40%. When we look back at how much rate we have gotten since 2019, all lines ex comp on the insurance front are approximately 68% that's cumulative of course. And finally, another data point since some people have suggested that the paid loss ratio only tells part of the story because your business is growing. I'd add to that much of the business, its growth has been due to rate, but nevertheless, I would suggest that people could look at a different data point if it would be helpful to them that being initial IBNR relative to net earned premium. And if you go back in time and you look at that data, which we have, if you look at sort of the '16 to '19 period, that was running at somewhere between 31% and 34% ish. If you look at '20 to '23, that's running between 37.5% and 39%. So, as people think about the strength of our loss reserves, perhaps that would be a helpful data point. Pivoting over to the investment portfolio, Richie touched on this earlier, duration 2.5, strong AA-. The domestic book yield coming in at 4.5% and the new money rate, in spite of all the chatter around interest rates and where they're going so on and so forth, still starts with a 5%. And I would tell you it's probably flirting with 5.25% these days. Cash flow remains strong for the quarter with $880 million, $1.6 billion for the first half of the year. Maybe taking a half a step back and a little more of a macro front, I think some people have taken note that we played it reasonably well in how we positioned things for this rising interest rate environment. And after the quick acknowledgment of that, I think attention quickly turns to, so what are you doing now? What are you doing to make sure you set the table appropriately for tomorrow? And to make a long story short, we have a view that regardless of who ends up in the White House and regardless of who's sitting in what seat in Washington DC, this country has a serious issue with deficit and fundamentally a serious issue with spending. So, there is nothing that leads us to believe that that is going to be curtailed anytime soon. That having been said what compounds the challenge is that some of the largest buyers of US treasuries that being foreign buyers, specifically China and Japan. It's reasonably apparent that they, along with other foreign buyers, the appetite may not be there. So, when you put all of this together, our view is that even if short-term rates come down, you are likely to see the yield curve un-invert, and that will provide an opportunity for us to nudge our duration out. Obviously, around the election, there's a lot of commentary and speculation as to what leaders that will be in the White House will be doing going forward. I would just add the observation from our perspective. If we find ourselves in a situation where an administration takes a different view around immigration and we find ourselves further in a situation where certain parts of the labor market are no longer here to do those jobs. That will likely lead to greater inflation. Additionally, the idea of tariffs does quite frankly, all it does is raise the cost of products that will likely lead to inflation as well. Just pivoting quickly over to capital, Rich touched on the capital we've been returning. When the day is all done, the company at this stage for the foreseeable, we think is going to be growing at 10% to 15%. Could there be a quarter where we do a little more? A quarter we do a little less? Absolutely, but that's sort of the strike zone as we see it. But at the same time, we're generating returns and give or take high teens, low 20%s pretty consistently, and there's a lot of visibility around that from our perspective, so our ability to return capital for the foreseeable -- it's pretty robust. When you layer that on top of, I think, the view, if you take a close look at the analysis any of the rating agencies have done, we are an exceptionally strong place to begin with. So we'll have to see what tomorrow brings. But there is a lot of flexibility that the organization enjoys at th"

My first question, you hit on in your comments, right, a lot of interest in reserves these days across the industry. I know you guys said you released $1 million in the quarter. Could you just provide some more color, be it the breakdown between insurance and reinsurance or anything by accident year, just to give us a sense of what's going on within that?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWhy don't -- Rich has the insurance versus reinsurance. And if you're looking for more detail, I would suggest that if you don't mind, Elyse, just follow up with Rich and Karen and they'll give you as much detail as they're legally allowed to.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, on the Insurance segment, we developed favorably by $2.5 million. And on the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment, we developed unfavorably by $1.5 million. So that's headed down to the $1 million.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI would just add there's a lot of gives and takes on each one of those, depending on the product line. And for our purposes, we're looking at it by operating unit, by product line.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nOkay. And then maybe another one for Rich. You guys had given some guidance on the Argentinian inflation-linked securities. Where did that come in in the quarter? And do you have a sense of what that could provide in the third quarter?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, in the second quarter, we wound up reporting $63 million on inflation linkers. So, it was within the high end of the range. And then, if you were to look at a normalized level with regards to the linkers on a go-forward basis looking out over the next few quarters, we would anticipate, depending on inflation, where it goes, it could be somewhere between $20 million and $30 million.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAnd just to add to that, Rich, maybe what you were just sharing is sort of contribution and what it means on operating. If you could circle back and give Elyse a sense what it means on the net as well because of the FX fees and so on? Because I think it's important that people have the full picture on this.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAbsolutely. So, in the quarter, one of the things that you'll have noticed is that we had about $58 million of losses on I'll say a realized/unrealized capital gain perspective. There's a number of moving pieces in there. But to Rob's point, there's about $50 million of foreign currency losses that are reflected in that number. So that would offset the $63 million that we reflected in net investment income. So, on a net income basis pre-tax, you have about $13 million of impact, if you will impacting the net income. And if we were to look out into the foreseeable quarters, you'll likely see a similar situation arise where FX will largely offset the impact that's coming through on the net investment income side.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Equity Research Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And one last one. Rob, you said 8.3% rate ex workers' comp in the quarter. I think that went up 50 basis -- that went up 50 basis points sequentially. What was the driver of the increase?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):"

To the extent that -- that doesn't mean you couldn't have reserved and anticipated for, but is there another pig that the python has swallowed for the industry in '22 and '23 that the claims are coming in differently than they would have looking at the trends from the years prior?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNothing that's noteworthy from our perspective. Josh, we're not the biggest property shop that you cover, but we certainly do play in the space. And at this stage, we're not noticing any meaningful pattern of an elongation of the property claims tail.\n\nJosh Shanker - Equity Research Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd you cited, of course, the difficulties persistently with a line like commercial auto liability when you talk about how much IBNR you're putting up, are there certain lines that are getting that special IBNR focus that are driving that in particular?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think. Really what we're focused on, Josh, is the claims environment and making sure that we are acutely aware of where that is going. We have taken a tremendous amount of rate and a variety of other actions, and we continue to pay close attention to that. And when I was making the comment earlier about being sensitive to different legal venues, that would certainly apply to commercial auto or auto liability, if you like. So, when we look at that product line, are we trying to make sure that we are approaching it with the appropriate level of caution? Absolutely.\n\nJosh Shanker - Equity Research Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd if I can sneak one more in for Rich. And I guess in past quarters, we're talking about the high interest yield opportunity in fixed income markets. And I think it was said that the appetite for the proportion of income going into alternative strategies will be lower given how much money you can make in bonds, but I notice the proportion of alts has been creeping up over time. Is that just an unusual quirk? Are you seeing different opportunities in the alternative markets that you couldn't see six and twelve months ago.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, I think it's really more around commitments that we make, so as you can imagine, these are private equity like investments and so when you make an investment in a particular fund, you're committing to a certain amount of capital over time. So that's what's giving rise to the increase in the dollars that are showing up there, if that's what your question is.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nBut I would just add to Rich's comments, Josh, we are -- given where interest rates are, from our perspective, alternatives are really not of great interest to us going forward. Could there be an exception here or there? Absolutely. We are very pleased with the opportunity that the fixed income market offers, and I think you will see us continue to lean into that at this stage.\n\nJosh Shanker - Equity Research Analyst (Bank of America):"

Good afternoon.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nHey, Rob. Just curious, most of the attention on reserves has been coming from non-commercial auto actually, more recently. You've been showing and talking about kind of commercial auto continue to get increasing rate. Not that commercial auto has been a good guy for the industry in any way, but is there anything we should be reading through that you think the industry still has plenty of kind of issues to deal with, grapple with on commercial auto more so than the other non-auto...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWhat I'm trying to message Mike and probably not doing a great job, is that I think social inflation doesn't necessarily discriminate between lines. I think it is alive and well, and basically every liability line is exposed to it. That having been said, I think there are some liability lines that seem to be getting more tension from the plaintiff bar than others. From my perspective, auto liability has got the biggest bullseye on its chest. Does that mean Gl gets off scot free? Absolutely not. But that's sort of how we think about it, and that's what the data that we see would suggest.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. Switching gears a bit to the dynamics within the workers comp market. You all have been kind of clear that the profitability. Your view is that it's likely that the soft market is going to impact for profitability. And most of the commentary historically has been more on the severity side of the equation and negative pricing, but I wanted to your peers recently brought up that frequency was becoming a little less negative. I don't know if you also share that view or data that we should be thinking about the frequency component of workers' comp?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think -- how long can it be so negative for, I think, is an appropriate question. But the piece of the puzzle that we have been most preoccupied with is the medical piece. And from our perspective, the comp benefit schedules in many states has been, some would say, suppressed. Other people would say just benefited from the fact that it prices off of Medicare. Much of it prices off of Medicare. The federal government and how it approaches Medicare pricing, I think we all know, is just a mechanism for them to transfer public cost to the private sector. And comp has benefited from that. But when the day is all done, we don't think that that will happen indefinitely. When you look at other product lines like private passenger auto and you see the shift in trend around medical cost for claims, I think that that would be another data point. Mike, I think as we perhaps have talked about in the not too distant past, you can look to a state like Florida and the action that they took as it relates to benefits. So, I'm sure that it can't be a negative trend with the same pace that it's been on the frequency front indefinitely. But the -- in our opinion, one of the big wildcards out there is medical trend, and we think that that's going to come home to roost.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. And lastly, in your prepared remarks, Rob, you talked about, I might have what you said, I don't have live transcript open, but some resistance allowing carriers to kind of get the rate they need to queue up loss cost trend. I had thought that's more of a personal lines phenomenon, and you're not really much of a personal lines...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nMy comments were not focused on personal lines, though clearly to your point that it's a real issue for personal lines. We've seen it in certain states where it's proven to be really problematic and leads to a dislocation in capacity in the marketplace or availability of capacity in the marketplace. That having been said, there are many insurance departments in this country that are resistant, that, a, are not operating in a very timely manner and, b, are in some cases quite resistant to allow carriers on the commercial line side to get the rate increases they need. So, when you look at the very healthy flow of business into the specialty market and the E&S market, in particular, which we have been a great beneficiary of and continue to be. Part of the catalyst for that is standard markets are not able to get the rates that they need and consequently that is impacting their writings. And that creates opportunity for organizations like the one that I work for.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Equity Research Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Is that also taking into account the drop-in contribution from the inflation linkers?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYeah. So, if you look at it on a prior year basis to the 2024 year, we would expect for the foreseeable future an increase in our net investment income.\n\nMark Hughes - Equity Research Analyst (Truist Securities):\nWhen you say quarter-over-quarter...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

And then, the expense ratio in the reinsurance segment, Rob, I think you talked about some chunky investments and technology, that sort of thing. Would one expect the expense ratio in reinsurance to kind of stay at this level of 29% or so?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. But, obviously, a lot of that has to do with scale. So, as we've touched on, I think, in the past, much of the opportunity has been in the short-tail lines. We'll have to see how those opportunities persist. Further, our colleagues, to their credit and their underwriting discipline, have not found as much opportunity on the liability lines. So, is the 29% sustainable? Yeah, but a lot of that will be in part driven by whether the business is able to grow or remain the size it is, or if market conditions were to deteriorate dramatically, then it's possible that could tick up incrementally.\n\nMark Hughes - Equity Research Analyst (Truist Securities):\nAnd when you think about growth, you pointed out that E&S has become more prominent perhaps. How much of the growth is coming from that mix shift in the E&S when we think about your top-line?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, the E&S business is probably growing at, give or take, 50% more than the standard market rate. That's a bit of a generalization.\n\nMark Hughes - Equity Research Analyst (Truist Securities):\nAnd is that -- 50%, is that a little bit better than say what it was this time last year, or does that [help put steady] (ph)?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I appreciate the question and it's certainly a topic that many of us around here have been scratching our heads over just kind of wondering and daydreaming what will come of it as far as market conditions. But when the day is all done, as far as our book goes, we don't -- is it -- will we have perhaps some level of loss activity? Yes, perhaps. But given what we know today, we don't see this being a material loss to the organization at this stage. When the day is all done, to the extent that some type of business interruption is offered, usually, there's an hours clause, if you like, associated with that, and consequently, given when the patch was available and how quickly people, particularly institutions that have some level of sophistication could get back on their feet, we think it'll prove to be manageable. So, I would be surprised if we didn't have any loss activity, but we certainly do not envision this being something of materiality or great consequence at this stage. That having been said, I think for -- what does it mean for the industry, what does it mean for society, I think we'll have to see over time, but I think for many, perhaps it was a reminder or a wake-up call for the systemic exposure that exists around much of the technology that the world uses to operate.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Equity Research Analyst (TD Cowen):\nI see.

So, the accident year loss ratio ex cat was flat year-over-year, increased a little bit versus the first quarter. I was wondering if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes within that? What was driving it to be up versus the first quarter? And just how we should think about that going forward?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nReally, just to the extent -- I'm just trying to think for a moment, David. Really, the only big moves that -- and they weren't even big, they were just incremental, but we made in a couple of places, would stem from auto, and they can share that we're staying on top of that. But again, when it comes to the overall, it's pretty incremental. And then, we may have in a couple of places taken a look at the umbrella because, again, how that feeds into -- how the auto feeds into the umbrella, we want to make sure that we don't fall behind there.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. That makes sense. And then, I think, the previous question kind of touched on this too, but I noticed in the 10-Q from last quarter, it looks like, you guys had started to make additional reserve increases to just the other liability line for, I think it was accident year 2020 and '21. It sounded like those were primarily auto related. I guess, I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on exactly what was going on? If you're seeing that happen again here in the second quarter? And then maybe just how you're thinking about that and maybe spreading to general liability and umbrella just non-auto related?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThere's no evidence that we see at this time of the issues that we're seeing in umbrella, if you will, spilling over to the other product lines or the issues that we're seeing specifically in auto, I should say, spreading to the other product lines. So that differently, we feel quite comfortable at the moment with the GL. As far as the auto goes, it's a challenging movement. I mean, you drive down I-95 or whatever highway you go down and every other billboard is plaintiff's attorney with their phone number in case a truck cuts you off. And from our perspective, the trend is meaningful, and we need to make sure that we keep up with it. And we want to make sure that the old years are in a reasonable place. And that obviously, as mentioned a few moments ago, has implications, still relatively modest implications, for umbrella. But to your specific question, do we see that sort of some type of viral effect, if you like, spilling over into GL, for example? No, we are not seeing that.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Equity Research Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick one. You had said earlier you guys have gotten 68% cumulative rate since 2019, excluding workers' comp. I'm just wondering, how does the loss trend look versus 2019 if we were just to compare versus that 68% rate increase?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

A submarket under D&O that I would flag as very, very concerning is transactional liability.

Maybe you can give us some examples of kind of what's happened over the last several years in terms of conditions, limits, profiles and that stuff that's going to contribute to the profitability? And I'm assuming that's not factored into that 68% number that you gave us. And maybe how that mitigates any type of development potentially on some of the GL and commercial auto?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYeah. On the GL side, an example would be that you see a contractor move out of the admitted market where they are buying whatever, $1 million limit or [one-to-one] (ph), and they are paying basically, whatever, $50,000 for the $1 million limit. And all of a sudden the standard market because of loss activity or a variety of other reasons, including they can't get the rate that they need, all of a sudden kicks it out. And then as opposed to being $50,000, it's $150,000, but you get $650,000 of cover and maybe you're doing something with defense and you start sub-limiting all kinds of other things and [indiscernible]. So, it really is very much apples and oranges or maybe even apples and bananas because of what you can do with the terms and the conditions. And that's why if you look at our history as an organization, some of our most profitable business has been what we've been able to write on an E&S basis.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):\nAnd actually a quick follow-up then. Do you know approximately how much of your business today is E&S versus, call it, 2019 prior to the cycle hardening up?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have the number in front of me, but as I mentioned to your colleague earlier, pretty consistently our E&S business, even putting aside specialty, but just E&S has been growing at a rate for some number of years, it's 50% more than what our standard market business has been growing at. And just to define standard market, a lot of that is admitted specialty. So, I mean the E&S has really been growing quite quickly and provides good opportunity.\n\nBrian Meredith - Equity Research Analyst (UBS):"

Berkley Corporation is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRob Berkley  - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nKrista, thank you very much. And echoing Krista's comments, welcome to our Q3 call. In addition to me, on this end of the phone, you also have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, and Chief Financial Officer, Rich Baio. We're going to follow a typical pattern, and that is Rich is shortly going to walk you through the highlights. I will then follow up with a few comments and then of course we're very happy to open it up to Q&A and address any questions participants would have. Before I hand it over to Rich, two points that I'd like to make. One, obviously, the third quarter and then more recently, even in the fourth quarter, there's been a significant amount of nat-CAT activity. And oftentimes on these calls or any industry discussions, as we've flagged in the past, people start talking about estimates and models and numbers, and those are all important and real to consider. That having been said, from our perspective, this has impacted countless people's lives, and that is not lost on us. So while we are certainly focused on the numbers and the economics, my colleagues and I are also acutely aware of the challenges that many people in this country are facing as a result of this CAT activity. Further, in addition to extending our concern to all those impacted, I'd like to thank our claims colleagues that are going above and beyond to ensure that we deliver on our promise to all of our policyholders that have been impacted by these events. So again, thinking of those impacted and sending thanks to those that are doing their job and making sure that we deliver on our promise. The second topic I did want to flag, and it really stems from a subject matter that has been getting greater attention more recently, and that is the growth in the specialty space and in particular the E&S market. I don't think it's lost on any of us, the pace of change in the world, how it seems to be accelerating, the level of complexity and risk continues to be on the rise. And certainly there are many contributing factors, but amongst those contributing factors without a doubt, be climate change, as well as social inflation. Both of these items are playing an important role in having a meaningful impact on the insurance industry. And quite frankly, as these two items are impacting loss cost trend, I think much of the standard market or and specifically the admitted market is having a difficult time pivoting. That is creating opportunity for, in particular, the non-admitted market. One of the pinch points that is not discussed as actively in the commercial lines market space as it is in the personalized market space, is the challenges on the regulatory front. There are many insurance departments that are struggling from a staffing perspective, and also we, in addition to that, we see the impact of politics creeping in as well. So as we look at the circumstance and we see this pinch point on the regulatory front, we think that that is likely to continue. That is likely to continue to drive more business into the specialty and in particular the E&S market. And by extension, we think that that is going to bode well for an organization such as ours with a particularly large footprint in the specialty space overall and in particular the E&S marketplace. So with that as a bit of a backdrop, I'm going to pause there and Rich I'll hand it over to you please.\n\nRich Baio  - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. Good evening, everyone. Our record third quarter net income resulted in an increase of almost 10% over the prior year to $366 million, also contributing to a nine-month record net income of approximately $1.2 billion. We continue to generate outstanding returns on equity of 20% in the quarter and more than 21% year-to-date. Both strong underwriting and investment income contributed to our operating earnings of $374 million or $0.93 per share. Despite the above average catastrophic activity experienced by the industry, we've once again been able to demonstrate our careful and prudent underwriting discipline and in particular stability and earnings. Our calendar year combined ratio was 90.9% inclusive of 3.3 loss ratio points from several CAT events and 87.6% on an accident year ex-CAT basis. During the quarter, there were four hurricanes that made landfall, with Helene being the most destructive across several states and continuing SCS activity that contributed modestly to the total amount of CAT losses. Our net premiums written grew above $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter and continues to benefit our record net premiums earned, which increased 10.8% over the prior year. Current accident year underwriting income, excluding CATs, increased 13.4% to $362 million pre-tax, adjusted for CAT losses of $98 million and prior year favorable development of $1 million. Our current accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT, improved quarter-over-quarter by [1.5 points] (ph) to 59.1%, driven by business mix. We continue to invest in the business to drive efficiencies and better experience for our customers combined with new startup operating units that we've announced before. The combination of these items along with the changes in business mix and reinsurance structures have contributed to the increase in our expense ratio by 20 basis points to 28.5%. As previously communicated, we continue to believe that our expense ratio should remain comfortably below 30%. Turning to investments, pre-tax net investment income increased 20% to $324 million. Fixed maturity securities grew by more than $50 million with the Argentine inflation-linked securities normalizing to an amount commensurate with the prior year quarter. We do not anticipate much change on a prospective basis regarding these securities. However, do remind you that when modeling out 2025, you should factor in the elevated non-recurring income in the first and second quarters of 2024. Record operating cash flow in the quarter of $1.25 billion contributes to the record year-to-date cash flow of almost $2.9 billion. Combining the increase in investible assets with a new money rate that's higher than the roll-off book yield on our fixed maturity securities, we remain well-positioned for further investment income growth. The credit quality of the investment portfolio remains at a AA minus, and the duration is 2.4 years for the quarter. Foreign currency losses in the quarter of $25 million related to the US dollar weakening relative to most other currencies. As mentioned in the past, we actively manage our foreign currency exposure and you'll note an improvement in our currency translation adjustment in stockholders' equity, which offsets the amount in the income statement. The effective tax rate remains elevated relative to "

The effective tax rate remains elevated relative to the prior year and has been the case in the first half of the year due to the contribution of foreign earnings taxed at rates greater than the US Statutory rate of 21%. This quarter was 23% and we expect the fourth quarter will likely revert to the high 23% to 24% area that we saw earlier in the year. Stockholders' equity increased above $8 billion for the first time to more than $8.4 billion. Strong earnings of $366 million coupled with an improvement in after-tax unrealized investment losses of $381 million and currency translation gains of $49 million fueled the increase. The company also returned total capital of $138 million, consisting of $95 million of special dividends, $31 million of regular dividends, and $12.5 million of share repurchases at an average price per share of $52.30. Our total capitalization remains strong, and our financial leverage ratio of 25.2%, is at its lowest level in almost two decades. Book value per share before share repurchases and dividends grew 10% in the quarter and 20.1% year-to-date. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob.\n\nRob Berkley  - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thank you. That was great. Let me just offer a couple of quick sound bites. I think Rich did a really thorough job in covering that. But a couple of thoughts from me. One, on the rate, the rate ex comp for the quarter came in at 8.4%. A little additional context, auto liability is leading the way and closely followed by excess and umbrella. As we've been talking about for some number of quarters, perhaps at this stage it can even be measured in years. The loss trend on the auto-line is something that we have been focused on. We feel good about where we are, but assuming this trend continues, we're going to need these additional dollars to make sure that we're well-positioned for claims getting settled tomorrow. Rich obviously covered the loss ratio. I think 62.4% was [three-ish] (ph) points of CATs, not a bad outcome given the frequency of severity for those that are part of the but-for-club. That's the 59.1%. That having been said, we've talked about this and talked about it, and I suspect we'll continue to talk about it. In our opinion, it's all about building book value with an eye towards risk-adjusted return and the concept of backing out cash as if they don't exist. You would have thought that would have run its course by now given every year we seem to have CATs as an industry. So again, from our perspective, when we measure the business, it is a 62.4%. Rich also covered the expense ratio. Just a couple of quick comments from me. One, at this stage, we have a couple of businesses that are not at scale but are in the process to scaling over time. I expect that as they grow, you're going to see the benefit of that increased earned premium and that will [iner] (ph) to the overall benefit of the group's expense ratio. That having been said, we are actively making investments as you would expect on the technology and data front in particular and that's not cheap, but we believe we will get a good return on the investment as well. Obviously, Rich talked about mix of business that can have an impact. I think the last piece that I would flag is the topic of reinsurance. By and large, we are a low-limits player, so our need to buy reinsurance is not the same as many of our peers that are far more dependent on reinsurance. We have absolutely no problem with our reinsurance partners making a profit. In fact, we expect and respect their need to make a reasonable risk-adjusted return. But every now and then, if you find oneself in market conditions where people are looking to take a more aggressive position or even gouge, we have the optionality to change our approach to reinsurance buying and that can impact the expense ratio as well. Lastly, Rich touched a lot on the FX piece and the various ways that it's impacting our P&L, but the punchline for me, as far as FX goes, Rich, you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but it was about $0.05 to us on the per share. Let me turn to investments for a moment and I'm going to take a brief trip-down memory lane, so I apologize in advance for that and thank all for indulging me. I think everyone recalls what was going on during the financial crisis. There was, excuse me, during the financial crisis -- and then again, during COVID, there was massive amounts of economic stimulation rammed into the system. When we saw that occurring, we had a view that there was no way that you were not going to see some level of inflation following that activity. It took a while to come through, but it did come through. And it came through in spades. Ultimately, the government took the action, one would expect and interest rates moved up, particularly on the short-end. We found ourselves with an inferred yield curve and we as an organization were rewarded for the decision to keep our duration short. Our investment income increased dramatically over a relatively short period of time. From our perspective looking forward, it is likely, in our opinion, more likely than not that yes, while inflation may be coming down, we don't think it is going to fall off a cliff. And our expectation is that short-term rates will come down, but they are perhaps not going to come down as quickly or as aggressively as some have suggested. In addition to that regardless of who you expect will be in the White House, there is no doubt if you take them at their word, which is a hard thing to do, but for purposes of conversation, if you take each candidate at their word, they are looking to grow the deficit by what would be measured by the trillions of dollars. So with that as a reality, from our perspective, it is inevitable that the federal government in this country, not dissimilar to other parts of the world, but certainly in this country will be growing its deficit and there is a real question about supply and demand for government debt going forward. So what does this all mean? It means from our perspective, we think you're going to see the yield curve take more and more of a traditional shape. We think that, that is going to create as we've discussed in the past, an opportunity for us to be nudging out our duration and simultaneously our book yields picking up. So speaking more specifically to our numbers today. As Rich mentioned earlier, the duration is sitting at 2.4 years. Our domestic book yield is 4.5%, our new money rate today on that is something north of 5%. We do not believe that we are going to have to give up much on that new money rate rather than what you will see is we will be taking that 2.4 years duration and nudging it out. As a reminder, for us, if you look at the average life of our loss reserves, it is just inside of 4 years. So given that reality, we have a lot of room to take that duration out. And that again, will allow us to maintain or actually improve the book yield from where it is today and quite frankly, maintain that new money rate at levels that I was referring to earlier. So let's get to the punch line, if we will, and then we'll turn the conversation to anywhere participants would like to take it. So what is the story? What is the -- I guess, the punch line? The punchline is this: the business continues to grow, the rate increases that we're getting, we believe is keeping up with trend, actually probably exceeding trend. So all things being equal. Our underwriting margin is likely to continue to improve. In addition to that, when you look at the contribution of the other part of our economic model, that being the investment portfolio, the fact of the matter is our new money rate is and will likely remain above our current book yield. Our cash flow remains exceptionally strong. Hence, the portfolio i"

Just looking to just get some color on the exposure piece or just what went on within the premiums within insurance ex-comp in the quarter?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. I mean, as you can -- I know I appreciate, Elyse, there is a lot of moving pieces, maybe just to call out the big ones. It would really be just referencing my comment earlier around the Auto-lines, in particular, and to a meaningful extent, the Excess and the Umbrella line. But those product lines are really no pun intended being driven by our view on Auto. So we have a view as to what rate adequacy is to my colleague's credit. They have drawn lines in the sand and they've been waiting for the marketplace to catch up to them and to share the view. So that had a meaningful impact on the quarter for what it's worth. And this is like way under the safe harbor comment. When we look at October, there is evidence that would suggest that the world is increasingly coming to the conclusion that we had already come to and is in the process of catching up. So when I look at the growth in the quarter, I would caution you not to assume that that's a new normal given the evidence we are seeing in October. I think it's likely that -- again, the world is quickly catching up to us.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nSo given that comment, Rob, would you expect, I guess you've kind of steered us in the direction of expecting 10% to 15% top line growth based on how you see October, as well as your view for next year or would you expect to be back in the Q4 and then in 2025?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have a perfect crystal ball, but I continue to believe given the breadth of our offering and the -- I believe that we as an organization, on an annual basis, should be able to grow between that 10% and 15%. As I think I've suggested to you and others, there could be a quarter where we exceed that. There could be a quarter where we come in below that. But yes on an annual basis, I continue to believe that we, as an organization, should be running at that level.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

I think looking back a few years ago, you guys might have noted that or implied that it was in sort of the 5% to 6% range. So I was just curious any thoughts or any color you could provide on the loss trend in insurance today? And is financial inflation coming down a reason to maybe loosen the loss trend assumptions in some places at this point?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, Rob, I don't remember exactly what we may have said some number of years ago. I don't even remember what I had for lunch today at this stage. But let me give you a little color as to how we think about it. As I said earlier, ex-comp we got 8.4%. I believe that we are comfortably in excess of trend at that level. Obviously, it varies greatly by product line, but we are very focused on making sure that rate adequacy continues to be the priority for us. So we are not in a position to be able to start giving you what do we use by -- for trend by product line or even give you a blended number at this stage. But I think you hopefully can take comfort as I do that at 8.4%, we are clearing the hurdle by a margin. That having been said, as we've also said in the past, and this I have a pretty clear recollection of, is that we understand and have a respect for the unknown. And while I think there are others perhaps in the marketplace that have a firm view on what loss trend is and to the extent that they are coming in, in excess of that, they will be dropping their pick. And obviously, it is for them to decide how they operate their business. But from our perspective, given the uncertainties of the insurance industry, we are not going to get ahead of ourselves. And one would have thought even what has transpired and how the industry has been impacted by social inflation, people would have learned from that and elected to err on the side of caution. As far as shorter tail lines in your question, clearly, financial inflation was one of the big drivers for short tail lines. We saw and obviously, property and there was a meaningful impact on the auto physical damage line as well. Without a doubt, a lot of the pressure that was stemming from a more inflationary environment has subsided and that is giving a bit of a relief. That having been said, I would suggest to you on the social inflation front, particularly impacting many of the liability lines, I think that -- that is as challenging as ever is probably the right way to characterize it.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nVery helpful and very comprehensive. Thank you, Rob. Maybe just as a follow-up on hurricane - on the hurricanes this quarter and into 4Q. Clearly, some really unfortunate losses there in a number of levels from the recent storms. Do you have a sense of how the market might react from a pricing perspective kind of across admitted E&S and reinsurance? And any impacts outside of the Southeast?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it is a little bit early to reach a conclusion on that. I think we are going to -- at this stage, the outcome of both storms you referenced, and particularly Milton, I don't think that has really come into a very sharp focus, and we are going to just have to see where things settle out. I think the reinsurance marketplace is doing what it can to position itself as I understand it, for flat and my expectation is that unless Milton proves to be uglier, it is going to be a challenge for them to actually achieve flat. As far as the insurance marketplace goes, we'll see how it unfolds, and we are going to have to see what the losses are. I think with Helena, the real challenge there was much of the loss occurred in ZIP codes, where this type of natural catastrophe isn't supposed to happen. So you have a lot of people that's taking a very big step backwards and trying to grapple with. What does this mean for exposure? What does this mean for adequate pricing. So that was a long-winded answer, the short answer is I think it is still in the process of coming into focus.\n\nRob Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):"

So back on the net written premium element. So overall, you came in, I think close to 8% in insurance, a little shy of the 10% to 15%, but as you mentioned earlier, it could bump around Q-to-Q. What -- I'd like to get a sense of is kind of the outlook. Am I understanding it right? So short-term premium was up low double digit. It seems to me since it's in the --.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSorry. When you say short-term premium, are you [referred tail] (ph)?\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nI meant short tail. I'm sorry. So Short-tail lines up low double digit. And my sense there is you're seeing a fair amount of PIF growth where in contrast, other liability, auto, professional liability with those lines being up in the low single digits premium-wise, net written premium, it would strike me that PIF is going backwards. Am I reading that properly? [indiscernible]\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYou are correct. On the Auto-line, our exposure is shrinking at a pretty healthy pace during the quarter for the reasons that I suggested. And our hope is between now in the end of the year, maybe spilling over into early next year, you're going to continue to see more discipline coming in, and we were -- early signs were somewhat encouraging during the month of October. In addition to that, the workers' comp-line, which was pretty much flat. Please understand part of the exposure is not as being payrolls and wage inflation, is playing a role in that as well. So in many cases, our exposure is coming down there as well. So as always, we are looking for where we believe the margin is, and we are leaning into that in places where we have a view that a more defensive posture is appropriate. We are not going to compromise on our underwriting. And sometimes there is a lag for the world to catch up to you. And I think that's what we are seeing in the auto-line. But again, we're encouraged in this month, at least the world seems to be waking up to that reality. As far as the reinsurance front, pivoting over to that segment, the growth that you are seeing in, particularly on the property is just a reflection of market conditions, and we still like the trade there. The flatness that you are seeing on the casualty lines, is really just a reflection of ours. And we've commented for some number of quarters on this, our dissatisfaction with the economics and quite frankly, the [ceding] (ph) commissions, they need to come down and that's what's led to our position there.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nGot it. And just rounding that out Rob, it sounds like you like the short tail lines? That's a PIF grower. And then the other liability and professional are kind of dipping a little bit in-line with auto with the discipline you're showing. Is that fair?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think I would characterize it -- Rich, the other liability was -- I don't have it in front of me, I have it in mostly 9%. Yes. I think that there's just a lot of pieces that are moving around. The E&S in particular is growing quite a bit. On the other hand, some of the things that we talked about as it relates to the admitted casualty, that is more challenging.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nGot it. And then just lastly on prior year developments. Anything of note in the 2020 to 2023 accident years?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich anything that is noteworthy during those years that you wanted to flag?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI would say it is consistent with what we've been communicating previously and what you've said in terms of the commercial auto liability being an area that is a key focus for us.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nKey focus, meaning that you had maybe a bump or an unfavorable or just pretty steady?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have the numbers exactly in front of me, but we had a little bit of noise coming out of the commercial auto liability, nothing particularly overwhelming but certainly evidence of that product line is positioned for a need of change.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

Or do you also kind of includes the way you guys think about it kind of non-US that might not be able to data run or see on paper?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo certainly, a meaningful percentage of what we write non-admitted is through Lloyd's. So Mike, I guess, to your question, you're seeing the US carriers, but I don't think you're picking up the Lloyd's piece would be my guess.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay, got it. That\u2019s what I thought. And just -- I don't know if we don't have -- this has to be a that educational.

Is it on a large account versus a small account or anything notable there?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe vast majority of what we do in Lloyd's is US-centric.

So it's generally speaking, a reflection of our overall philosophy, but they do participate in some shared in Lloyd.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Got it. And I think it was clear, your answers to kind of your view of revenue growth going forward. But just curious Marsh McLennan, for example, will release an index of pricing by line of business and excess casualty/umbrella has accelerated meaningfully quarter-over-quarter to maybe plus 20% levels. Maybe that's more of a large account phenomenon, which you don't play in as much. But I just kind of get -- trying to understand whether you feel like there's more potential to play offense, specifically in social inflationary lines to the extent you do continue to see pricing move north.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe way I would answer that, Mike is we pay attention to different parts of the market. We have a view as to what the margin is and where we think the opportunities are, we are going to lean into it. And where we think, again a more defensive posture is appropriate, we will do so. So do I think that there is meaningful opportunity in the excess and umbrella space to capture the additional rate? Yes, I do. Do I believe my colleagues are executing on that? Yes, I do. But please keep in mind, while we participate with some of the larger accounts, Again the vast majority of what we do is on the smaller end of town. And there is plenty of opportunity there to get more rate, and we are doing it.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nThank you.

How should I think about those two statements?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think -- well, two things. First off, as far as the business mix, we were pleased with the progress that has been made on the property ex-CAT front or the attritional loss ratio. I think that's something we talked about, I don't know \u2013 I probably lose track of time a year, 18 months, two years ago, and my colleagues have done a great job in getting us to a better place and that has coming through in the loss ratio. I think, as far as the rate increase and how that's going to come through, look we have a view on trend, and we have an understanding of how much rate we're getting and the delta between the two in theory should ultimately [enter] (ph) to the benefit of the margin.

Thank you very much. Rich may have said it, where is the new money yield on purchases going on right now for the portfolio?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it was me and got slightly over 5%. I'd use more than 5%, less than 5.25%. Those are the bookends for you.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd is that being purchased at a different duration than that [indiscernible].\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJust to be clear, that's on the domestic. So you would compare that to the 4.5% that we flagged earlier.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nIs the duration -- are you choosing to -- is there a lengthening going on given the changes in the yield curve behavior?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W.

What would we need to see for you to say that longer is better?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think, Josh, we probably don't have a specific answer, but what I can tell you is we're playing close attention to it, watching it every day. And we'll see how the story unfolds, but I don't have a specific road map that I'm in a position to share with you at this time.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd is credit at all a concern -- I mean, it's always a concern, but given outlook for things, are you incrementally more concerned or less concerned about credit compared to where you were a year ago?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think we are always concerned about credit, and that's why as Rich flagged, we are maintaining a very strong AA- on the credit quality of the fixed income portfolio. And you will not see us compromising on quality just to try and fluff up the book yield, if you will. We saw colleagues doing that, quite frankly, during the financial crisis where they -- as well as in during COVID where they compromised on duration and compromise on quality, and that's just not something we're going to do.\n\nJoshua Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAll right.

Rob, I had a question just on the insurance business. So the 60.2% accident year loss ratio ex-CAT improved 50 basis points year-over-year. Sounds like all of that was mix and some of the progress you guys have been making on some of those fire losses from a bit ago. I guess I just wanted to see if there is anything unsustainable in the result as well that might be flattering things from maybe like a light non-cap property perspective or anything else that you would highlight?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo look, obviously we'll know through the passage of time, but the biggest contributor to the improvement that you are referencing was the attritional loss ratio associated with the property. So do I think we just got lucky? My sense is when I look at it, I don't think that's necessarily the case. I think we have many colleagues that are working really hard and have improved the situation. And you are seeing it come through. But again, that's my sense based on what I have seen, we'll see more over time.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, is that something that -- I mean, is that like fully in the numbers now? Or is that something like we should continue to see that improvement going forward specifically on that attritional property book?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nDavid, not trying to be difficult, but they are what they are as we share them with you, and that's us being completely transparent. Could it get better from here? Yes, it could. Could it somehow take a step back? Yes. I mean, I can't guarantee or promise exactly what tomorrow will bring. But based on my look at it. I'm encouraged by the progress that has been made, and I think it is a reflection of the efforts of many of our colleagues.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe I saw this in the 10-Q in the first quarter and the second quarter. It looked like there was some adverse that you guys -- adverse PYD that you guys have taken on the other liability line of business for accident year '21. And I guess I'm just wondering if that continued here in the third quarter and also just how accident year 2022 and 2023 are holding up?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think as opposed to getting into that detail, we'll have a lot of it in the queue and ask that once you have a chance to flip through the queue, if you have any questions, please reach out to us.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nOkay, sounds good.

I guess just the first question, thinking about the 10% to 15% growth and trying to figure out if I'm thinking about this right. So is it what you're really saying is you think that Berkley is a 10% to 15% grower but you flagged some risk reduction or remediation or what have you commercial auto over the next few quarters? And perhaps while you are doing that, it might be more of a challenge to do 10% to 15%. I'm just trying to understand, am I thinking about that, right, that the 10% to 15% is sort of a longer-term view?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLet me at least try to answer your question. I think what we have suggested and are trying to suggest today on an annual basis, we believe the business can grow at 10% to 15%. In addition, as we suggested in the past, there could be a quarter where we grow more, there could be a quarter that we'd grow less. Ultimately for us, while we certainly would like to grow, underwriting margin is king, queen whatever label you'd like to use. When we look out at the marketplace during the quarter, we took some action as it relates to auto, in particular, and quite frankly, a few other lines related to auto. As a result of that, that slowed the growth. One of the things that at least I was trying to suggest earlier is it would seem as though. The issues that we have identified parts of the market are starting to more actively grapple with those in October, and that would provide some encouragement that you will see what I would view as a one-off quarter headwind, maybe subsiding somewhat. So as I suggested earlier, long story short Ryan, I am not of the view that we are changing the position that the business should be on an annual basis able to grow 10% to 15%. I was merely trying to unpack the quarter a little bit and help you understand what that speed bump is which I believe is becoming less and less of an issue based on what we saw in October.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Then just a follow-up, just a couple of quick ones on CATs. First of all, I'd be curious what your loss was from Helene? And then second of all, I know you don't want to give a number for Milton. But if I look back to the Ian quarter a couple of years ago, it was about $100 million of CATs. Can you say directionally like could it be that big again given the growth or probably from a [donor] (ph) standpoint, this is [indiscernible]. For Milton. Correct. So, for, for Helena or Milton, what was those?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nFor Helena, I think you should assume about half of it, give or take, was Helena related. Then there were some other CAT activity, as Rich referenced, though Helena obviously got all the attention. There were some other losses going on. Switching over to Milton, I think it is premature for us or for that to really give you a specific number. But as I think whatever the outcome would be, it will be sitting within what you would expect from this organization as far as the size of the loss. And as you've heard from Rich, you've heard from my boss, you've heard from me, we pay very close attention to the topic of volatility, whether it be on the underwriting side or the investment side. So that's probably about as much color as I can give you on Milton, but I don't think that there is something that's going to come out of that, that's going to make anyone pause severely.\n\nRyan Tunis - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

You guys have been growing a little bit less as you're doing some work on some different lines. And externally, it's always hard to sort of judge how much dry powder a company may have in capacity to sort of lean into opportunities as they rise, you have. And so I would just be interested to know -- how do you think about that? And then maybe if you could just refresh us on sort of pecking order at this point with pricing getting better and some good signs but not putting it into growth as much right now. How do you approach share buybacks and special dividends and so forth?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo from our perspective, the company has a comfortable surplus of capital plus. And again, anyone who has a real curiosity can go through the painstaking experience of perhaps taking the S&P model and taking our data and running it through. And you will get a large surplus or excess of capital, which is there to allow us to be opportunistic. Arguably, we have more capital than even one would need to maintain that position. And as we see opportunities, we will be returning that to those that belongs to specifically our shareholders. So long story short, we have an excess of capital in the company at this stage is generating capital more quickly than we can utilize it. So it's a reasonable assumption that we will continue to opportunistically look for ways to return the capital to shareholders while still maintaining a comfortable balance plus.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. That\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about reserves. I mean, it's no secret that some external folks struggle with looking at the disclosures on more recent accident years and myself included in that. And it's hard from the outside. So I wanted to ask you, like what are the some of the nuances to it? What are some of the things that when you all look at the more recent accident years? And maybe it is an update on the paid loss ratios you're seeing, I don't know. But what are some of the things that give you more confidence than I've had?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell again, I'm not sure I fully understand all the reservations you or others have, but I\u2019d suggest that it's really a couple of things. We've talked about the paid loss ratio in the past, and we're happy to pick up that conversation anytime anyone wishes to. In addition to that, we've talked about the strength of our IBNR compared to total reserves, as well as the strength of our IBNR relative to case, and you can see that trend. And then in addition to that, I think on the last call or two, we talked about our initial IBNR relative to our earned premium, Rich, which we brought back to people's attention because I think, there were some question with the other metrics we were putting forth. Well, how is that impacted by the fact that the business is growing? So that's why we try to draw people's attention to the initial IBNR relative to earned, which should take into account growth. In addition to that, I think that there are a lot of folks that before they reach conclusions, they need to unpack our mix of business with greater granularity. And there are some people that have offered a view on the more recent years and how we've thought about those reserves without having a full appreciation for in some cases where we're using a claims made form as opposed to an incurrence form or amongst other mixes of business. So we look at our loss reserves, very regularly, every quarter, we look at it at a very granular level by operating business, by product line, and we look at the aggregate and we look at it in between the two. And from our perspective, ultimately we respect the fact that everyone is entitled to their opinion. At the same time, we are doing the best we can to try and help people understand but there is also a reality and it is going to be hard for us to prove it other than through the passage of time. I think the last point that I would raise, as it relates to the topic of reserves. I think the world oftentimes paints with a very broad brush. And when they see other market participants having to grapple with some challenging circumstances, they look at the product line particularly when it is casualty or liability exposure. And then they'll extrapolate and they'll say, well, this company over here had problems with this product line, so let's go out and look at who else would potentially have that exposure, and then they'll make this leap that, that is going to be an issue for everyone. And I think that, that can be a very slippery slope and would encourage people to invest the additional time and perhaps use a finer brush and recognizing that there is a greater distinction than perhaps I appreciate at base value.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

And hopefully, over time, you're going to see that make its way back towards $20 million a quarter. But in the short run, I would encourage you to pencil in $10 million.

Berkley Corporation):\nI would just like to add one comment that went along with the investment income question and that is our goal is to take advantage of the changing shape of the yield curve and move the duration of our portfolio out. On the other hand, if you look at the level of leverage in the world, there is not a rush to do that. At the same time, we\u2019ve no interest at all, as Rob said of lowering the quality, if anything, the kinds of things we bought in the past quarter have been probably average of AA, not AA-. It's an opportunistic strategy that's geared to the view that we don't think rates are going to go down a lot, especially on the longer side. And therefore, we can continue to invest. And it's not only reinvesting the money, but we're going to probably have $4 billion of cash flow. That's a lot of money to invest. So we are quite optimistic about our investment income, let alone our operating profit margins from underwriting. So we continue to see quality and duration improving as the yield concurrently going up.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. Krista, thank you very much, and thank you to our participants. As suggested earlier, we think the business is well positioned, and we look forward to catching up with you in about 90 days. Thank you. Have a good evening."

Berkley Corporation):\nLisa, thank you very much, and good afternoon all. And let me echo Lisa's welcome to our fourth quarter call. So, as in the past, we have Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman, joining on this end along with Rich Baio, Chief Financial Officer. And we're going to follow our typical agenda where shortly I'm going to hand it over to Rich. He's going to walk us through some highlights. I'm going to then follow-up with a few quick comments on my end. And then, we'll be very happy to take the conversation in any direction that participants wish to take in. Before I do hand it over to Rich, just a very quick comment really not just on behalf of myself but on behalf of all of my colleagues expressing our concern for all who have been impacted not just by the recent events in California and these horrific fires, but also we shouldn't forget about the many people that were terribly impacted during the 2024 year as a result of hurricanes and other events. From our perspective, it is certainly a moment for the industry to demonstrate its value to society. I know that my colleagues and I are very focused on ensuring that we, as an organization, do what we are supposed to do to live up to our responsibilities and certainly our hope that our peers at other organizations will be doing the same. So with that, I will hand it over to Rich. Rich, if you want to run us through the highlights and then we'll take it from there.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. Good evening, everyone. The 2024 full year closed out with record top-line and bottom-line results, yielding return on equity of 23.6% and operating return on equity of 22.4%. The fourth quarter record operating earnings increased 15.5% to $453 million or $1.13 per share, with an operating return on equity of 24.3%. Net income represented our second best quarter, increasing 45% to $576 million or $1.44 per share, with return on equity of 30.9%. The key drivers behind the quarter were strong underwriting results, combined with the continuation of growth in our core investment portfolio. Starting with underwriting performance. Our current accident year combined ratio before cat losses of 2.6 loss ratio points was 87.7%, consistent with the full year 2024. The calendar year combined ratio was 90.2%, resulting in $294 million of underwriting income, bringing the full year 2024 to 90.3% and a record underwriting income of more than $1.1 billion. The prior year development was favorable by $1.6 million in the quarter. Drilling down further into the component parts, the current accident year loss ratio ex cats was 59.2%, which ticked up slightly from the prior year due to business mix and remains flat to the full years 2024 and 2023. Cat losses increased over the prior year, primarily due to Hurricane Milton, driving the increase quarter-over-quarter of 1.4 loss ratio points. The expense ratio of 28.4% was flat to the prior-year quarter, continuing to benefit from record net premiums earned of more than $3 billion and initiatives driving technological and operational efficiencies throughout the business. We believe 2025 will reflect an expense ratio comfortably below 30%. The full year 2024 marked another record year on top-line. The gross and net premiums written grew 9.6% and 9.3%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the Insurance segment's net premiums written increased 9.9% to more than $2.6 billion, with growth in all lines of business. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew in property and monoline excess with a decrease in casualty due to the competitive pricing environment. Moving on to investments. The core portfolio increased 9.4% to $313 million. We do expect the core portfolio to continue to grow over the fourth quarter 2024 in the foreseeable future due to higher new money rates compared with the roll-off book yield and growth in the size of the investment portfolio. Our record operating cash flow from 2024 of almost $3.7 billion followed the year before's operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, which was also a record, and has enabled us to invest more while maintaining the high credit quality of AA minus. In addition, we've increased our investment duration from 2.4 years to 2.6 years in the quarter. And at the end of 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of almost $2 billion. Net investment gains were primarily driven by favorable market value movements in common and preferred equity securities. Investments in the energy and certain financial services sectors led to the $163 million unrealized gain. Effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter benefited from the utilization of some foreign valuation allowances established against operating loss carry-forwards and true-up adjustments for prior periods. This brings our full year effective tax rate to 22.5% and we expect 2025 will be 23%, plus or minus. As it relates to capital, the stockholders' equity increased 12.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily due to record net income of $1.8 billion, partially offset by the return of capital to shareholders of $836 million through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we paid regular and special dividends of $220 million and repurchased $67 million in shares. Our after-tax unrealized investment loss is $517 million as of year-end 2024, an improvement of $69 million from the prior year. And finally, book value per share before repurchases and dividends grew 23.5% for the full year. Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. Rich, thank you very much. Very clear, and sure appreciated by all. So, before I offer a few thoughts on the marketplace and then on our quarter, just highlighting the obvious at this stage as you've likely had an opportunity to flip through the release and would have heard Rich's comments. 2024 was truly another exceptional year for the organization. And I did -- before we get into the nooks and crannies that we typically do on these calls, I did want to take a moment just to pause and both thank and congratulate our roughly 7,300 colleagues for yet again a job very well done. The three of us have the privilege of speaking on behalf of the full team, but as a reminder to all, this is a team sport and the outcome is a reflection of the team, not just the folks that happen to be speaking to you on this call today. So again, to the team, thank you and truly congratulations on yet another great performance.

      "raw_bytes": " the marketplace, as far as much of the liability market, it continues to be plagued by social inflation. The combination of an emboldened plaintiff bar along with quite frankly, this jet fuel that they have in their back pocket, otherwise known as litigation funding, continues just to up the game. That having been said, social inflation does not apply to all product lines equally. So, maybe to give an example or to be more specific, while it is certainly prevalent in most places within the liability space, if you look at certain lines of business where claims are more exposed or is more commonplace where there is actually physical injury to someone, you will see a reaction coming out of a jury that tends to be far more inflated. By example, the type of awards that are coming out related to auto liability or med mal and the inflation that we are seeing in those types of claims is far more than what we would be seeing in the D&O space or what we would be seeing in the accountants' liability space, just to pick a few to try and articulate the point. One of the things that's been both surprising and, quite frankly, a bit disappointing to me has been how slow or sluggish the reinsurance market has been to respond to social inflation and some of the challenges. It is our suspicion that you are seeing a gradual groundswell that is building and we will see discipline coming to the casualty reinsurance market, hopefully over the coming months and years, and that will create an opportunity for our colleagues in the reinsurance space. But in the meantime, when there is that lack of discipline, we very much applaud our colleagues for the discipline that they are exercising. Pivoting over to the short tail line, specifically property, certainly for the moment and we'll have to see what the impact of the California fires is, but for the moment, property insurance, there is still a tailwind, but it is slowing. And if you pivot over to the property reinsurance market and even more so the retro market, it is clear that at 1/1, there was no tailwind to be found. In fact, it was quite to the contrary, there was a growing headwind. By example, our property cat renewal risk-adjusted was down 15%-ish and a similar percentage for our retro. Moving on to our quarter, I don't have a lot to add and I guess at the risk of being a little bit repetitive following Rich, the net written premium was 8%, but going back to a comment earlier and what Rich had unpacked for us a little bit, I think you need to look at that a little more carefully. And the fact of the matter is if you back out the casualty reinsurance where we find market conditions to be concerning and we believe that more of a defensive posture is appropriate, if you back that out, we're at 10%. Rate ex workers' comp came in at 7.7%. Renewal retention ratio a little bit above 80, which continues to be very consistent with what it's been for at this stage, I don't know how many quarters or, for that matter, how many years. On the expense front, the 28.4%, Rich talked about continuing to be sub-30% for the foreseeable. Richie, this is a little bit of a heads up. I'm going to ask you to talk about expenses for a moment. But if you go back and you look at the journey that we've been on, we've been able to hold the line on expenses through investment in technology along with the utilization of BPO. And if you think about where our expense ratio was pre-COVID and where we are today, even with the COVID benefit on expenses having gone away, we continue to be in a very good place. So, I'm going to keep going in a minute, but I'm going to take a pause, catch my breath. And Richie, if you want to speak to expenses for a moment, please?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure. So, as Rob alluded to, certainly post-COVID, we've benefited where our expense ratio has been in the low 20%s to mid-20% -- low 28% to 28.5% area. But proceeding that, going back to 2020 and prior, certainly began with a three handle. And if we go back to the decade ago, basically at 33%-and-change. So, certainly have seen close to a 5-point improvement in the expense ratio over that period of time.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAnd I would just add to that, one needs to keep in mind our mix of business and a meaningful amount of the business we write has an acquisition cost that is greater due to the fact that we do a fair amount of business in the wholesale market. So, Rich covered the combined ratio. Again, a 90.2%, given the cat activity in the quarter, not a bad place to come out. Speaking of that, on the topic of cats, obviously, it's very early to be speculating around California and what it will mean, but I would just remind folks that we are California light when it comes to property. Obviously, one of the areas that has gotten a lot of attention is the personal line space and our efforts, known as Berkley One within the private client personal line space, we do not participate in the California market. So hopefully that is helpful. And I think the punch line is, while I'm sure we will have some loss activity associated with the fires, I expect that it will not keep us from still delivering a respectable return to our shareholders in Q1 based on everything I can see today. Switching over to the investments, again, Rich covered this. The AA minus continues to get stronger with every passing day and we're feeling very good about that. Simultaneously, you would note as Rich flagged the duration. We've talked about this for some number of quarters. When we see the opportunity, we're going to nudge that duration out. We saw an opportunity, so it popped out from 2.4-and-change out to 2.6-and-change. And again, we feel no pressure, but when we see the window of opportunity, our colleagues are not going to let that pass by without taking advantage of it. I think another data point that really plays into the whole economic model and I think as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters, when we were going through an extended period of time and interest rates were reduced or depressed, if you will, I think a lot of folks forgot about the component of our economic model that being the investment portfolio and investment income. Obviously, that has been reawoken. Everyone can see that, but that story is not fully told at this stage. So, a couple of data points for you. Our domestic book yield for the quarter was approximately 4.6%. Our new money rate today is 5.25%-plus. So, as you can see, that increase along with the cash flow that Rich talked about for the year of $3.7 billion or $810 million in the quarter, we have a growing portfolio where new money rate is considerably above the book yield, and I think we all know what that means. So, long story short, what's the punch line? It's the following: 2025 is a year that we think the table is already set and it's set in a very attractive way. And with every passing day, we're setting the table more and more for 2026. The reality is that our underwriting margin is likely to improve from here over time and certainly at a minimum will not be deteriorating. In addition to that, as far as the investment portfolio, the other key component of our economic model, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the investable assets continue to grow at a healthy pace, and that new money rate given our view on where quite frankly government borrowing is going to need to be, where inflation is going to be, there will continue to be an opportunity for us to put money to work at a healthy spread above the current book yield. As it is today, we do not see that disappearing overnight. So, obviously, people will digest and process the data any way they like, but the numbers and the information that we shared with you all today, those are statements of fact and, quite frankly, you don't need to be particularly insightfu"

Berkley Corporation):\nHi, Alex. Good afternoon.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGood afternoon. First one I have for you all is just, how we should think through balancing growth? It sounded like you're not willing to budge on the margins you're seeing and potential improvement even. Just given the landscape, particularly for reinsurance, but even in insurance with what's going on with property, do you think we're going to go through a period where we have to potentially be lower than where you all would like to be on growth over the medium to long term? And how does that get balanced out with potential capital return and just how we should think about where you'd run your leverage through a period like that?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, a, thank you for the question, and b, my thoughts on it are as follows. We as an organization are unapologetic in the fact that we're in business to make good risk-adjusted returns. We will write the business and lean into it when we think the margin is there and we will have no qualms taking a more defensive posture when we don't think the margin is there. I think we have demonstrated that time and time again and you can see that actually we lay the numbers out for you on Slide 7 or Page 7, if you will, of our press release, and you can see our casualty reinsurance in the quarter was down more than 15%. That's because of the comments not only that I shared earlier today, but we have talked about in past quarters and earlier where we just don't think that the market is exercising the discipline and quite frankly is expecting an appropriate risk-adjusted return. So, we will participate where we think it makes sense and not. So, when you put that all together, Alex, we can only control what we can control. We can't control the market. We can control our behavior. We are seeing opportunities in much of the market today. We think we have great colleagues with great expertise. They understand how to separate the wheat from the chaff, and I think we're in a pretty good place. Again, if you look at some of the growth in the insurance front and you can see the opportunity that while slowing still exists even on the property reinsurance front, we're going to try and take advantage of that. But when the day is all done, we think that there is still a lot of opportunity out there and we're looking to capitalize on it. And our comment around opportunity to grow, nobody knows for sure until you're there, but at this stage, the fact is we have a lot of -- we have businesses that when you put it all together are growing at high-single-digit or more, and there are parts of our business, quite frankly, that are growing at a much higher rate. So, again, hopefully, that was a lot of babble on my part, but if you look at Slide 7, I think -- or Page 7 of the release, it demonstrates we grow where the margin is. And so, what does that mean? We think the business should be able to continue to grow at a healthy rate in excess of trend.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nGot it. That's all very helpful. Maybe focusing a little more on the primary side, I guess, we heard from one of the other smaller specialty companies that property, they were seeing a lot of competition. I think they flagged MGAs. I think others have flagged the Lloyd's market. How is price adequacy in property within the insurance business? And is that still a place that you can grow your targeted profitability?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWe think that there is still an opportunity, generally speaking, in property. That having been said, it's reasonably evident that there is a bit more competition today than there was yesterday in certain pockets. We'll have to see what the impact is of the California fires, whether that changes the appetite of some. But yes, as I tried to articulate earlier, I think for property insurance, there is still a tailwind, but it is clearly diminished from what it was yesterday. But it has not become a headwind or eroding to the extent that the reinsurance market has on the property front.\n\nAlex Scott - Analyst (Barclays):"

I was hoping you could give that to us tonight and then just provide any color you might have seen within insurance or reinsurance that stands out with short or long tail reserves in the quarter.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

Karen, if you wouldn't mind just circling up after the call because we wouldn't want to give you anything but the accurate information. As far as where are the challenges, I think as we've talked about in past calls, we're paying close attention to auto liability and we're paying close attention to access, particularly -- and umbrella and particularly how auto liability feeds into that. Going the other way, workers' compensation continues to be a good guy, and we have some other lines where it continues to be very encouraging as well. I think the actions that we have taken regarding auto, both in the primary and how it applies to the excess, are well entrenched at this stage. So, I would never go so far as to declare victory prematurely, but I think we're on the right path.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And it sounds like from your comments, right, you guys are pretty cautious, right, on the casualty reinsurance market. So, as you think about how that market, I guess, could play out in '25 as well as, right, other markets, be that other long or short tail lines, do you think you'd get back Rob to 10% to 15%? I know, right, it's less top-line to grow. You don't want to grow in areas, right, that aren't offering good opportunities. How do you see growth from a top-line perspective playing out in 2025?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, this is the part where I guess you see if I take the bait or not. And I guess the answer is this. I don't know with any greater certainty than anyone else what 2025 is going to hold for us. I believe that there should be an opportunity for this organization for the 2025 year to grow in double digits. Is it possible that that could prove to be 9%? Yes, it is. Is it possible that that could prove to be 16%? Yes, it is. But do I think that we should be able to grow our exposure in something in excess of the rate that we are achieving? Yes, I do. And given that we are getting more than 7 points of rate, I think that that should help us get to what I'm pointing you in the direction of.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then, one last one. Was there anything -- it looks like the insurance underlying loss ratio maybe ticked up a little bit in the quarter from where it had been running. Was there anything one-off...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYeah, maybe about 0.5 point or so. And I would caution you not to read too deeply into it because Rich and I did spend some time on this and it really just boiled down to mix of business.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

And if I remember correctly, Rob, you had expressed a fair amount of optimism around pricing in the insurance casualty line in October, and you felt pretty good that it might see some pickup. Could you kind of elaborate on where that is now in January?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, I've not seen our January price monitor, so I'm a little bit on my heels. That having been said, based on the anecdotal information that I have heard from colleagues, I think that the momentum continues to be very strong around rate achieved on much of the liability and other liability included in that.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nOkay. So, it's strong. So, Rob, what's the disconnect between your concerns about the reinsurance casualty pricing? How do you reconcile the reinsurance pricing coming off? And I think you said down 15%...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nOur premium -- just to be clear, sorry, our premium was down about just shy of 15.5% for our casualty reinsurance in the quarter.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nFor casualty, and yet you seem to like it on the primary level. Could you maybe reconcile the two and why you're far less favorably disposed on reinsurance casualty?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R.

And going back in time, that hasn't always been the case across the board, but some of our best risk-adjusted returns are coming from -- are being generated by our colleagues outside of the United States.

The submission flow coming into the E&S marketplace continues to be robust. We'll have to see again what the impact of the California fires is, but we're probably seeing a little less momentum on the property side and more momentum on the casualty side as far as the submission flow regarding E&S. I would tell you there are pockets of professional that have become a little bit more competitive on the E&S front. But that having been said, overall our E&S business is growing considerably faster than our admitted business today.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist Securities):\nAnd then, you expressed a lot of confidence that the underwriting profitability wouldn't be deteriorating or would be likely improving and definitely not a deteriorating. Pricing is still up nicely. What should we think about the inflation and loss costs? Are you seeing a step down in loss inflation? I know you've talked about the social inflation in those drivers, but seems like you have a little more optimism about the spread on a go-forward basis.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think we've been getting a lot of rate for a long time at this stage. In addition to that, I think we have grown visibility and confidence in the underwriting actions that have already been taken and continue to be applied. And when you put all of that together, I think we are cautiously optimistic as to what that likely bodes for the results over time. I think the reality is when we look at our mix of business and we look at the rate that we have achieved and that we continue to achieve and if you look at the aggregate, 7.7% or so, and we look at how we think about trend at a pretty granular level, we think we're in a good place. So, again, none of us know for sure, particularly with some of the longer tail lines other than through the passage of time, but there's some encouraging data that we're seeing.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist Securities):"

Good evening.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nHey, good evening. First question. Coming back to -- I'm going to assume, we don't know the -- you don't have the answer to the reserve changes this quarter, but based on kind of the year-to-date nine months, it looks like workers' comp was definitely a big good guy in terms of reserve releases. So, I'm just trying to kind of curious one of the tougher questions we get is you know, why is Rob bearish on kind of workers' comp if profits are so good and still continues to release a lot of reserves. So, just kind of curious if your views on comp are improving potentially or just kind of talking through the dynamics there.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that when it comes to workers' compensation, I miss assessed frequency trend and how remarkably negative it has remained for an extended period of time. In addition to that, I probably did not give enough credit to wage inflation and what that has meant for pricing and, by extension, margin. On the other hand, I continue to be concerned about medical cost and medical trend, and it is hard for me to imagine that the workers' comp market will be insulated from that reality indefinitely. So, at this stage, as you would have noticed in the quarter, we grew a little bit in comp even though our rate was ever so modestly negative, but we are finding opportunities to grow in comp, but it tends to be very specialized. We are not growing what I would describe as a main street comp. We are growing in specialized comp as far as the exposure goes.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. Okay. I appreciate the candidness there. Switching gears, if we reflect on the past year or whatever amount of time you would like to reflect on, is it fair to assume that given you're growing faster in E&S than in commercial that that's having kind of a positive impact on the overall company's combined ratio, or is that not a fair assessment?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I hope every place we're growing is going to have a positive impact on the combined ratio. I understand your point is E&S higher margin, and in some cases that is the case, but that's not always the case. But maybe specifically to your point, I think that our loss ratios are in a very good place. Do I think it's possible through the passage of time that they will improve? Yes, I do believe that that is a possibility. Are we going to sort of get ahead of ourselves? No, we are not. Mike, I don't know if we had the conversation, but certainly Rich and I have chatted with others about it. It was -- that 16 through 19 year and that stark reminder of the mismatch between when you write your business and when you'd really know your cost of goods sold, that was a very sobering experience for us. And as a result of that, we're just not going to get ahead of ourselves. Quite frankly, at this stage, the business is generating without any strain 20%-plus returns. So, there's really no incentive in my opinion to do anything other than make sure we are thoughtful and measured and continue to have a healthy respect for that reality of not knowing your cost of goods sold until some number of years after we made the sale. So, yeah, when I -- when we look back on it in the future, I think things are going to look possibly better than they do today, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. And just lastly, sticking on the E&S marketplace, loud and clear about growth -- your growth outlook kind of direction remains the same as last quarter. But specifically in the E&S marketplace, given how, I guess, good returns are for most companies, because we're hearing some companies talk about some pricing deceleration in the E&S casualty marketplace. Are you seeing that at all? Thanks.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't see that in the E&S casualty space. I can imagine that potentially happening in the property space, let's -- putting aside whatever the California impact is, but I don't see that happening in the casualty space. And quite frankly, I think if anything, that pricing environment is more likely than not to remain quite resilient when it comes to casualty. We'll have to see professional perhaps as a different animal, but if we're talking about E&S casualty, then I think that that is quite strong and there's nothing that leads me to believe that you're going to see that momentum erode. Again, property a little bit different. And if you unpack a lot of the growth that the E&S market has seen over the past several years, it is weighted towards property. So, as I think we've all talked about, property tends to respond quickly and very severely, but it tends to be shorter lived as opposed to casualty tends to be slower, but oftentimes has more staying power as far as market conditions.\n\nMike Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nThank you, Rob.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

My first question is on the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess loss ratio. I mean, it was an exceptional result this quarter on an underlying basis. I know for the Insurance segment, you guys caution not to read too much into the uptick in the underwriting ratio there. Perhaps you can offer us some color on the result in the reinsurance segment and really what you're thinking on the margins there as you look into 2025?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, maybe going back to a couple of the comments earlier, obviously, we have reservations around some of the casualty lines and for that matter some of the professional within the reinsurance market, excuse me. In addition to that, on the other hand, we have the property market, we believe, is clearly under pressure. You could see that clear as day at 1/1, but we think that there continues to be margin in the business and for the moment, it's adequately priced. So, we are going to continue to ride that property horse as long as we can until we reach a conclusion that it no longer makes sense, and then you will see us go from an offensive posture to a defensive posture. As far as the casualty goes, I think we already covered that. That action on the reinsurance front was, again, demonstrated by us shrinking the book by more than 15% in the quarter. And again, I think that it's just a reflection of our view that we're capital managers. We're in business to make money. If we don't think it's a good risk-adjusted return, we're happy to let it go.\n\nKatie Sakys - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Okay. And then, circling back to your commentary, Rob, on the workers' comp growth this quarter, you've mentioned there were particular niches of workers' comp where you guys were seeing some opportunities for growth. Are those pockets of growth sustainable? And can we expect to continue to see some modest growth out of that line over the next couple of quarters, or are these niches that kind of pop up and come and go?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo obviously, again, nobody knows for sure what tomorrow will bring, but the couple of monoline businesses that participate in the specialty comp space, the momentum that they're enjoying today, we do not see that going away tomorrow. So, certainly, we think there will likely continue to be some opportunity throughout '25.\n\nKatie Sakys - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nOkay. And then, if I may sneak in one more? Do you guys have any updates on your 2025 reinsurance program and how your catastrophe loss budget for this year might compare to 2024?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI would suggest -- I don't have it at my fingertips. I don't think Rich does, but you certainly if you give Karen a call, she can get into it in some detail or at least as much detail as we're allowed to. But I would remind you of the comment that we shared earlier around our property cat reinsurance risk-adjusted was down 15%-ish or so, and a similar reduction in risk-adjusted rate on the retro.\n\nKatie Sakys - Analyst (Autonomous Research):"

Good evening.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGood evening. So, quick question on -- like I'm curious your view on social inflation really. So, it does feel like plaintiff bar is more active in the Northeast and West Coast, in fact, something that California's Commissioner also touched on when it comes to L.A. Wildfire. Are there any particular geography in the US where you feel it could be represented like a higher risk area for social inflation? Like, is there a way to think about the Northeast, West Coast, Midwest, curious your way to think about it, is it shifting away from Florida and Georgia?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, I mean, I would tell you that there are certain territories or states or really counties that are part of the country that are obviously more challenging than others. I think the difficulty is not the states that have historically been very challenging, but it's the ones that are changing very quickly. And from a legal environment perspective, we have some states that are very red and have always been red. We have some states that perhaps are more blue and they've always been blue. And now what's becoming more challenging is some states that were one color changing to a different color or some states, for example, that were perhaps once red and now they're more purple. I would tell you an example of a state that has shifted dramatically would be one that you just mentioned, the state of Georgia, where once upon a time, that was an easier place to do business, but it has become ever more aggressive as far as the plaintiff bar goes. Another state that once upon a time was defendant-friendly or more defendant-friendly would be Texas. And there are counties in Texas that I'm not quite sure they've become Cook County, but they are definitely trending in that direction. So, I think you raised a really important point. It's one that we internally spend a lot of time thinking about because this rate alone is a very blunt instrument and -- so are terms and conditions. My colleagues, to their credit, are obviously using the rate tool and the term and condition tool, but they are also, at a very granular level, down to county thinking about exposure based on legal environment. I think that has become and will become increasingly more and more something that this industry is going to have to grapple with.\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nGot it. Okay. I guess my follow-up is just so that like I'm clear, then in that case, is it fair to say that some of the commercial casualty lines could potentially behave more similar to personal line in the sense where geography and region is more important than the business mix? Like, is that a fair statement down the road? Just curious as to if that is the direction of...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, I assume that you're leaning in the direction of [nat cat] (ph), if you will, and what that means for exposure. You're extrapolating from that as far as legal environment by territory and what that means for exposure?\n\nBob Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):"

Berkley Corporation):\nDavid, good evening.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nSo, Rob, you spoke a little bit about some of the competitiveness in the casualty reinsurance market, and commend you guys for stepping back a little bit from that market. I guess, has that made you reevaluate at all your outward program? One of your peers purchased a little bit more coverage. Has that entered your thought process at all here as we -- or did that enter your thought process at all at the 1/1 renewal?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, we're conscious of cost of capital, both the capital that we effectively own and the capital that we effectively rent, i.e., reinsurance. We also are conscious of the fact that there are some reinsurance relationships that are true partnerships, and there are other reinsurance relationships that are truly transactional. Those that are partnerships are ones that tend to endure time. From our perspective, our colleagues are very skilled in understanding where the marketplace is, and I think are attentive to making sure that we are doing what is in the best interest of our shareholders and simultaneously treating those that are truly our partners with the care and respect that they deserve. So, when the day is all done, we're conscious of where the market is and we're going to do what we think makes sense for this organization, its shareholders, and our long-term partners.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then, it was good to see the commercial auto growth tick up a little bit as well as the other liability growth in the quarter. I guess, are rates in those lines, are they at levels that are, I guess, good enough for you guys to continue to lean in as we head into 2025?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nObviously, we were satisfied with the available rate. Otherwise, we wouldn't have written the business, i.e., as you saw what we did in the reinsurance space. Today, given the rates that we were able to achieve, we're happy with it. I don't know what the rating environment will be for the balance of the year, but from my perspective, the loss activity that the marketplace is facing and some of our competitors have finally come into grips with reality is creating an opportunity for those of us that have been already grappling with that reality to move forward more quickly.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. That's helpful. And then, I know you guys didn't give the reserve development by segment. So, I'll follow-up with Karen. I guess, I'm just wondering...\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt's like the one piece of paper I left in my office and it's a long haul and I got short legs. So, give Karen a call.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYeah, we'll do. I guess, there's obviously a lot more focus on the more recent accident years. I'm sure you guys are also laser-focused on that as well and we can see it in the pics. Any sort of incremental color that you can provide on that would be helpful.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI mean, nothing really beyond what we talked about. I think we continue to be very -- as we've mentioned even earlier in this call, we're very focused on auto liability. We're very focused on other product lines where there's the potential for injury to individual that seems to turbocharge social inflation. So, I think one needs to do it. Is social inflation impacting most liability lines or cash? Yes, the answer is, but it does not apply equally to all product lines. We are concerned about med mal. We are concerned about auto liability. We're even concerned about other types of coverage where you could have an individual or a group of people physically hurt. That seems to be where a jury will take someone to the woodshed. And we are doing what we need to do on that front as covered earlier from a rate perspective, from a selection perspective, from a terms and conditions perspective. And part of selection as discussed with our colleague a few moments ago is territory, jurisdiction, whatever, county.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nYeah, understood. Thanks for that color. I appreciate it.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):"

So, we spent some time talking about, like, these examples where bodily injury to individuals is exacerbating social inflation. How -- is the loss trend in those situations, is that getting worse, or is it just something that you're talking about now that you've been seeing internally for longer?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that it is just very apparent that that trend is a bit steeper, and that's not something new. It just has been, and I couldn't figure out what the heck to talk about today. So, I figured I should talk -- mention that.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nFair enough. Okay. When you talk about, I guess, the various court jurisdictions, so the one that stands out as a concern is older ones getting -- I'm sorry, better ones historically getting worse. How should we think about that in the context of longer tail -- or medium tail lines reserves?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think for people who haven't been paying attention, it's likely for them to have some catch up to do. I think for people who have been paying -- I mean, what I was describing as far as Georgia, Texas, whatever, as just placeholders, this isn't like something that just happened last quarter. This has been a groundswell that has been percolating and we just happen to be talking about it tonight. But we've been talking about this internally for not what would be measured in quarters, what would be measured in years. So, the response to those realities, those are already well in place.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay, understood. Then, final quick question. You talked about a mix change impacting the ex-cat accident year loss ratio in the Insurance segment. How is it impacting the expense ratio, that mix change?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't think it's having much of an impact on the expense ratio. What's really driving the movement, and as you saw, I think period-over-period, it only moved 0.10%. So, it's fairly small. So, I would say as it relates to the acquisition costs, we're not seeing huge changes, other than perhaps where there might be a change in the reinsurance structure that we have from one year to another year where we might have gone from a quota share to an excess of loss or vice versa. So, there would obviously be some differences in terms of where that runs through in the income statement.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):"

Maybe give us some view on opportunity there?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, look, I think the opportunity that existed yesterday, that exists today will be just as strong tomorrow. I think we have truly an exceptional team of people that are very skilled when it comes to managing the shareholders' capital. I think they have done truly a fantastic job in building a franchise that is not just accretive to their operation, but is truly accretive economically and brand wise to the group overall.

Good evening.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nYeah, thank you very much. Hi there, everybody. I just want to maybe ask a little more specific question on Brian's Berkley One. Obviously, you don't write homeowners in California. There's certain things about that market that are unattractive [Technical Difficulty].\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, a, thanks for the question. And b, I think the Berkley One team, at this stage when it comes to homeowners, they're very focused on the opportunities in the markets that they're in. Will they add other markets over time? Yes. Is California in the [on-deck] (ph) circle? I think that there is a healthy recognition and appreciation and respect for the challenges that exist in that market on multiple levels. And consequently, I think the team has appropriately made the decision that this is not a distraction or that we would like to have today, not an area of focus for the foreseeable. And so, certainly for the people of California and that insurance market and those that participate there and other stakeholders, we wish them nothing but the best. But at this moment in time, we are very focused on other opportunities that are before us.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd I want to switch to an investment question. Over the long term, Berkley shareholders have been rewarded very well through some of the alternative investments that the Berkley has made over many years. It's not been really the case in 2024 in a year which has enjoyed very significant market appreciation for public equities. Can you talk a little bit about what you see for '25? Is the positioning of the portfolio potentially improved? Obviously, not going to make foolish investments overall, but what's been preventing Berkley from realizing the potential of that part of its strategy and what can we see in the future?\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, Josh, maybe a couple of quick comments. First off, as far as alternatives, Rich had flagged what we saw coming through in a couple of our investments, particularly in the unrealized associated with public securities. So, I think it was about $150 million, $160 million unrealized, which was I think pretty healthy for a 90-day period. Putting that aside as far as other areas of the alternative investment portfolio, I would suggest that one not leap to a conclusion. Obviously, oftentimes there is value that exists that may not necessarily be as visible. So, I understand your point about the '24 year. Again, no different than the underwriting or the investing on the public securities. Our focus is long-term risk-adjusted return. And sometimes in the alternative portfolio, that could be a little bit lumpy, but the focus on total return is not something that is lost on us today just like it wasn't lost on us tomorrow. But before we go any further on to any other questions or discussion you'd like to have, Josh, maybe I can turn it over to my boss here who takes a particular interest in the alternative investment portfolio.\n\nBill Berkley - Executive Chairman (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGood evening, Josh. I think that our portfolio as a whole, especially our public company portfolio, had a very good year. I think that the performance for the year was adversely impacted primarily by one private equity fund that did not do well. It was a surprise to us on a couple of things. And it had a consequential adverse impact. We think that's behind us. But I think honestly, some of that private equity investing will be reduced as the available returns in more liquid markets are such that the advantage of private equity is somewhat diminished. That doesn't mean we won't take advantage of things when they come up, but our bogey is a little higher with a little less risk. So, it was no doubt a bump in the road, that can always happen, but I wouldn't expect it to be a problem going forward.\n\nRob Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, is there another question?\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

I think it's -- that's certainly part of the equation, but you also have to look at the contribution that the short tail lines make relative to the other casualty lines as well, which have higher loss ratios.

Berkley Corporation):\nKrista, thank you very much, and good afternoon, good evening, all. Thanks for dialing in. And let me echo Krista's warm welcome to our Q1 call. So in addition to me on this end of the phone, you also have Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, as well as Principal Financial Officer, Rich Baio. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run you all through some of the highlights from the quarter. I will follow behind him with a couple of additional observations, and then we'll be very pleased to open it up for Q&A. Before I hand it over to Rich, maybe just a sound bite or two from me, perhaps stating the obvious or not perhaps actually stating the obvious. I think the world is chockablock full of volatility these days, these weeks, these months, and perhaps this year and maybe beyond. It seems to be presenting itself in a variety of different ways, political, social, economic, and certainly natural catastrophes as well. But it is, without a doubt, a moment where the realities of risk-adjusted return come into very sharp focus. And from our perspective, it applies to both of the business activities that we participate in, that being underwriting and investing. The resilience of our business model was once again demonstrated over the first quarter. And we feel as though it is another example of how this organization is not just built to perform well during moments where there is a tailwind or smooth seas. But in fact, it is built to continue to excel or succeed during more challenging environmental circumstances. From our perspective, it's very important not to lose sight of the goal of the exercise. The goal is to create value. And in our opinion, it's not just about the steps forward you take, it's also about the steps backward that you avoid. So as we talk about the quarter, there are going to be no but-fors. There is going to be no lipstick on the pig or any other analogy. We're going to talk about what the results were with CAD activity and with a variety of other events and how we managed to navigate through it. It is the reality again that when it comes to value creation, and the power of compounding and what that means for value creation, avoiding steps backward is very consequential. So with that, I will hand it over to Rich. Rich, if you want to run us through the highlights. Please. And I apologize every now and then if you hear a cough or a sneeze, here in the northeast, it is very much peak allergy season. Richie, over to you.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Principal Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. Good evening, everyone. As you saw, the company started 2025 with a strong first quarter reporting net income of $418 million or $1.04 per share. And an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 19.9%. Despite significant industry-wide catastrophic activity led by the California wildfires, we continue to demonstrate stability in underwriting earnings and continued growth in net investment income. Operating earnings were $405 million or $1.01 per share yielding an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 19.3%. The calendar year combined ratio was 90.9% and the current accident year combined ratio excluding cat losses was 87.2%. The driver for this difference was cat losses of 3.7 loss ratio points or $111 million representing an above-average cat quarter primarily attributable to the California wildfires. Prior year development was favorable in the current quarter by approximately $1 million with small offsets between segments. Accordingly, the current accident year loss ratio excluding cats was 59.4% representing a 30 basis point increase over the prior year. Largely due to business mix. The expense ratio of 27.8% continues to benefit from the growth in net premiums earned which grew to a record $3.3 billion. In addition, the 80 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter includes a nonrecurring compensation-related benefit of approximately half of this amount. We believe the expense ratio should be comfortably below 30% for the full year as we continue to invest in our newer operating units and make investments in our infrastructure. As it relates to premium production, the company grew net premiums written to a record of more than $3.1 billion. The insurance segment grew 10.2% to our second-best quarter of $2.7 billion with growth in all lines of business. The Reinsurance and Monoline Access segment grew 8.2% to a record quarter of $439 million with growth in property and excess workers' compensation partially offset by a small decrease in casualty. Turning to investments. Net investment income increased 12.6% to $360 million. The improvement is primarily attributable to two items. First, our record net invested assets of $30.7 billion and higher new money rates on our growing fixed maturity portfolio along with strong operating cash flows in the quarter of $744 million. And second, higher investment fund income arising from transportation and financial service-related sectors. As a reminder, we report investment funds on a one-quarter lag and with the recent volatility seen in the equity markets, you may expect some correlation between public and private equity markets. Accordingly, we anticipate investment fund income may be at the lower end of our quarterly range of $10 million to $20 million in the next quarter. The credit quality of our portfolio remains very strong at a AA minus, with a duration on our fixed maturity portfolio including cash and cash equivalents, increasing from the fourth quarter of 2.6 years to the current quarter of 2.7 years. Foreign currency losses in the quarter of $19 million related to the weakening U.S. Dollar relative to most other currencies. Offsetting this income statement loss is an improvement in the currency translation loss and stockholders' equity of $24 million. The effective tax rate was 22.5% in the quarter and we continue to expect 2025 will be 23% plus or minus. Stockholders' equity increased by more than $500 million or 6.2% over the beginning of the year, to a record $8.9 billion. Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases grew 7.1% in the quarter. And our balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of more than $1.9 billion and financial leverage of 24.2% the lowest level in decades with no debt maturities, until 2037. Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you. Okay.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nRich, thank you very much. That was great.

As far as the top line goes, you know, it came in where we're up about 10% or to be more specific, if I were a CPA, I would call it 9.9%. But we are pretty pleased with that. Obviously, rates contributed to that. X comp coming in at 8.3%. In addition to that, the renewal retention ratio continues to hang around 80%. I mean, it's like balance to the ship just doesn't move around very much. But I think it's a relevant data point because it tells you as we continue to push for rate and making sure that we're getting paid what we need to get paid, we are not churning the book. Drilling down a little bit more on the insurance front, particularly as it relates to market conditions, And I would tell you that professional liability has become particularly competitive been talking to you all about the D and O market for some period of time. I would add cyber as well as far as competitive. And at the risk of being a little bit rude, which I apologize for in advance, I think transactional liability as far as the marketplace probably gets the stupid award. As far as maybe one other data point, we've chatted with you all about some of our reservations and around workers' compensation. And medical trend. And you might look at our numbers in the release and some of the exhibits and say, well, how does that reconcile with the growth that they're seeing? And let me again, similar to last quarter, flag for you that the growth that we are seeing is really driven by specialty comp. And what do I mean by that? Typically, it's a little higher hazard in nature. There is less competition and you're not seeing both regional and in particular national carriers trying to play the game and leverage the multi-line offering to get the comp. So that continues to be a good opportunity from our perspective. Switching over to the other segment that being reinsurance and excess. I would call out here. I don't think we break out all this detail, but it'll be in the queue. And that is professional liability. As a component of casualty. So our professional liability book as it relates to reinsurance was down a little over 25%. That is really just a reflection of market conditions. And quite frankly, our colleagues have the discipline and the courage to do the right thing. So we'll have to see. I've commented in the past how it seems like the reinsurance market just as it was some number of years ago, sluggish to respond to property, particularly cat, it seems as though yet again, we're seeing some similar just in the casualty lines and in particular, professionals. So we will stay tuned and see how that unfolds. Rich covered the loss ratio earlier. As far as the ex-cat accident year and how it ticked up. About 30 basis points. As he mentioned, that's really due to mix. The only other comment I would make is we are paying close attention as you would expect to the tariffs. And it is a very fluid situation as everyone has an appreciation. So trying to unpack that and figure out what it means for lost cost, that's something that we are working on actively. And, again, as that comes into sharper focus, that may be instructive to us as to how we think about both loss ratio as well as rate need. At this time, as far as the expense piece goes, you know, I would echo Rich's comment about comfortably under 30. The only other comment I would make, yes, he did flag that we had a bit of a benefit from an over-accrual from last year. So maybe that's skewed it a little bit in the quarter, but arguably, it also meant that we overstated our expense ratio a little bit as it turns out last year. It was actually a little bit better last year than we had reported. Flipping over to the investment components. So really, things are firing on all cylinders. Not that there aren't challenges, but we're really pleased with the portfolio, how it's managed, how it's been positioned. Rich commented on the duration, ticked out 2.7 years. And continued to maintain that very strong quality at a strong double A minus. I think one of the important punch lines here is the opportunity or the upside that we see both on the underwriting side and now specifically in the investment side. We have a book yield on the domestic portfolio of approximately 4.7%. We got what's rolling off the portfolio is something below that. So we're gonna see some lift from that. And in addition to that, we have a new money rate that's probably give or take around 5.2%. You got a $30 billion investment portfolio, call it $27 billion or so, interest-sensitive slash fixed income, cash, etcetera. So if you take, call it, 50 plus basis points, and you apply that to $27 billion, that gives you a sense of where the earnings power is going. It's certainly possible that at some point, you could see the interest rates at the shorter end of the curve come down, but from our perspective, the intermediate and longer-term end we don't see that backing off as anything. It could tick up from here. So long story short, the business had a very good quarter to say the least, flirting with a 20% return in an environment such as this where we saw exceptional cat activity I think is a very strong outcome. What is, in my opinion, even more encouraging is the rate accuracy that we continue to maintain while growing the business. And in addition to that, what we've been able to do with the investment portfolio. So as rosy as the picture is here, and it's not that there aren't headwinds and challenges, I think it's pretty evident that not only did we have a good quarter, but the balance of 2025 is looking very encouraging. And the foundation that we're beginning to pour for 2026 appears to be quite solid as well. So why don't did you guys have anything else you want to add? At this time? Okay. Then, Krista, why don't we take a pause there? And we're very pleased to open it up to any Q&A that folks would like to have."

And as far as the growth goes, you know, we're seeing we continue to see opportunity on the property lines. And in addition to that, we are seeing opportunity in the A and H space as well. And those are probably the big drivers as far as the short tail.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nI see. A and H and property. And within the property component, I know, I mean, I guess property pricing is know, there's so many sub-lines I'm hearing kinda down mid-single digit. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? Like, what property lines do you like? And what are you seeing in rate in property?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo as far as the insurance market space as with regards property and obviously, it's a Yeah. Space. We continue to see opportunity to push rate at a pretty healthy pace on the risk front. On the cap front, Certainly, there's a bit more competition for particularly coming out of the likes of Lloyd's both directly as well as through binding authorities that they seem to for some reason, be empowering. In addition to that, Berkeley One our private client, iNetWorth personal lines business, continues to be able to demonstrate their considerable value proposition to the marketplace and grow their footprint while simultaneously taking very healthy rate. And then, lastly, our A and H business which has a rich history of performing at a very high level, continues to be able to capitalize on market conditions.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):\nGot it. And in the reinsurance segment, I mean, again, you put up another fabulous combined ratio I guess you did an 85.4, and that's even with 10.9 points of cuts. Should we be thinking about that as a stable kind of run rate? For reinsurance? I mean,\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I don't I think that we are very pleased with the performance of the business and how our colleagues very effectively positioned it. I don't think any of us know what tomorrow will bring, with certainty. That having been said, I think that portfolio and how it has been created and put together has put us on very firm ground. Both where we are today and how we're positioned to capitalize tomorrow. So I think that we, again, remain very encouraged with that business and how it's positioned.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Securities):"

My first question I know I think in the prepared remarks you guys said, you know, pointed out the $1 million of development in the quarter and I think said seems like nothing to call out in the segments. You know, would you be willing to give us just, if it's immaterial numbers, just how much reserves in the quarter moved in both insurance and reinsurance? Yeah. Richie, do you\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have them. Rich, do you have each segment? Because it was, you know, again, I think people look at the combined and they kinda they grasp their head, but we got a lot of moving pieces that come out to this in the wash. So what were the pieces?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Principal Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo for the insurance segment, it was $11 million unfavorable prior year development. And in the reinsurance and monoline access, it was favorable by $12 million.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my second question was on the underlying loss ratio. I think you guys said mix right, in the prior question, right, Tim, on reinsurance, which had a strong improvement in the quarter. You know, we did see, you know, some, you know, year over year deterioration in it in insurance. In the Q1. Can you just, I'm assuming, maybe mix was it, you know, also attributed to that segment. Can you just, you know, walk us through, you know, what was know, going on within the underlying loss ratio and insurance in the q one? Go ahead, Rocio.\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Principal Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSure. So as you pointed out, Elise, yes, it is business mix. Obviously, one of the elements that plays into that is also our outward reinsurance purchasing that we do. And you might recall we purchase reinsurance both at the group level, but we also purchase it at the operating unit level. And we've got 58 plus operating units across the group. So theoretically, if some businesses are growing, others are shrinking, perhaps, the level of reinsurance plays into that because of the impact on the ceding commissions on the quota share arrangements, etcetera. So that's really in large part what drives that 30 basis point swing from the prior quarter.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nThanks. And then my last one, obviously, you know, you guys recently announced that, you know, Mitsumi Samuetoma was gonna take right the 15% stake in the company. I know in the presentation that you was put out, it pointed to them starting in May. Not sure if this is a question for you or them, but is there an update on the regulatory process and is that May timeframe still intact?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo they are going through the process that that needs they need to go through, and we tried to be helpful as we would with any shareholder. But I think as you pointed out, Elise, it's more of a question for them than for us. We are not in the all of the details and won't be in the details because\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd the high net worth homeowners, how are you thinking about you know, what the impact of tariffs might be? Well, as you'd expect, Rob, we're particularly focused on the shorter tail lines, both auto particularly around the physical damage. As well as property. But I think it would be a mistake for one to other lines as well. So for example, workers' compensation and what the impact could be around pharma. A lot of drugs are manufactured outside of the United States. So it's something that we're very focused on. The whole tariff situation again, as mentioned earlier, and I know you and others appreciate is very fluid. We are doing our best to try and leave the tea leaves and we are actively doing a variety of different analysis to try and figure out what this means for loss picks and how that would instruct rate need. So, yes, does it have an impact on property? Yeah. Potentially, it would. Would that include personal lines and homeowners? Without a doubt. And certainly another obvious one is auto physical damage. But while those may be the two more significant spots I would encourage folks not to underestimate or completely ignore other product lines as well. Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the pricing, sounds like it accelerated 60 basis points or so in the quarter. You know, what are you seeing in terms of outliers by line of business? Is that any different from recent quarters, and what kind of drove the acceleration? Yeah. I think it's pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAnd there are some product lines that we've talked about in the past like auto liability as an example. Where we are very focused on lost cost trends, social inflation, and doing what we need to do to keep up with that and other liability lines as well. But I as we've called out in the past, auto liability and particularly umbrella and how the auto liability feeds the umbrella exposure are areas that we continue to push pretty hard on. But I also would suggest that I wouldn't get overly preoccupied with 60 basis points one way or the other. I would suggest, in my mind, the takeaway is that the company remains very focused on rate adequacy and keeping up with trend. And I think that is evidenced both in what we've delivered this quarter as well as what we've delivered for the past many quarters.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):"

I guess know, going back to the macro crashing that, you know, with the tariffs, there's lots of uncertainty. But maybe curious if you can kinda talk high level about your view on work comp. Profitability. Recession scenario. I know you just kind of simply said, you know, keeping an eye on tariffs impact on pharma cost. But I guess curious more specifically as higher than historical wage inflation levels, has that been a material tailwind in recent years that we should be thinking about too under a recession scenario or just any high level thoughts given the the sign of business continues to be just highly profitable and we're getting a lot of recession questions. Thanks.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo I think the answer is yes. I think coming out of COVID when we saw significant wage inflation, that comfortably outpaced much of the medical inflation equation. That created a bit more tailwind or wiggle room for the. Obviously, that can cut both ways. And you know, medical costs are a little bit of more than 50% of every claims dollar. So one should not, in our opinion, under. And so long story short, to your point, Mike, I think it does cut both ways. And one will need to see how it unfolds. But, you know, again, as far as the growth that we're seeing in comp, it partly has been due to wage inflation. But even more so as we flagged earlier today as well as I think in the prior call, we see opportunity in some of the comp market that is less commoditized. And is more specialty in nature. So, yeah, I think to get to your specific question, I think wage inflation was a plus but that can cut both ways. And to your point, I think people need to be very conscious of that.\n\nMike Zerminski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. But that's very helpful. I'd be switching gears a bit to lawsuit, you know, slash social inflation. If you know, thinking kind of, looking at, you know, Berkeley's at debt disclosure and just the industries as well, you know, other liability occurrence continues to be I know you said no analogies, but right kind of dig through the Python. You know, do you feel pricing levels for other liability occurrence? I know that gets it works its way through different lines. But do you feel that pricing, is that kind of a level where directionally Berkeley can start playing offense, or do we really need to see a continue to see a material increase in pricing there to really feel like the coast is clear.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think that we've done a pretty good job keeping up with it. And the question really is how the balance of the market will behave and we are encouraged by what we saw quite frankly more recently with additional discipline coming into the market in certain product lines. That having been said, we don't know necessarily what tomorrow will bring. So will there be an opportunity for us to accelerate the growth? We'll have to see with timeline. But, again, you know, one of the things and I think you're in some ways flagging right now is how different the market is and how product lines have decoupled. And one of the benefits that we as an organization are enjoying is the breadth of our offering. So there are parts of the marketplace that we participate in where we are maintaining very much of a defensive posture, and there are other parts of the marketplace where we're finding to lean in. Other liability occurrence, we'll have to see how it unfolds. Clearly, there are many folks that have taken some bumps and bruises, particularly on the excess and umbrella. And historically, that would suggest that will lead to opportunity. And if that is the case, we look forward to participating.\n\nMike Zerminski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. Got it. Got it. They'll sneak in just a follow-up question to Rob Cox's question and your answer about tariffs. Impacting more than just the auto line. I probably just need to do more homework myself, but is there have you been willing to quantify just directionally you know, commercial property, would tariffs under their current form potentially impact loss ratio by, like, just I don't know if you have a corridor, like, very low single digit.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo, Mike, the answer is that the tariff discussion coming out of Washington particularly led by the administration, I think, is still a bit of a moving target. So for us to put a number down right now that's I'm hoping that that's something we can do, give or take 90 days from now for you and others. But right now, I think it would be premature. My message to you is that we are very focused on it. And making sure that we will take the appropriate action for a loss ratio as well as what those implications are from a pricing perspective. As well. The short answer is if it comes to be as it's been advertised, yeah, it's gonna drive up lost cost. Do I have a number for you? No. Not that would be particularly valuable to you, or valuable to us sharing with anyone at this moment.\n\nMike Zerminski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):"

Thank you. I wanted to dig into some of the comments you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have to concentrate on specialty workers' comp to understand why Berkeley grew in the quarter and otherwise tepid comp environment. But you always have a specialty as what you're writing. Is it were there a few unique opportunities that you saw in 1Q 2025? And should we expect that workers' comp is going to be a unique area that Berkeley's able to grow for the next few quarters? The industry struggles?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo I think that maybe thanks for flagging that, Josh, and let me try and do a better job articulating this, the thought, than I did. You're absolutely right that by and large, all we do is specialty in nature. But some of what we do that is specialty in nature oftentimes by the standard market is mistakenly not recognized as specialty, and that tends to be smaller and midsize accounts. So as they are mistakenly coming into that marketplace, you know, that creates more competition, and we have no qualms letting that part of the portfolio shrink. That having been said, what I was attempting to flag was there is a part of the comp market which is perhaps even more specialized. And what I mean by that, it's even higher hazard in nature. Where the standard market has a greater recognition for the complexity and is less inclined to try and come into that marketplace. And cut rates and try and leverage their multiline offering. So apologies if I muddied the waters, but hopefully that a bit of clarity.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd is there anything we can use by looking at this number to think about the remainder of the year?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, you know, just both you and I, along with others, know that nobody knows exactly what tomorrow will bring. If market conditions in that part of the comp market continue as they have been. More recently. Then we will look forward to continuing to lean into that opportunity. If that opportunity or window of opportunity were to close, then, you know, you will see us do what you would expect us to do. And we will have no qualms letting the business move in a different direction or away from us.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nSo if I could ask the same question, but about a different market, about commercial auto liability. It's been a tough market for a while. But this is the first time that I've really seen Berkeley's premium volume are really fade compared to the prior quarters. Has something changed in the last three months?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt I think what it is is this our commitment to rate accuracy, and the rest of the marketplace has been a bit sluggish. Particularly earlier in Q1. I would tell you more recently, perhaps there's early signs of a green shoot coming through. Hard to know whether that is green grass or a weed, but we remain hopeful. Okay. And if I can sneak one other in, you know, Andrew mentioned about the cats notably, Berkeley has no exposure to California homeowners. Which they avoided the the didn't avoid completely. Obviously, they avoided the line of business that was most exposed to the biggest cat in the quarter, yet this was quite a big quarter for catastrophe losses for Berkeley. Has the premium footprint changed as you've moved into ShoreTel line and expose yourself more to property such that we should revise our priors and how we think Berkeley's cat loss exposure evolves relative to the market more broadly.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nJosh, so the way I would answer that is no. Not really. First off, as far as the homeowners piece, I wanna make sure there's no misunderstanding. It wasn't that Berkeley One didn't get to expanding to California. A conscious and deliberate decision was made not to enter California. As far as the balance of the loss, as it relates to that, it has to do with our commercial lines book. And we have felt as though the property market, as we've talked about in the past, is reasonably well priced. And that's why we were prepared to take on a bit more exposure. I think that view was validated if you look at the result we delivered, even with having opportunistically modestly expanded our footprint or participation in the property space, we still delivered a 19 plus percent return. So long story short, do I think you should come away from this feeling like there's been a sea change in our approach to property and can't expose property. No. I think that would be a mistake. Do I what do I hope that you'll continue to recognize that we are an organization that is opportunistic. And when we see things that are well priced, we're willing to take on a bit more exposure yes. I would hope that that would be the takeaway. But, no, there's not a sea change in our appetite for, tax, if you will, And that's why arguably, a $40 to $50 billion event relative to our size. I think by any measure, we are underweighted as far as our cat loss.\n\nJosh Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):"

And then you know, I was I know not a big line for you guys either, but the property reinsurance growth was a pretty nice tailwind this quarter. You know, ticked up quite a bit. I guess, how should we think about how sustainable growth is in that market within the property cap market?\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R.

At this one one as it was a year earlier. But we still think that it's well priced. But as we've demonstrated in the past, whether it's property or any product line, if that opportunity shifts and is less attractive, we're very happy to let it go. So what will tomorrow bring? I don't know. But right now, we think that there's still a reasonable risk-adjusted return to be had. That having been said, you know, we all saw a fair amount of erosion at one one. So I don't know if there's another year or not. In the tank.\n\nDavid Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. Thanks. And then maybe just lastly. So there's been some efforts at tort reform in Georgia. I know you guys are a decent-sized player in Georgia within GL and commercial auto.

This quarter? Any commentary on submission growth would be great.\n\nRob Berkley - President and CEO (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo using a pretty broad brush, we are pretty pleased with the continued flow in the E and S market. Ever increasing particularly around some of the liability lines. Casualty in particular. And for that matter, excess and umbrella. As far as the property piece goes, there's still opportunity there, but probably a bit less than there was yesterday. January was a little bit more challenging, but we were very pleased to see how the balance of quarter unfolded. And tried it to be quite encouraging.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist Securities):\nThank you for that. And then, Rich, on the reinsurance purchasing that you talked about influencing the mix, which influenced the current accident year. Is that an ongoing phenomenon, do you think, or is that the there's some timing about the purchasing of that reinsurance that might have influenced Q1 more than others?\n\nRich Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Principal Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't think it has to do with the timing of the purchasing. It really is just driven by each of those operations, whether they're growing or shrinking or moving in or out of particular businesses and what the contribution is to the overall. So if you have a business as an example that we quote or share some of that out to third-party reinsurers and you don't have as much net premiums written contributing to the overall total net premiums written it will obviously have an impact one way or the other. So, no, I think if you look at our session rate, we kinda hover in that high 14 to low 15% rate. So I think that our session rate is pretty consistent from period to period. It's really just the composition across the 58 plus operating units.\n\nMark Hughes - Analyst (Truist Securities):"

Maybe give us tell us what that kinda means for the commercial insurance industry and kinda what it was like back then with stagflationary environment.\n\nBill Berkley - Executive Chairman (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, first of all, that's age discrimination. I think that the stat replacement was a problem. But the inflation was somewhat different. It was much more focused, and you saw it in it wasn't quite across the board in the stagnant economy. There were a lot of different moving parts. But I think that the industry when that happened, went through a tough period of pricing pressures but it did it wasn't a disaster by any means. I think the industry was able to move along raising prices, and keep up with that. But there was less growth because the economy really wasn't growing. So less growth pricing was okay, and the industry lifeblood of new companies and change was diminished. So flexible, modest size, and larger-sized companies did well. Not a lot of new companies getting started was really when we were to getting into the business. And you had had lots of issues, including things we faced when we were just getting into the business. So in fact, just looking back at what that was, it opened the doors to really a much improving period of time. But margins were not what they were, although interest rates moved up. So we had improving interest rates. That was with you know, interest rates started to move up where they were had been settled at 3% to where they became settled at 6%. So it was an okay time for the industry if you paid attention to risk. But, overall, bigger companies did better than smaller companies. And opportunities existed. So like everything, there's no broad brush that gives you an answer. Very, very differentiated.\n\nBrian Meredith - Analyst (UBS):"

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nAbby, thank you very much, and thank you to all participants for your time today and your interest in the company. In addition to myself, you also have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkley, on the call; as well as Rich Baio, our Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He'll run us through some highlights from the quarter. He'll then pass it back to me. I'll offer a few more sound bites and then we look forward to taking people's questions and for that matter, taking the conversation and any direction participants wish to take it. Before I do hand it over to Rich, perhaps just stating the obvious, it is very much an interesting moment in the property and casualty space. We are reminded of the complications of this industry, an industry where you make a sale before you ultimately truly know your cost of goods sold. We have been grappling with this reality as an industry forever. But there are moments in time when it comes into sharper focus than others. We certainly, over the past several years, have had to grapple with financial or economic inflation and that was combined with social inflation, which we have talked about, and I suspect we'll continue to talk about. But while on the heels of COVID, financial or economic inflation seems to be brought far more under control, there are some real threats to that. Certainly, tariffs are top of mind for all of us. In addition to that, one should not lose sight of what's going on in the labor market and what that may mean for wage inflation over time, particularly around some of the administration policies that they are in the process of putting into place. And finally, there is the big question around deficits and what that will ultimately mean for the economy. And lastly, to what extent can we expect the U.S. consumers continue to be the driver and allow the economy to remain as resilient as it's been. These are amongst some of the macro questions that we are grappling with. Obviously, there's applicability to both our underwriting activities and how we think about selecting and pricing risk. And furthermore, I think it goes without saying there's meaningful applicability to the investment portfolio and how we think about positioning that. So as always, lots of moving pieces trying to not just interpret what they all mean for today, but also how we think about positioning the business going forward. So let me pause there and hand it over to Rich, and I will follow him with a few more sound bites. Rich, over to you, please.\n\nRichard Mark Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. The second quarter marked a continuation of strong performance in both underwriting income and net investment income. Net income per diluted share increased 8.7% over the prior year to $1 per share or $401 million with an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 19.1%. The definition of operating earnings commencing with this quarter has been changed to exclude after-tax foreign currency gains and losses. And accordingly, operating earnings were $420 million or $1.05 per share yielding an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 20%. Starting with underwriting performance. Our current accident year combined ratio before cat losses of 3.2 loss ratio points was 88.4%, comprised of an accident year loss ratio excluding cats of 59.9% and an expense ratio of 28.5%. The calendar year combined ratio was 91.6%, resulting in $261 million of underwriting income. Cat losses were $99 million in the second quarter of 2025 compared with $90 million or 3.2 loss ratio points in the prior year's quarter. While the industry saw an above-average frequency of severe storms, the point impact of cat losses on our combined ratio remained flat even as the dollar amount of losses marginally increased with the growth in our property book of business over the prior year. Drilling down further, the Insurance segment's quarterly accident year loss ratio ex cat was relatively flat year-over-year and sequentially at 60.7%, bringing the accident year combined ratio before cats to 89%. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment's accident year loss ratio ex cat increased to 54.1% with a strong accident year combined ratio before cats of 83.8%. The expense ratio overall was flat at 28.5% and continue to benefit from the growth in net premiums earned, which was a quarterly record of $3.1 billion. In addition, net premiums written increased to a record $3.4 billion in the quarter with growth in all lines of business in both segments. Record net investment income of $379 million benefited from the ongoing growth in the invested assets from strong operating cash flow and new money rates on fixed maturity securities that remain comfortably above our average book yield. Investment income from fixed maturity securities, excluding Argentine inflation linked securities improved 16.5% year-over-year with an increase in book yield of 20 basis points to 4.7%. Our investment funds performed above our expected quarterly range of $10 million to $20 million with strong results of $27 million, driven by transportation, infrastructure and financial services sectors. The quality of our portfolio remains very strong at AA- with the duration on our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, increasing from the fourth quarter of 2.6 years to the current quarter of 2.8 years. Foreign currency losses in the quarter of $55 million related to the weakening U.S. dollar relative to most other currencies. Offsetting this income statement loss is an improvement in the currency translation loss and stockholders' equity of $69 million. The effective tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, which is in line with our expectations for the full year of 2025. The rate exceeds the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to taxes on foreign earnings at higher rates and state income taxes. Stockholders' equity increased by more than $380 million or 4.3% over the first quarter of 2025 to a record $9.3 billion. After-tax unrealized investment losses improved by $120 million to a balance of $249 million as of June 30, 2025. From a capital management perspective, we paid ordinary and special dividends of $224 million in the quarter, bringing our growth in book value per share before dividends to 6.8% in the quarter and 14.3% on a year-to-date basis. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of more than $2 billion and historically low financial leverage of 23.4%. So in summary, another great quarter with exceptional risk-adjusted returns and excellent underwriting and investment performance. Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to y"

Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Rich, thank you very much. So maybe just to follow on Rich's comments, a couple of additional thoughts. First, I think as everyone on the call is acutely aware, this is still very much a cyclical industry. As we have discussed in the past, though, one of the changes that has happened over the past, I don't know, sort of 5 to 10 years is a decoupling of product lines as to where they are in the cycle. So the cyclical nature still exists, but where different major product lines are in the cycle, they are certainly no longer in lockstep. To that end, a couple of thoughts on the insurance marketplace. One, the property market. Clearly, that marketplace is becoming more competitive as we have discussed for a couple of quarters now. Probably 2 drivers there: one would be a reinsurance marketplace that is becoming more competitive and is willing to provide capacity at a lower rate; and the second piece is as discussed by some of the MGA market, which is becoming clearly more active. And I'll offer a few thoughts on the MGA market a little bit later in my comments. I would tell you that the property market there is a notable bifurcation while the general direction is more competitive. The larger accounts, particularly shared and layered, as we've discussed in the past couple of quarters is where greater competition is the smaller accounts, it's not that there isn't competition, but it pales in comparison to the larger end of town. As far as commercial transportation, again, another product line where there is a fair amount of activity coming from MGAs. That marketplace, we continue to and others seem to be pushing for rate, but without a doubt, the MGA participants are creating at least a short-term headwind for that market truly going hard. My expectation is that, that's a bit of a kink in the hose, if you will, and consequently, it is going to build up pressure and ultimately, we'll inure to the benefit of responsible long-term participates when that snaps and the market shifts. Professional liability, again, a bit of mix -- of a mixed bag as we all have a shared appreciation, a very broad space. Just a couple of highlights on D&O. It would seem as though the public D&O market is beginning to find some sense of bottom private and non-for- profit D&O remains particularly competitive as some of, what I would, define as miscellaneous there is, again, an MGA component to it since people seem to be very fixated on the topic. I thought I'd flag that as well. As far as the casualty lines, clearly, there is opportunity to get the rate that the product line needs. It is pronounced both in the primary casualty as well as the umbrella and Excess. And finally, as far as workers' compensation goes, presumably all had an opportunity to take note of the action coming out of California. I think some time ago, we had flagged for those that were willing to listen that it seemed as though California as opposed to in the more distant past, this time around is out in front of the rest of the market as far as firming. I think the action taken by the commissioner approving 8.7% effective 09/01 is certainly a strong message that was well received by us, and we look forward to more coming behind that. I think one other comment I would make would be around the consumer space, particularly P&C personal lines. As you all know, we have a meaningful participation in the private client space, which is a very different business from what I would define as mass market. It is a part of the market that is built or driven by knowledge and expertise. And we have a business that is really coming into its own in that space and has been a great contributor, not just to the top line but to the bottom line as well. And those market conditions remain ripe and we are pleased to have that opportunity. I mentioned reinsurance earlier as far as the reinsurance marketplace, providing capacity within the property lines, perhaps the discipline, I think, eroding. I think we've talked about that in the past. It continues to erode. We'll have to see how quickly it remains, and what -- how steep the trajectory is, I should say. And finally, we've expressed our disappointment with the discipline, particularly on the casualty lines within the reinsurance space. I offered a couple of sound bites about MGAs just as a broad category earlier. And within the industry, people tend to oftentimes use some terminology, perhaps somewhat casually and almost interchangeably, around MGA, MGU and ultimately really falls under the category, if you like, of delegated authority. There is no doubt that inherently in many of the delegated authority models, there is a mismatch or a lack of alignment of interest between those with the pen and those with the capital. It is not that all of these relationships are bad, some of them are quite good, one just needs to have their eyes wide open and understand that it is not a perfect alignment of interest and make sure that it is controlled appropriately. That having been said, there has been extraordinary growth in the MGA space. A lot of it has been generated by new entrants that lack expertise. A lot of it has been supported by reinsurance capacity that seems to have an unquenchable thirst for growth without necessarily their finger fully on the pulse. We'll have to see how this plays out. I think for many of us that have been around for at least a little while, and those that have been -- particularly those that have been around for a long while, have seen some version of this movie. In some ways, it's the same and other ways, it's different. Perhaps the only difference is that it's a different test of characters. One final anecdote on the MGA front, I would tell you that over the last 60 to 90 days, it's been a startling number of inbound calls that we have gotten from investment bankers suggesting that MGAs that they have to sell, would we be interested in buying them. And typically, they are capitalized or owned by private equity. So oftentimes, perhaps a leading indicator that the music is slowing and we'll see who has a seat at the end, though oftentimes, that does take some time. Rich, as always, did a really thorough job as it relates to the quarter and the numbers, I would just call out the rate at the 7.6% ex comp continues to be meaningful and puts us in a comfortable place. Rich talked about the loss ratio. Again, I'm not going to go into a chapter and [indiscernible]. The 3.2 points of cat was really frequency by industry standards, modest severity. And then lastly, you would have -- it's worth noting the duration of the investment portfolio edging out to 2.8 years. Again, I think this is exactly what we suggested we would be doing if the story unfolded the way it has. We continue to believe that our strategy is the right one, making sure that we are getting an appropriate risk-adjusted return. I think as Rich alluded to, the cash flow of the organization remains very healthy. The growth in the investment portfolio remains quite significant. And if you think about a new money rate for us today is running about, give or take, 5.25 and the book yield on the portfolio ex Argentina is 4.7%. That certainly bodes well for where investment income is going for the foreseeable. So long story short, we can't control the environment, but we can control our actions. We remain very focused on making good risk- adjusted returns, the decoupling of product lines and how they make their way through the cycle, combined with the breadth of our offering allows us to continue to grow when others perhaps are experiencing more of a headwind. In our opinion, you certainly are seeing different pro"

We are not seeing it in any noteworthy way in our loss activity right now. At the same time, we are conscious of the fact that, that concept of timing that I referenced in conjunction with the point that you're flagging. And we want to make sure that we're not caught flat-footed. I think at this stage, given the -- what we're seeing coming out of the administration, it's hard to imagine that tariffs are going to prove this to be something that goes away, but we'll see. And as far as the labor piece goes from our perspective, ultimately when the day is all done, just given the position around immigration and related activities and the actions that the administration are putting into place, there is no doubt that there are certain jobs that are going to need to be filled at a different payroll point than they have been. And ultimately, that presumably will drive labor costs.\n\nTaylor Alexander Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nThat makes sense. Second one I have is on the trajectory of margins from here. I mean pricing still remaining pretty firm. It seems like you guys have been disciplined and still getting pretty good rate in there. But just wanted to understand, is it still about loss cost trend, can margins still improve from here or remain flat? And would you expect sort of mix shift with casualty being the bigger opportunity maybe to affect it one way or the other?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think when the day is all done, we feel comfortable that the rate that we are achieving is positioning us well, not just for today but for tomorrow as well. So can things improve here? Yes, I think things can improve from here. But at the same time, we are all regularly reminded that there is no reward for declaring victory prematurely. And in addition to that, we are also regularly reminded of all of the significantly leveraged variables that one should not reach a conclusion about prematurely."

Just wondering what drove that decision?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nLook, ultimately, Elyse, when the day is all done, as we've shared with you and others in the past, we have a view as to how much capital we have and what type of surplus we have at any moment in time. We have a view as to what we see is opportunities potentially before us and want to make sure that we have a surplus of gas in the tank. And in addition to that, ultimately, there's a judgment made around to the extent there's above and beyond what is the most efficient way to return that to shareholders. As Rich flagged in his notes, it's not that we weren't returning capital to shareholders, we returned a few hundred million dollars to shareholders. It just seemed at that moment in time, the most efficient and effective way to return the money to the people that belong was through a special dividend. I would strongly encourage you and others not to lead to the assumption that we are out of the repurchase market because that is not the case. We evaluate that tool, along with other tools every day. And again, what we think is the most practical answer to the surplus of capital question. Obviously, we can do our own math as others can do their math as to what we believe real book value is as opposed to this cockamamie accountant version of math. And we also have a view on the earnings power of the business going forward, which I would add, we are quite optimistic about. So again, I would encourage you not to count the [indiscernible] of the repurchase activity.\n\nElyse Beth Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my second question, you guys gave the underlying loss ratios right by segment. So back into around, I guess, $6 million adverse insurance and I think just around $8 million favorable in reinsurance. Within that $6 million in insurance, is there anything -- obviously, a large amount of reserves, but anything to call out that particularly moved relative to your reserves in the quarter?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNothing particularly noteworthy. Just us -- as we've shared with you and others in the past, we look at it every 90 days -- we'll we're looking at it every day, but every 90 days, we're looking at it at a pretty granular level and a couple of bits and pieces moving around.

Again, I think as we -- I don't know if we share it or not, if we didn't, I said that we, by design, have not been privy to sort of where they stand in their process because in no way, shape or form, perhaps back to one of Elyse's points, we don't want to be encumbered or restricted in any way and our ability to repurchase stock. So the short answer is I have no idea.\n\nMichael David Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nUnderstood. But we'll -- we should see disclosure once it gets -- it's over [indiscernible], is that correct?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI have a high degree of confidence that they will fully comply with any regulation from the SEC from a filing perspective.

And as far as I'm aware, they have not done that yet.\n\nMichael David Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nGot it. Understood. Maybe pivoting, Rob, to the medical inflation environment as it pertains to your work comp and I believe, also stop loss portfolio. We are obviously seeing all the headlines that you've been seeing. Any updates that -- I know you mentioned California as well, obviously, earlier. But any kind of updates on the macro level to Berkley's views on medical inflation potentially making their way into the comp and/or A&H arena?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, I think it has been and continues to be something that our colleagues and by extension, Rich, the Chairman and I are focused on. And as we've discussed, it's a very leveraged assumption. Maybe the only other wildcard that I would layer on top, Mike, is the commentary that has come out of the administration regarding its desire to onshore pharmaceutical in particular, manufacturing. And I think it was just a couple of weeks ago that there was a comment that came from the President that suggested he was entertaining the possibility of a 200% tariff on all pharmaceuticals that are imported. That having been said, I just read earlier today that the discussions with the EU would suggest there would be no tariffs on pharmaceuticals or medical devices. So I think for all of us, the message perhaps is just stay tuned. But without a doubt, if we saw a levy to the tune of 200% on pharmaceuticals that's something that would have an impact and perhaps to jump ahead and anticipate your question. Yes, we have done quite a bit of sensitivity analysis as to what that would mean for us. And at the moment, we feel comfortable that we can manage through that.\n\nMichael David Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful. And lastly, Rich, I believe I heard you talk about the new operating earnings, non-GAAP definition. Any -- just we'll go back and check, but does that change historicals by like very low single digits? And any reason we should be aware of and why the change?\n\nRichard Mark Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think it's really a couple of things. One, what we've noticed and we've had some conversations with some of the equity analysts over the last few quarters in terms of some of the volatility that's been coming about as a result of some of the changes that Rob has alluded to since the new administration. And with the equity analysts not really including it because it's not modeled in, you felt it was a more straightforward approach with regards to having foreign currency gains and losses excluded. And you would see if you were to go back over time, there has been some volatility from period to period, but in particular, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen quite a bit."

I think the -- I think the casualty piece that you just referred to, I think that opportunity very much remains there. I also think just going back to the commercial auto piece, I think that, that will prove to be a terrific opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit longer to get there.

R. Berkley Corporation):\nLook, I think taking half a step back, focusing on the casualty stuff, both Primary and Excess. I think the reality is that social inflation impacts the full spectrum. That having been said, without a doubt, plaintiff attorneys, tend to view limits as candy. And so the bigger the limits that are available, the more focus they get. That has been the case for some number of years at this stage. Do I think that we have seen an effort amongst the plaintiff attorney to go a little bit down market, yes, I do, but not dramatically. So when the day is all done, I think my expectation is that you're going to continue to see opportunities of the larger end of town, and that will continue to really waterfall through the whole casualty marketplace. The good news is for the smaller accounts, they tend to be a little bit more insulated and the rate environment tends to be a little bit more sticky. So similar to perhaps one of the points you were making, the property market, the larger accounts are the ones that get targeted and you get the greatest feeding frenzy around early on. Well, that applies to casualty, too. So the rates are going up on the larger accounts and casualty. But the smaller and middle market is following and it tends to be stickier.\n\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden - Analyst (Evercore ISI):\nGot it. And then maybe just a follow-up here just on the tariffs. At least on the insurance side, didn't really look like there was anything going on in terms of the loss pick reinsurance, the underlying loss ratio did tick up. It doesn't look like you guys have embedded that into your view of loss trend, maybe just how are you thinking about that? And is that something you guys are considering doing?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt's certainly something that we're grappling with. We are paying close attention to it. We are already factoring it into how we think about required rate or rate need, and we're going to see how it unfolds from here. Obviously, the impact of tariffs while it may have applied to a broader cross-section of product, it is heavily weighted towards the shorter tail lines, so APD or property. At least that's how it would appear today barring pharma, et cetera, that we referred to earlier. So that's where we're focused, and we'll see how it unfolds. But yes, it is top of mind and action is being taken from a pricing perspective."

R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think we generally are of the view that the fixed income portfolio is particularly well positioned. I think that our expectation is certainly, given what you hear coming out of Washington, the yield curve may steepen a little bit from here, and that may be a catalyst or an opportunity where we'll choose to take the duration out a little bit further. Perhaps answering the question with a slightly different bent consistent with messaging in the past, while we have not completely turned our back to the alternative space going forward from a new money perspective, given the opportunities in the fixed income market, it's a pretty high hurdle. So we're pretty pleased with how things are positioned today, and we think we have a lot of flexibility regardless of what tomorrow will bring.\n\nWesley Collin Carmichael - Analyst (Autonomous Research):\nGot it. Understood. And maybe my follow-up, just to come back to property and Rob, you talked about larger share and layered property being more competitive, but when you kind of look at the market today, obviously, there's a little bit more rate pressure there in property, but any color you can share on your view of rate adequacy of the market at this point?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think, generally speaking, it really took off to the moon. And I think it's still in a good place, and we're happy to write it, but we are being forced to be very, very selective and careful. And I think it's not just about where it is today, it's also where you see it going tomorrow. And our colleagues are yes writing business today, but they're also trying to position the portfolio in anticipation of what tomorrow's conditions will be. So yes, I think the larger accounts, the shared and layered accounts, you're seeing more competition there. You're seeing a bit more of a feeding frenzy. By and large, we're still happy with the pricing, but that will not be indefinite. And we have no problem when we don't think that the rate is adequate to walk away. And we will be there when the opportunity presents itself again as we have been in the past. I should add those comments around market conditions, again, are very much focused on the commercial lines marketplace and the private client stuff. We continue to be pleased with, by and large, the opportunities before us."

R. Berkley Corporation):\nI think a lot of the property growth is really coming from -- well, a, as I said a moment ago, we still think that there's opportunity there. So just because rates are down doesn't mean you don't want to write the business. I think the other piece that is worth noting is our private client business that I referred to before or said differently, our net worth personal lines business, and that is a contributor there as well.\n\nUnidentified Analyst - Analyst (Cantor Fitzgerald):\nGot it. And then just, I guess, a little -- maybe more detailed one, maybe for Rich, but the corporate costs or the -- I don't know what you guys call them other costs and expenses, that ticked up this quarter. Are we in a new type of run rate there? Or were there some new launches? Or just curious what's going on with that.\n\nRichard Mark Baio - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes. It's up really, Ryan, for a couple of reasons. One is with regards to the special dividend that we paid in the second quarter. As it relates to the dividend, it comes through on vested mandatorily deferred RSUs. So effectively, it characterizes compensation. And so that is a meaningful contributor in the current quarter. So that would obviously move around depending on future timing of special dividends or not. And then the second is you might have seen that we had announced a few quarters ago, 2 new operations, our embedded solutions and our India branch, similar to what we've done in the past, those expenses when they're in the incubation stage are reflected in our corporate expenses. And then when they get to some relative size in terms of generation of premium, we'll move that out of corporate expense on a prospective basis, and that would be reflected in our underwriting results."

The last thing you mentioned was being really just pleased with the direction of trend in casualty reinsurance markets.

But obviously, there's so well in some facultative and other types of business that obviously have a set price. Can you go a little into what you meant about being disappointed in the trends on the cash reinsurance direction?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes, absolutely, Josh. Thanks for flagging that. So long story short, and I should have been more specific about it, the thorn in the side is primarily the seeding commissions where we just think that the reinsurance marketplace when we're planning the assumed game, should be looking for better terms. Obviously, we have a different view when we're seeding the business, but that is what I was referring to. In addition to that, just less consequential as far as percent of the marketplace or for that matter, percent of our portfolio, we found that the [indiscernible] market is one where we would have hoped to have seen a bit more discipline at this stage. By the way, mapping back to some of the other comments, particularly around the commercial auto space.\n\nJoshua David Shanker - Analyst (Bank of America):\nAnd on the seeding commissions that you're talking about to the seeding commissions are too low in your primary book when you're trying to seed or they're too high in the reinsurance [indiscernible].\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W.

But I assume in an efficient market, the price of yield on investments should have some impact on the underwriters' ability to make money on the underwriting. When we say we don't like the direction of pricing, is pricing much worse because it's definitely for the market and certainly you as well. You're making a whole lot more money on the investment income. Is it reflective of just a different investment paradigm?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo Josh, I very much appreciate the point that have -- and clearly, there is an economic model here and there is a relationship between investment income and underwriting profit and how it all comes together to deliver an outcome. That having been said, let's understand that perhaps the most competitive part of the market is in some of the shorter tail lines, i.e., property, where investment income is making the most modest contribution. So do I think that there is an impact? Yes. Do I think that, that is going to take us fast to the world of cash flow underwriting? No, sir, I do not."

Is there anything unusual going on in the quarter catch up or something that happened?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nNot particular. I think it's really 2 things, just tying in to the comments earlier, partly, it ties in with my [indiscernible] about seeding commissions and also ties in with the comments around property rates and where they are. And the fact is the reinsurance market is not charging as much for property or for that matter, property cat, in particular, today as it did yesterday.

So said differently, I'm not sure that the insureds or for that matter, their distribution, is directing them to think about their exposure in a materially different manner than they did yesterday in spite of social inflation. It's just not something that the smaller accounts are thinking about as much as the larger accounts are. I think for -- given the rate increases that have come about in response to social inflation amongst other things, I think you have a lot of insurers out there trying to think about not just what do they need, but also what can they afford? And I know you're talking about this sort of main street casualty, but I would suggest to you that, that is perhaps particularly visible in the commercial auto space where a product line where you're seeing perhaps or arguably the greatest level of social inflation, consequently, significant rate need being pushed and more probably to come, and you have insurers sitting there saying, I don't know if I can afford this. I don't know how I make my economic model work. And sometimes, you have insurers that are sitting there saying, I'll buy the Primary, but the Excess that I used to buy, maybe I'll buy less or maybe I'll have to fix self-insure, which sadly is a big rolling of the dice.\n\nMeyer Shields - Analyst (KBW):\nOkay. Yes, that's very helpful. I just wanted to get a sense of that. Second question, you talked about the the loss cost increase that was approved in California. When you look at California workers' compensation market, is that a good proxy or a leading indicator for this of the country?\n\nWilliam Robert Berkley - President and Chief Executive Officer (W. R. Berkley Corporation):\nHistorically, if you look back over cycles, California has been a laggard as opposed to a leader. As we've suggested, I think we're probably a while now. Our view was that California was out in front as far as a firming market. Do I think it is a perfect proxy for the rest of the country? No, sir, I don't. I think California is definitely a unique animal. That having been said, I would offer the observation that if you've got a product lines rate enough eventually, it ends badly. In addition to that, as some colleagues were flagging earlier, and I think we all have an appreciation for, is that medical trend is not working in the workers' comp markets favor. And I think also, as we've discussed in our opinion, there's a pinch point or it's been artificially held back or suppressed because of how it prices off of Medicare, I believe it is, in many states. So what do I think? I think that the California response is warranted and then some. And I don't think it's a perfect indicator for the rest of the country, but it is an indicator that ultimately, if you take enough rate out of it, eventually, it ends badly and response is required."

I think that it was a very solid quarter, and again, sort of the story continuing to unfold as promised. I think it's a reminder of the stability of the earnings of the business, whether it's a quarter like 1 or quarter like 2, we're able to continually and consistently create value for shareholders. Beyond that, I think there's a fair amount of visibility at this stage, not just for the balance of this year, but beyond as to it is likely that this organization will continue for the foreseeable to be able to generate high teens, low 20s returns and we are very optimistic and confident in our ability to achieve that. So again, our thanks to all for tuning in, and we will look forward to catching up with you in about 90 days. Thank you very much. Good night."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nNicole, thank you very much. And let me echo your warm welcome to our Q3 call. So in addition to myself on this end of the phone, we also have Executive Chairman, William Berkley, as well as Chief Financial Officer, Rich Baio. We're going to follow our typical agenda where momentarily, I'll be handing it over to Rich. He's going to run through some highlights of the quarter. I may follow with a couple of sound bites of my own, and then you will have the 3 of us to -- at your disposal to try and answer any questions or engage in any discussion that participants would like to engage in. But before I hand it over to Rich, let me just as oftentimes I do state the obvious. And that is -- I think the past 90 days is just a continuation of clear evidence that the insurance industry is still a cyclical industry. And for whatever the reason may be, some would say, fear and greed. The industry continues to seemingly make an art out of self-sabotage when it comes to its own success. That having been said, we, as an organization, are not completely insulated from that, but we are able to mitigate that quite effectively because of how we what parts of the market, I should say, we focus on, particularly specialty and further more small accounts, which a lot of the challenge that continues to percolate and seems to be building momentum, again, we are somewhat protected from. So let me leave it there. I'm going to hand it over to Rich, who'll run through some thoughts, and then we'll -- I will come back and offer a few more mines. Rich, please?\n\nRichard Baio - Chief Financial Officer (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. Appreciate it. Good evening, everyone. Third quarter results were excellent with a return on beginning of year equity of 24.3%, reflecting an increase over the prior year's quarter of almost 40% and net income, $511 million or $1.28 per share. Operating income increased 12% over the same period to $440 million or $1.10 per share, with a return on beginning of year equity of 21%. Further growth in underwriting and investment income drove the strong performance, combined with net investment gains. Pretax quarterly underwriting income increased 8.2% to $287 million. Calendar year combined ratio was 90.9%, and the current accident year combined ratio ex cat was 88.4%. Cat losses represented 2.5 loss ratio points or $79 million compared with the prior year of 3.3 loss ratio points or $98 million. Current accident year loss ratio ex cat for the current quarter was 59.9%, reflecting an increase over the prior year attributable to business mix, however, comparable to the second quarter of 2025. Drilling down further, the Insurance segment's quarterly accident year loss ratio ex cat was relatively consistent with the first half of 2025 at 60.9% bringing the accident year combined ratio before cat to 89.3%. Reinsurance and monoline access segments, accident year loss ratio ex cat was 52.6% with a strong accident year combined ratio before cats of 82.4%. Moving to our top line. Quarterly net premiums earned continue to benefit from written growth, reaching another record of more than $3.2 billion. Gross and net premiums written were $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. Net premiums written grew in all lines of business in both segments. The comparable third quarter expense ratios were 28.5%, in addition to benefits from the growing net premiums earned on our expense ratio several of our recent start-up operating units are gaining scale and contributing favorably to the expense ratio. Technology enhancements are also contributing to operational efficiencies. Our pretax quarterly net investment income grew to $351 million, driven by an increase in our core portfolio of 9.4%. As a reminder, 2024 did benefit from heightened Argentine inflation-linked income and excluding such income from both periods, would increase the core portfolio growth to 14.6% quarter-over-quarter. Fixed maturity portfolio had a book yield of 4.8%. We do expect investment income from our fixed maturity portfolio to grow in the foreseeable future due to strong operating cash flow of almost $2.6 billion on a year-to-date basis and new money rates comfortably above the roll-off of existing securities. The duration of our fixed maturity portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents increased to 2.9 years in the third quarter while strengthening our AA- credit quality of our portfolio. Stockholders' equity reached a record of $9.8 billion, increasing 16.7% from the beginning of the year, driven by strong earnings an improvement of $428 million in our after-tax unrealized investment losses and currency translation losses as well as capital return of $362 million through ordinary and special dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, our after-tax unrealized investment losses included in stockholder equity decreased to $177 million, and our financial leverage has improved to historic low levels of 22.5%. We've continued to generate significant capital. Company proactively refinanced its debt when interest rates were historically low, resulting in a low cost of capital and adding permanence to our capital structure with our nearest scheduled maturity in 2037. Our liquidity remains strong with almost $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents to invest. Book value per share before dividends and share repurchases grew 20.7% year-to-date. And 5.8% on a quarter-to-date basis. Rob, with that, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nOkay. Rich, thank you very much. So maybe just a couple of quick soundbites for me that perhaps will invite a bit of conversation later on. Starting out with some observations regarding the market. The reinsurance marketplace, clearly, the property market, particularly property cat, that bloom is off the rose. From our perspective, there's still margin in the business. We'll see how long that lasts. It's without a doubt eroding. And to that end, you can feel the growing groundswell, but frankly, it's palpable around 1/1 and the appetite that's going to be coming from the reinsurance market. So we'll have to see what 1/1 holds. As far as the liability side, again, from our perspective, and we've expressed this in the past, we've been a bit frustrated in the reinsurance marketplace, drawing a line in the sand and demonstrating some discipline, it would seem as though that reinsurers are dissatisfied with the underlying rate increases that their [ cedents ] are achieving from our perspective we think that there should be opportunity to push a little harder. That having been said, obviously, it endures to our benefit as a buyer of reinsurance. Flipping over to the Insurance side, for the comment earlier, f"

Flipping over to the Insurance side, for the comment earlier, from our perspective, and again, using a very broad brush year, larger equals more competition, smaller equals less competition, which certainly bodes well for us. On the property front, highlighting that, clearly, the world of shared and layered, as we talked about, give or take, 90 days ago is where the competition is heating up the greatest. It is also pronounced just in E&S in general. That having been said, from our perspective, clearly, the small admitted space as well as select parts of the homeowners market continue to offer attractive opportunity. Not different from what we've expressed in the past as well. The world of professional liability is very much a mixed bag. On one hand, you have D&O that continues to erode, although at a slower rate from where it had been and the E&O market, generally speaking, is choppy. One of the brighter places, and by the way, it needs every drop of it and then some would be the world of HPL as an example, or hospital professional. As far as workers' compensation goes, Main Street comp from our perspective, consistent with what we shared with you in the past, tends to be particularly competitive. We have talked and talked and talked about California and certainly some of the challenges that market faces and happy to see the rate action coming through. A lot of that indigestion is being -- is coming about as a result of cumulative trauma and litigation stemming from that. GL, it would seem, at least from our perspective, for the moment, one is able to keep up with trend. Auto has been on again and off again. I think it was the first quarter where we expressed a view that there were some green shoots. In the second quarter, it was a little less encouraging and quite frankly, it remains pretty choppy. A bit of a puzzle to me, and I believe, colleagues because there is no product line that has been more exposed to social inflation in our opinion than auto, but we'll have to see what happens with that. as far as our portfolio goes, and we can get into it later, we are reducing exposure. We're taking a lot of rate. And quite frankly, our top line is growing considerably less than our rate. Over to umbrella, again, not without its challenges for the marketplace. Clearly, the smaller end of town has been the better place to be. And in addition to that, the indigestion that the umbrella line has experienced disproportionately has been impacted by auto. Rich covered our quarter in some detail. So maybe just a couple of quick observations on that front from me. Top line up 5.5 rate ex comp coming in at 7.6 different folks can interpret that in whatever the way they wish to. But from my perspective, it highlights the concept or the idea that this is an organization that is focused on rate adequacy. And to that end, we are very attuned to the fact that we are in business to make good risk-adjusted returns, not solely to issue insurance policies. You would have seen some on the insurance front, growth in the short-tail lines, just to call a couple of pieces out, what's really driving that because you may be scratching your head saying, well, how do I reconcile this? What he was just babbling about? As far as the property line and competition. There's really 2 pieces that are driving that. One is our personal lines effort in Berkley One, that being the private client personal lines. Where there is great opportunity, and we continue to lean into that. And in addition to that, our accident and health business continues to prosper as well. You would have also perhaps taken note of the growth in the workers' comp line. That not dissimilar to what we've talked about in the past is really driven by specialty comp. Some of it tends to be higher hazard and so on and so forth. It is not Main Street comp. The growth under the reinsurance banner, really, as far as the property piece goes, that's just us getting our last bite at the apple before the apple starts to rot. We have a view as to rate adequacy and we have no problem drawing a line in the sand as we have demonstrated in the past. And as far as the excess line with the growth is coming from is primarily excess comp. Risk covers the loss ratio, the expense ratio. As far as the cat goes, that was really just SCS that gave us a little bit of noise there. The expenses, again, continue to be benefiting from our focus around automation, as Rich highlighted, but please understand we continue to make investments. So on occasion with the expense ratio, you will see us having to take half a step back in order to take multiple steps forward. Flipping over to the investment portfolio. And again, I'm not going to completely pile on what Rich has already covered, but I would just flag that the duration did nudge out to 2.9 years. And we feel as though that we have a fair amount of runway before us. A, as Rich highlighted, the strength of the cash flow continues to build the size of the portfolio. And in addition to that, we see the book yield continuing to go up from here. So just as a point of reference, the domestic book yield at the -- for the quarter was 4.6%, and our new money rate is, give or take, right about 5%.  So growth in the portfolio, higher new money equals runway ahead. By and large, it was a pretty solid quarter. And it wasn't just because the wind didn't blow and the earth didn't shake in a consequential way. It's because this is the trajectory that we're on, and it would take a lot to take us off that path. So when the day is all done, the underwriting opportunity continues to unfold. The discipline remains in place to ensure that, that margin is there. And our other economic engine being the investment portfolio, again, has much opportunity ahead of itself. So let me pause there. Nicole, we are going to turn back to you, please, if we could open it up for questions. Thank you very much."

So let me know if you can hear me, but.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nYes, we can hear you. We get stuff on mute at all the time. You're coming through a couple of times a day.\n\nTaylor Scott - Analyst (Barclays):\nAll right. I'll jump into it then. So I first wanted to ask you about how you're thinking about capital position of the company and just hearing a little bit more restraint in terms of what you're willing to grow into? But you're still getting some decent growth. What would your plans be for the additional capital flexibility that, that would give you? And what would the pecking order look like?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo a couple of comments. If you were to take the rating agents -- some of the rating agency models, I don't know if it's all of them, but certainly, several of them. And you ran us through their sausage maker, it would tell you that we have significant headroom to the tune of 10 digits as far as excess capital. So loads of flexibility there. In addition to that, as you pointed out in your own words, we are generating capital more quickly than we are able to consume it. Obviously, as we've discussed in the past, we want to make sure we've got plenty of wiggle room that having been said, we're also equally conscious of the fact that the capital does not belong to us. It belongs to the shareholders. And to the extent that we are not able to utilize it effectively, we should be thinking about returning it to the shareholders. We have multiple tools to do that. And so we have not been shy about utilizing them. Rich flagged the balance sheet, in particular, the capital structure. So not in a rush to do anything as far as the debt or related securities and that would really leave us with 2 options that being dividends and repurchase. And again, we are open and regularly thinking about that question. So let me pause there. That was probably a lot of babble without specific answer that you're looking for, but I'm probably not going to be able to give you a specific answer. But this so happens that my boss is here, and he spends a lot of time thinking about capital and excess capital, particularly as our by a wide margin, largest shareholder.\n\nWilliam Berkley - Executive Chairman (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo we spent a lot of in thinking about it. There'll be opportune times buy back stock. We've been a very effective utilizer of that tool, and we've bought back a lot of stock over the years. But it's because we're not impatient, we wait the opportunity comes. We continue to do that. In the meantime, we feel that special dividend is a way to let the shareholders know, we work for them. That opportunity to buy back shares can come at any time. We'll keep plenty of powder available so we can seize those opportunities. We don't think it's there right at the moment.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nGot it. Thanks for the question, Alex. Nicole, was there another question out there?"

I ask all my best ones when I'm stuck on mute, too.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Wolfe Research):\nThat's okay. I want to go back to your comments about your excess capital position. It's my observation that this is an industry-wide phenomenon. Are you worried that the industry is sitting on too much capital and your competitors are so used to growth coming off a hard market, it's going to be hard for them to take their foot off the pedal. I'm just curious to your thoughts like what catalyst can you envision that could turn pricing around given the supply-demand equation?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nWell, maybe a couple of comments there. So we took ex comp, and we back out comp because presumably, that's sort of keeping up through weight inflation. But we took 7.6 points of rate in the quarter. So as far as our ability to keep getting rate and keeping up with trend, we feel pretty good about that. That having been said, as far as excess capital, some of our peers have a lot of excess capital, some of them don't. We're really just focused on what we're doing, and we're focused on our value proposition to the marketplace every day. And if at some point, it means that we have irrational competitors that drive parts of the market to unattractive places as we've demonstrated in the past, so be it will shrink the business. As I, in a clumsy way, was trying to allude to in my comments earlier, given the breadth of our offering or how many different parts of the market we participate in and how the marketplace has decoupled as far as where product lines are in the cycle, that positions us as an organization to be more resilient when it comes to growth. But look, when the day is all done, people may become more aggressive. Seeing some version of the movie in the past, and you and others have seen how we respond. As I suggested earlier, we're focused on making good risk-adjusted returns. If we can't do it, so be it, we'll let the business shrink.\n\nTracy Benguigui - Analyst (Wolfe Research):\nGot it. And I want to go back to your auto comments. Since your growth was flattish, can you just unpack how much exposure you're reducing balanced by the pricing you're seeing there?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't think we break out that detail. I will double check with Karen. And if we do provide that to the world, then I can assure you she will follow up with you tomorrow. But what I can say is I wouldn't have made the comment I made earlier, if it was just rounding. It's meaningful. And we're just seemingly, there are some market participants, particularly those with delegated authority that don't seem to get where loss costs are. But that end in tears eventually, and we will have an opportunity."

I do not believe there is any reason for them not to have to comply with what everyone else does. But as we also mentioned in the past, in an effort to ensure that we are not handicapped in our ability to participate in the market, we have no information beyond what you have as far as where they stand in their process.\n\nElyse Greenspan - Analyst (Wells Fargo):\nAnd then my second question, you guys saw kind of stable rate price in the quarter. Growth slowed, right, mostly due to commercial auto, a little bit of their liability. It feels like that's a trade-off, right, Rob, you guys are willing to make. I know last quarter, you said we're kind of in this 8% to 10% growth world. This was a little bit lighter. So does it feel like we're in a little bit lighter growth world as you guys look to keep as much price in the portfolio as you can?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo from my perspective, the answers, Elyse, that we have major parts of the marketplace that are in some period of transition. Some are eroding and will likely erode further. Some are healthy and others are somewhere between the bookends, perhaps going through some stage of fits and starts in our opinion is you will likely see it needing to firm from here commercial auto being an example of that. It's these periods of time of transition, which makes it really, really hard to predict what the opportunity will be over the next 90 days. So once upon a time, we tried to give guidance because we were trying to be helpful. I'm not sure if that proved to be the case or not, but that was the intent around what the growth opportunity is. I do believe that there's still opportunity for us to grow and grow at a healthy rate from here. But as you pointed out, thank you for flagging. We are not going to compromise our underwriting and particularly rate integrity in order to juice the top line. And that sort of highlights what we've talked about on occasion in the past. That's because we have a sense of ownership, obligation and responsibility to the capital we manage. We get rewarded our colleagues throughout the organization get rewarded not this monetarily, but emotionally based on delivering good risk-adjusted returns coming out of the underwriting in part. As opposed to an MGU where you know what, it's just about how many widgets you can roll off the assembly line today."

And number two, as you pointed out -- look, we -- the property market, in particular, it's been a pretty good run. So we leaned into it because we like the risk-adjusted returns that were available. As a result of that, we got a little bit more exposure. But I would caution you not to read too deeply into it.\n\nRobert Cox - Analyst (Goldman Sachs):\nOkay. Great. That makes sense. And just a follow-up on homeowners. It sounds like there's still some opportunity there. Can you talk about how Berkley One has performed compared to your expectations and where you're growing? Is it in states with more cat exposure, less cat exposure? Any context would help.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R.

It basically started -- not basically, it was started from catch with a small team of people that made it happen. And today, it is comfortably more than a $0.5 billion business and growing at a healthy pace. No, we are not leaning into California or anything akin to that. I would tell you, we have a certain group of states that we're in, and we are just going deeper this is not just an idea to try and go into every last nook and cranny. We're going where our colleagues believe the opportunity is and where we feel as though we have a value proposition that we can deliver consistently day in and day out. But no, the growth there isn't because California became the flavor of the day for us. We do not participate in the California market."

Is that a debate that's going on right now? Kind of how are you thinking about that?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo Brian, it's funny. I recall that comment from the Chairman usually about 7:45 every morning, at least 5 days a week. So I'm going to yield the floor to him.\n\nWilliam Berkley - Executive Chairman (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo I think it's always -- if you look at your business and you say, our price is going to go down more there at the bottom, how much margin do you have? And where is the current accident you're going to come out because you've had a lot of years of substantial price increases. And as all of us know, -- this is a business where you don't know the ultimate margin for several years after you've written the business. And in that case, it was 86%, give or take, we have much more margin than we were reporting. And we didn't realize it and we cut back too soon. So there are 2 pieces to this puzzle. Are you being pessimistic as to the margin you're presenting because you haven't appropriately reflected the price increases. And then the second question is where prices change and what's happening with the loss ratio. And that is the issues you faced, and it was different in 1986 than it is today. There's more litigation. There are more lawyers who are incentivized, bringing about litigation, that's a tougher decision. But I would say that you can still grow. There are still opportunities. You don't have to run away at this moment. But it will come at some point in time. We guess it's not here quite yet, but it is going to evolve to that point. It may be shorter duration because of all kinds of other things than last time because when those losses happen, it could happen all of a sudden.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R.

Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nI don't have the numbers in front of me. I think we're but as I suggested earlier, we're paying close attention to the auto liability line and we're mindful of what that could mean for the umbrella line.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nGot it. And then just, Rob, just your commentary throughout this call. I'm just trying to put numbers around it a little bit. First quarter market seemed very different, and you rightly thought you could grow double digit this year. Last quarter, you were thinking maybe 8 to 12. Should I be thinking we've kind of migrated more into the kind of mid-single-digit zone just given what you said about rates, et cetera?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nIt could very well be the case, Andrew. I think really what I was trying to articulate earlier is you got a lot of pieces of the broader marketplace that are in some kind of flux, and we are going to respond to that. So is it possible that next quarter, we could grow 4%? Yes. Is it possible next quarter, we could grow 10%? Yes, absolutely. So I can't speak with the level of confidence I'd like to and perhaps you would like me to just because of my comment earlier about big chunks of the marketplace. Being in notable flux -- improving some eroding.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):\nThat's very fair. If I could just sneak a quick one in. When you talk about Berkeley's business being at the small end of the spectrum type accounts. Any way to size that? I know you even brought a team in from -- I think they were at Hamilton or Kinsale in the small end. Like any way to size the small end of the spectrum at W.R. Berkley in the...\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo obviously, some of the business we write -- one way to quantify it would be limits. As far as giving one, a sense of scale of accounts that you write, not the only one, but certainly one would be -- and if you look at the policies that we write, some of them like workers' comp, you have a statutory exposure, so you can't have a limit on it. So if you take the stuff out of the pie, that has statutory limits like comp and you look at what does that leave you with as far as the limits profile. I was told by a colleague earlier today, that between 85% and 90% approximately of our policies have a limit of $2.5 million or less. So I don't know, hopefully, that gives you some sense or direction.\n\nAndrew Kligerman - Analyst (TD Cowen):"

At least the data points we see is the deceleration of the increased competitiveness and the growth in the E&S market, you mentioned it to in your prepared remarks, is coming more so from the pricing side of the growth equation, whereas policies in force are continuing to grow at a double-digit pace. I'm just curious from your perspective, is that if to the extent pricing continues to moderate, should we would it be normal for the policy growth to also kind of start moving back into the primary market? Or are you seeing any trends there? Because it feels like the policy growth is really what's supporting ultimately a lot of the still healthy growth in D&S?\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nSo a couple of things there. One, I think when we talk about E&S, one needs to draw the distinction between the property line and other, other being professional and certainly casualty. Long story short, a lot of the growth that we have seen over the past couple of years within E&S has been disproportionately driven by property. We've shared the observation in the past that when the property market gets hard, oftentimes, it tends to spike and then it comes back down at somewhat of a precipitous rate. As opposed to the liability market when it starts to harden, it tends to oftentimes be a bit more of a gradual sense and it has more staying power. We, as an organization within the commercial lines, particularly specialty and more specifically, E&S. We are much more of a liability player than we are a property player. So did we cash a bit on the property wave? Yes. But that having been said, the lion's share of our E&S participation on a net basis happens to be the liability lines. So when I think about this market unfolding, and I think we've expressed this view in the past, I think property has barring the unforeseen event, and it would have to be very unforeseen. I think the bloom is off the roads. I think you're seeing the retro market starting to erode that will waterfall down into the property cat market. And certainly, you're going to see that had continued pressure on E&S property. We, as an organization, will be impacted by that, but it will be far less than our peers because of our weighting towards the liability line. I think social inflation continues to be an issue. And you are going to see the opportunity within the E&S space become more and more weighted towards the liability lines, particularly casualty, I think professional is a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nMichael Zaremski - Analyst (BMO Capital Markets):\nOkay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, Rob, is back to the earlier comments on the rating agency capital models and the their sausage maker throwing out perhaps a 10-digit excess capital number. So in my words, maybe we'll make it $1 billion to buy that by our shareholders' equity. That's, whatever, 10%. Is that 10% a much higher level than historically? And do we care about the agency capital model to manage to different models.\n\nW. Berkley - President and CEO (Rob Berkley) (W.R. Berkley Corporation):\nThe answer is we care about everything, but we don't run the business for the rating agencies. We are conscious of those data points. The math you did, I'm not going to comment on whether that's right or wrong. I just was trying to articulate the point that we have a lot of cushion, and we will figure out how to deal with the surplus and what we believe is the most sensible and economic way to return excess to the owners that it belongs to. So I think if you look at our capital ratios over an extended period of time there is no moment in time that I recall that we, from a ratio perspective have had the amount of headroom that we have today."

Obviously, we try to be opportunistic at any moment in time as far as putting the money out that luxury of opportunism is not as comfortable as it was in the past. As short-term rates are coming down. So that will put more pressure on the organization to put might to work. But again, going from 2.8 to 2.9, I would cost you not to read too deeply into it. Now I'd like to go back to the first question for a moment, if I may. So our general view around loss cost trend in the environment is consistent. But our view about particular niches within the marketplace, we are constantly examining and reexamining, and that can instruct our appetite at a more granular level. It's not all on or all off."

Berkley Corporation):\nI think ultimately, it's really just about market conditions, and we are consistently in the marketplace at a rate level with terms and conditions that we find to be appropriate. The market may move away from us or when we were talking about how we were pivoting some of the other liability. It's not necessarily that we just washed our hands of it, but we have a view on rate. We have a view on attachment and we have a view on terms and conditions and perhaps the market doesn't find it palatable and perhaps the market can find someone else is willing to do it. So again, it's not that we abandon a market is that our appetite and how we're willing to approach it can adjust based on the data and the information that we see and how we process that. So that's -- and our ability to do that, we can do it very quickly. You rely on our colleagues with the expertise and various niches to decide how and when to pivot.\n\nJian Huang - Analyst (Morgan Stanley):\nOkay. That's very helpful. Very last one. In terms of the market competition, you kind of talked about a decent amount of businesses in the smaller market side of it.

Berkley Corporation):\nSo the answer is no, while we're conscious of it and certainly the health and well-being of our clients is a priority for us.

Everyone needs to assess how much margin they think is in the business. Obviously, rates went up dramatically. Attachment points shifted significantly, so on and so forth. And while whatever 9 months ago, we saw a softening, and I think the expectation is given the performance, it's likely there will be further softening at 1/1 for this coming year. We'll have to see how aggressive the market is. I we have a view as to how much margin is in the business and where -- and at what point we shift our posture from an offensive one to a defensive one.
